An increasing number of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) are being reported to be aberrantly expressed in human cancers. These tumor-associated lncRNA may have potential as new biomarkers of disease. In this review, we highlight lncRNAs that are commonly associated with hepatocellular cancer, and summarize their potential biological roles and underlying molecular mechanisms. While lncRNA can be detected in the circulation, their low expression within circulating vesicles will require the use of highly sensitive detection technologies such as digital polymerase chain reaction or next-generation sequencing.

The predominant types of EVs are exosomes, microvesicles and apoptotic bodies and these are distinguished on the basis of their size and biogenesis [<xref rid="elv058-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Exosomes have a diameter of 30&#x02013;100&#x02009;nm and are cell-derived vesicles that are thought to be released from intracellular multivesicular bodies. In contrast, microvesicles and microparticles range in size from 100 to 1000&#x02009;nm, are released from the plasma membrane during cell stress via exocytic budding. Apoptotic bodies are larger, with a diameter of &#x0003e;1000&#x02009;nm and are released from cells undergoing apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="elv058-F1">Figure 1</xref>). These vesicles contain a variety of proteins, lipids, RNA and DNA molecules [<xref rid="elv058-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Some of these may be selectively enriched within EVs during their formation. Recent studies have highlighted a key role of EVs in intercellular communication through the transfer of their contents such as RNA that can functionally modulate cellular activities in recipient cells [<xref rid="elv058-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The RNA content of EVs include messenger RNA (mRNA), microRNAs (miRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) [<xref rid="elv058-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Different types of EVs have been detected in many different body fluids. Consequently, they may potentially contribute to distant communication, an intriguing proposition that warrants systematic study.

</p><p>EVs can be detected and isolated from body fluids. Analysis of EVs and their contents may have additional utility as disease biomarkers if they reflect the contents of cells of origin, differ between normal and diseased tissue and can be reliably detected. LncRNAs are a group of noncoding RNAs with diverse functions that are becoming increasingly recognized. In this overview we will focus on the lncRNA content of EVs, and their potential application and utility as disease biomarkers, using hepatocellular cancer (HCC) as an example. HCC-derived EVs have been shown to have selective enrichment of lncRNA, and some of these such as TUC339, linc-RNA ROR and lincRNA-VLDLR have been implicated in tumor cell behavior [<xref rid="elv058-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Enrichment of some lncRNA within circulating EVs may offer protection from degradation. Although EV transfer of lncRNA may have pathophysiological relevance, the precise function of many lncRNA is not known. Moreover, the functional integrity and capability of lncRNA within EV remains to be established. However, these limitations in our understanding of the functional or pathophysiological role of EV lncRNA do not impact on their potential utility as disease biomarkers [<xref rid="elv058-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>The need for new biomarkers for liver cancer</title><p>HCC is the most common type of primary liver cancer in adults and is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, resulting in close to 750&#x000a0;000 deaths worldwide every year [<xref rid="elv058-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="elv058-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Within the United States, the prevalence of HCC has been increasing by 1.75% per year, which is a cause for concern [<xref rid="elv058-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The major established risk factors for HCC are cirrhosis, viral hepatitis B or C infection and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Conditions associated with chronic liver injury caused by diseases such as alcoholic liver disease, hemochromatosis, primary biliary cirrhosis and toxins such as aflatoxins are additional risk factors for HCC [<xref rid="elv058-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The majority of HCC are diagnosed at an advanced stage after clinical deterioration has occurred and when curative therapy is not possible. HCC is associated with poor survival. Although advanced cancers have a poor survival, with a 5-year survival rate of &#x0003c;10% from the time of diagnosis, the survival in patients with resectable early-stage disease is much higher with a 5-year survival rate approaching 70% [<xref rid="elv058-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Surgical resection has been shown to be most beneficial for tumors that are still small singular nodules &#x0003c;2&#x02009;cm wide [<xref rid="elv058-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Early detection of HCC at a time when surgery for cure can be performed offers the best option to improve outcomes from HCC. Indeed, screening and surveillance for HCC in patients with HBV and cirrhosis have reduced mortality from HCC. Thus, surveillance strategies to identify early HCC in persons at risk is justified and warranted.</p><p>Diagnostic tools for the detection of early HCC include serum biomarkers, radiological imaging such as abdominal ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and liver biopsy. Ultrasonography is frequently used for screening, but has poor sensitivity for detection of smaller tumors [<xref rid="elv058-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Widespread use of CT and MRI for screening is limited because of their cost or associated risks of radiation exposure [<xref rid="elv058-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The use of more specialized techniques such as angiography is not practical for screening and surveillance [<xref rid="elv058-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Liver biopsy is invasive, and the risk of needle tracking or extrahepatic spread makes it undesirable for use to diagnose smaller lesions that may be amenable to transplantation or surgical resection with curative intent.</p><p>Analysis of serum tumor markers is an attractive choice for screening for HCC. The most common marker used to detect HCC is alpha fetoprotein (AFP). Serum AFP levels are elevated in some, but not all persons with HCC, and AFP levels &#x0003e;400&#x02009;ng/ml are highly correlated with HCC [<xref rid="elv058-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, AFP lacks the sensitivity necessary for accurate diagnosis and often misses small early-stage tumors. Furthermore, serum AFP levels can be elevated in patients with ongoing regeneration associated with hepatic injury in the absence of malignancy [<xref rid="elv058-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although several other markers e.g. serum des-gamma carboxyprothrombin have been evaluated for HCC, they have not proven to be of greater utility, and thus, existing serum biomarkers lack adequate sensitivity and specificity for early detection of HCC. [<xref rid="elv058-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therefore, a clear need exists for more effective biomarkers.</p></sec><sec><title>LncRNA in liver cancer</title><p>The analysis of tumor-associated RNA within EVs could provide an opportunity for identification of novel biomarker candidates. While much attention has been given to aberrantly expressed tumor-associated protein-coding mRNAs, genome sequencing studies have identified deregulated tumor-associated expression of several noncoding RNAs such as miRNAs, and lncRNAs. In contrast to the extensive studies on mRNAs and miRNAs, our understanding of the role of lncRNAs in disease remains limited [<xref rid="elv058-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. LncRNAs are genetically encoded RNA molecules that lack protein coding potential and are defined by a size &#x0003e;200&#x02009;bp [<xref rid="elv058-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The majority of lncRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II, and then undergo polyadenylation and pre-RNA splicing [<xref rid="elv058-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. LncRNAs have been reported to have many diverse functions involved in regulation of gene expression through epigenetic regulation, chromatin modification, transcription or posttranscriptional processing [<xref rid="elv058-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. lncRNAs have emerged as important regulators of gene expression in many cancers [<xref rid="elv058-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The emerging relevance to cancer supports the utility of this class of RNA genes as cancer biomarkers. Alterations in expression of several lncRNAs have been recently reported in HCC. Selected examples are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="elv058-T1">Table 1</xref> and are described herein [<xref rid="elv058-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="elv058-B14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;16</xref>]. Recent studies have identified several lncRNA, such as TUC339, linc-VLDLR and lncRNA regulator of reprogramming (linc-RoR) that have been detected within HCC-derived EV [<xref rid="elv058-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="elv058-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="elv058-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

Highly upregulated in liver cancer (HULC) inhibits miR-372 activity in an autoregulatory loop that reduces translational repression of its target gene, protein kinase A catalytic subunit beta (PRKACB), and in turn inducing the phosphorylation of camp response element-binding protein (CREB), a transcriptional factor that regulates HULC expression [<xref rid="elv058-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. HULC is aberrantly expressed in HCC tissues and in the plasma of HBV-positive HCC patients [<xref rid="elv058-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Overexpression of HULC can be an indicator of lower survival rate [<xref rid="elv058-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. HULC expression is upregulated in HBx-producing cell lines, and upregulation of HULC by HBx suppresses p18 activity and promotes HCC cell proliferation [<xref rid="elv058-B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].

Starting from blood or plasma, EV can be isolated using sequential ultracentrifugation or size-exclusion chromatography and EV RNA isolated [<xref rid="elv058-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Alternatively, total RNA can be isolated from blood samples. The latter will include both EV-associated RNA as well as free or protein-bound RNA. Several platforms are available for the detection of circulating RNA and include quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), microarrays, nanostring and next-generation sequencing (NGS) [<xref rid="elv058-B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] [<xref ref-type="table" rid="elv058-T2">Table 2</xref>]. However, the sensitivity of detection of the RNA transcripts of interest is the most important determinant. While tumor cells may release large amounts of EV, the absolute amount of a tumor-specific RNA in circulation will be extremely small.

The signal intensities at their corresponding locations are used as a measure of relative RNA abundance [<xref rid="elv058-B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Because microarrays consist of short length recognition sequences, each melting temperature (T<sub>m</sub>) is different, and this may negatively affect the specificity and sensitivity [<xref rid="elv058-B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. With the use of microarrays, the expression levels of lncRNA are also generally lower than protein coding genes [<xref rid="elv058-B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. An advantage of using microarrays is that it allows for the simultaneous detection of a large number of RNA genes, and arrays can be customized [<xref rid="elv058-B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>Quantitative PCR (qPCR) is a well-established tool for quantifying gene expression that relies on an increase in fluorescence signal that is proportional to the polymerase reaction product or amplicon [<xref rid="elv058-B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Quantitative information is obtained from the cycle threshold (C<sub>T</sub>), which is defined as the PCR cycle at which the fluorescent signal of the reported dye crosses an arbitrary threshold [<xref rid="elv058-B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The C<sub>T</sub> value is inversely related to the amount of amplicon in the reaction; hence, a lower C<sub>T</sub> value indicates greater gene expression [<xref rid="elv058-B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Typically, C<sub>T</sub> values for specific genes are referenced to well-known housekeeping genes such as GAPDH. However, this could be problematic because the housekeeping genes vary in expression between cell populations. The use of qPCR is limited because it requires an adequate standard curve to be generated for each sequence of interest [<xref rid="elv058-B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Furthermore, this technique is not well-suited for detecting small amounts of RNA [<xref rid="elv058-B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. A limitation for the use of qRT-PCR for detection of EV RNA is the lack of information about housekeeping genes to enable quantitation across samples.</p><p>The NanoString nCounter Gene Expression Assay is a novel technology to measure RNA expression [<xref rid="elv058-B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The assay is based on the direct detection of mRNA molecules of interest using target-specific, color-coded barcode probe pairs containing 35&#x02013;50 base target-specific sequences. [<xref rid="elv058-B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Digital analysis is then performed by quantitating barcodes [<xref rid="elv058-B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. This technology does not require amplification or reverse transcription, and because the counts are measured digitally, it is possible to detect small levels of RNA with high accuracy [<xref rid="elv058-B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], and several hundred unique transcripts could be analyzed in a given reaction [<xref rid="elv058-B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. A comparison of the NanoString nCounter with microarrays and TaqMan PCR reported that the nCounter system is more sensitive than microarrays and similar in sensitivity to real-time PCR [<xref rid="elv058-B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The sensitivity to detect EV RNA has not yet been determined.</p><p>Digital PCR (dPCR) offers an alternative and more direct approach for detecting gene expression; dPCR involves the partitioning of a sample into multiple separate reactions, such that some reactions contain no nucleic acid template and others contain one or more template copies [<xref rid="elv058-B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The partitioned solutions undergo thermal cycling and end-point PCR. In ddPCR, droplets are generated and individual droplets analyzed using a fluorescence detector and used to determine the target concentration [<xref rid="elv058-B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Unlike real-time PCR, dPCR allows for absolute quantification of a nucleic acid without the need for standard curves or endogenous controls. DPCR also offers improved precision and accuracy, thereby enabling smaller fold change differences to be detected [<xref rid="elv058-B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. DdPCR is ideal for the quantification of EV RNA samples, and is advantageous in studies where the target RNA concentration is low [<xref rid="elv058-B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. We have reported the use of dPCR for the detection of EV RNA.</p><p>NGS offers a powerful tool for detecting RNA molecules in biological samples. NGS initially requires the generation of a small RNA library in which the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; RNA adaptors are ligated to either end of the noncoding RNA. The 3&#x02032; adaptors then bind to other small RNAs that carry the corresponding 3&#x02032; hydroxyl group. This is followed successively by reverse transcription and PCR amplification [<xref rid="elv058-B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. NGS is based on the concept of sequencing by synthesis; each DNA fragment to be sequenced is bound to an array, and DNA polymerase adds labeled nucleotides sequentially [<xref rid="elv058-B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. NGS is often referred to as &#x02018;massively parallel sequencing' because it is capable of sequencing a large number of different DNA sequences in a single reaction [<xref rid="elv058-B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. A limitation of NGS is that it provides shorter average read lengths (30&#x02013;400&#x02009;bp) than conventional Sanger-based methods (400 bp&#x02013;1&#x02009;kb) [<xref rid="elv058-B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], and these shorter reads may not align uniquely to the reference gene. The greatest advantage with NGS is the capability of producing a high volume of sequence data sets in the range of megabases to gigabases [<xref rid="elv058-B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Reduced cost and shorter sequencing times are making NGS a more viable option for biomarker research [<xref rid="elv058-B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. However, the utility for detection of EV lncRNA remains to be established.</p></sec><sec><title>Opportunities for lncRNA as disease biomarkers</title><p>An increasing number of lncRNA are being reported to be aberrantly expressed in human cancers. Characterization of these tumor-associated lncRNA offers the possibility of providing new insights into disease pathogenesis. lncRNA can be detected in EV released by tumor cells and can be detected in the circulation. However, the low expression of these in circulation and assays for clinical use will require highly sensitive detection technologies such as dPCR or next-generation sequencing. In addition to establishing tumor specificity, successful application of emerging knowledge of lncRNA will require the development of sensitive and reliable assays and a systematic demonstration of their clinical utility as biomarkers for disease diagnosis, prognosis, prediction of recurrence and therapeutic response. Such data are becoming available for several lncRNAs, for example HOTAIR and MALAT1 in predicting tumor recurrence following liver transplantation for HCC [<xref rid="elv058-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

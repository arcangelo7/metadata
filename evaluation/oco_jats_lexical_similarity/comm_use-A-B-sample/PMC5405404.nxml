Our analyses demonstrated that the bone mineral density, mechanical properties, and bone turnover were associated with the total amount of TPTD administered. Our observations further revealed that the cortical porosity was markedly developed as a result of an increased administration frequency with a lower concentration of total TPTD administration in our setting, although the highest concentration also induced cortical porosity. Deconvolution fluorescence tiling imaging on calcein-labeled undecalcified bone sections also demonstrated the development of cortical porosity to be closely associated with the bone site where periosteal bone formation took place. This site-specific cortical porosity involved intracortical bone resorption and an increased number and proximity of osteocytic lacunae, occasionally causing fused lacunae. Taken together, these findings suggested the involvement of local distinctions in the rate of bone growth that may be related to the site-specific mechanical properties in the development of cortical porosity induced by frequent and/or high doses of TPTD.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The effects of parathyroid hormone (PTH) on rat bone metabolism were first observed in the early 1900s.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1 bib2 bib3">1&#x02013;3</xref></sup> Since the achievement of the chemical synthesis of human PTH(1&#x02013;34) in the 1970s, studies have attempted to define the detailed mechanism of this hormonal action.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> The anabolic effect of PTH on the skeleton in post-menopausal osteoporosis reported by Reeve <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> was the first clinical application.</p><p>PTH is well known to exert its anabolic effects on bone through promoting the proliferation, differentiation and survival of bone-forming osteoblasts, which concomitantly induce the differentiation of osteoclasts, thereby promoting bone resorption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> The balance between these anabolic and catabolic actions of PTH administration is thought to be defined by the blood concentration of PTH, although the exact molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these phenomena remain controversial. Bone formation and resorption are preferentially promoted when blood PTH level are intermittently and persistently high, respectively. In other words, the effect of PTH on bone is dosage regimen-dependent. The intermittent exposure of PTH increases bone formation over resorption, whereas the continuous infusion of PTH stimulates bone resorption over formation, causing a net loss in bone mass.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup></p><p>PTH binds to its cell surface receptor PTH1R, which is expressed in osteoblasts and their precursors, chondrocytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells. Recent findings have demonstrated that PTH1R-mediated signaling causes two distinct processes: a canonical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-cyclic AMP (cAMP) pathway and an endocytosis-mediated pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> The former induces a transient cAMP response derived from signaling complexes localized at the plasma membrane, whereas the latter induces a prolonged cAMP response mediated by molecular complexes associated within the endosome. Studies using PTH analogs <italic>in vivo</italic> have suggested that selective stimulation of the endosome-mediated long signal and the prolonged half-life of PTH in the blood are favorable for inducing hypercalcemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> However, the association between the temporal variations in PTH-mediated cAMP signaling and the downstream cellular responses that promote bone anabolism and catabolism remains unclear.</p><p>Cortical porosity occurs mainly by the stimulation of intracortical remodeling, thus causing thinner cortices, as clinically observed in elderly women and women with hyperparathyroidism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12 bib13 bib14">12&#x02013;14</xref></sup> Recent findings have emphasized the relevance of cortical porosity as a determinant of bone fragility that is highly associated with fracture risk, although clinical and basic studies have tended to focus on vertebral fractures and trabecular bone loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15 bib16 bib17 bib18">15&#x02013;18</xref></sup> The continuous stimulation of PTH has been reported to induce the early development of cortical porosity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> Once-daily administration of teriparatide [human PTH(1&#x02013;34), TPTD] has been found to increase cortical porosity in clinical studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> and animal studies using rabbits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> and dogs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> These findings suggest that the dosage regimen of PTH affects not only the net bone mass but also the microarchitecture of bone, including cortical porosity, which may in turn affect the pharmacological action of PTH with respect to preventing the risk of bone fracture. Members of our research group have recently reported that a long-term and lower frequency (three times weekly) TPTD administration in ovariectomized (OVX) rats improves the bone density, microarchitecture, and mechanical properties of bone without obvious stimulation of bone resorption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> However, there is little information in the literature concerning the development of cortical porosity at any particular frequency or dosage of PTH administration, although such information would provide relevant information to clinical settings involving PTH treatment.</p><p>In this study, we established 15 regimens with four distinct concentrations and four distinct administration frequencies of TPTD administration to 13-week-old OVX rats as a standard post-menopausal osteoporosis animal model for PTH examination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23 bib24 bib25">23&#x02013;25</xref></sup> and then analyzed the bone properties, focusing on the development of cortical porosity.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Eleven-week-old, sexually mature female Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, Kanagawa, Japan) were used.

In each group of distinct administration frequency, the BMD was obviously increased in a dose-dependent manner. However, in comparing the groups that received the same TPTD dose at different administration frequencies, we found that an increased administration frequency didn&#x02019;t necessarily augment the BMD. In particular, when the effects on BMD in the 3/d and 2/d groups were compared, the effect in the 3/d group was found to be saturated.

In contrast, significant increases in the void volume/cortical volume (Vv/Cv) were observed in the groups receiving 30&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 2/d (H: 2/d) and 6&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 3/d (M: 3/d), suggesting that the appearance of cortical porosity is sensitive to the administration frequency as well as the total dose of TPTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>).</p><p>We next applied histomorphometric analyses to further analyze the cortical porosity caused by TPTD administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Since our micro-CT-based observations indicated that cortical porosity was preferentially observed in the ventral cortical portion of LV4, the dorsal and ventral cortical bone were analyzed and compared. Histomorphometric analyses of the ventral cortical bone revealed obvious increases in the average cortical porosity in the regimens of 30&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 2/d (H: 2/d) and 6&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 3/d (M: 3/d; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>).</p><p>We next plotted the average cortical porosity (%) against the total amount of TPTD administration (&#x003bc;g&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> per week; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). In the ventral cortical potion, a marked increase in the cortical porosity (&#x0003e;15%) was observed in the regimens of 30&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 2/d (H: 2/d) and 6&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 3/d (M: 3/d), whereas other regimens showed increases of &#x0003c;10%. For the dorsal cortical portion, all of the regimens showed scores of &#x0003c;5% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c and d</xref>). These findings suggested that the augmentation of the cortical porosity was due not merely to changes in the total dose of TPTD but also the frequency of administration. This was specifically demonstrated by the fact that, although the total amount of TPTD administered in the regimen of 30&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 1 day (H: 1/d) was higher than that in the regimen of 6&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 3 days (M: 3/d), the porosity score was &#x0003c;10% when compared with the vehicle controls. Furthermore, this phenomenon was demonstrated to be highly site-specific in the same bone elements of the vertebral body.</p></sec><sec><title>Ventral wall-specific bone outgrowth and development of cortical porosity demonstrated by tiling fluorescence imaging</title><p>To assess the site-specific distinction described above, we used fluorescence tiling imaging with a deconvolution fluorescence microscopy, which enables the depiction of the spatial distribution of fluorescence signals in a whole-tissue section<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> shows the fluorescence tiling images of LV4 for the sham vehicle control, OVX vehicle control (V: 3/d), 30&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 1 day (H: 1/d), 30&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 2 days (H: 2/d), and 6&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 3 days (M: 3/d) groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a&#x02013;e</xref>, respectively). Green fluorescence signals with calcein labeling showed active bone formation in the trabecular bone and periosteal region of the ventral cortical wall, but not in the dorsal wall, at all TPTD administration levels, indicating the stimulated ventral outgrowth of the vertebral body. Red fluorescence signals by the auto-fluorescence of the soft tissue, such as muscle, periosteum, bone marrow, bone cavities encircling blood vessels, and osteocytic lacunae, clearly demarcated the spatial distribution of the unmineralized tissues. Consistent with the observations on micro-CT, the development of cortical porosity due to intracortical bone resorption was observed predominantly in the ventral cortical walls in specimens from the 30&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 2 days (H: 2/d) and 6&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 3 day (M: 3/d) groups (shown by white arrowheads). In these regimens, we further noticed a greater accumulation of red fluorescence signals derived from osteocytic lacunae in the ventral cortical wall in the dorsal wall, which was also confirmed by differential interference contrast tiling images of the corresponding specimens (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Contribution of the increased number of osteocytes to cortical porosity</title><p>To further assess these distinct spatial distribution patterns of osteocytic lacunae, we observed the same specimens with zoomed views of the tiling images, focusing on the ventral cortical walls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

Therefore, the fused lacunae might have developed due to the increased proximity of osteocytic lacunae induced by overdose or high-frequency administration of TPTD.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study used a standard OVX rat model of post-menopausal osteoporosis to examine the effects of TPTD at distinct dosage and frequency of administration on BMD, mechanical properties of bone, systemic bone formation and resorption markers, and development of cortical porosity. In our regimens, doses of TPTD administered to rats were determined by pharmaco-kinetic comparisons between rats and post-menopausal women, whereas administration schedule was established by comparative analyses of the bone turnover rate of OVX rats and post-menopausal women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32 bib33 bib34 bib35">32&#x02013;35</xref></sup> As a common OVX rat model to examine the pharmacological action of TPTD, we performed OVX surgery in animals at 13 weeks of age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23 bib24 bib25">23&#x02013;25</xref></sup> In this model, a significant reduction in the BMD in the OVX group compared with that in the sham group is observed starting from 3 months after the surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36 bib37 bib38 bib39">36&#x02013;39</xref></sup> This study monitored blood and urine samples until 7 weeks after surgery (4 weeks after the initial TPTD treatment), and dissected specimens at 7 weeks after the surgery for morphological evaluations to observe the early pharmacological actions of TPTD, especially on changes in the microarchitecture. In fact, we did not observe significant differences in the BMD, mechanical properties, average serum OC, or average cortical porosity between the sham group and OVX vehicle group, which is consistent with our previous report.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> Nevertheless, our analyses demonstrated that the effects of TPTD on the BMD, mechanical properties, and bone turnover were fundamentally associated with the total amount of TPTD administered, whereas the development of cortical porosity was affected by the administration frequency as well as the dosage.</p><p>Under our established regimens, the groups of 30&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 2 days (H: 2/d) and 6&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 3 day (M: 3/d) showed marked increase in the cortical porosity in the ventral portion of the vertebral body. These regimen groups also showed significant increases in the serum level of CTX as a marker of bone resorption. This correlation suggests that the development of cortical porosity strongly contributes to the systemic bone resorption marker levels in this experimental model study. Supporting this notion was our observation that the 30&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 2 days (H: 2/d) and 6&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 3 day (M: 3/d) groups did not have significantly augmented ES/BS or Oc.S/BS in the trabecular bone. This finding in our rat OVX model is consistent with those from a clinical study in elderly post-menopausal women in which increased levels of bone turnover makers were associated with higher cortical porosity and thinner cortices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup></p><p>The increased trabecular BMD and the development of intracortical bone resorption mentioned above phenocopies transgenic mice expressing the constitutive-active form of PTH1R (caPTH1R) driven by osteoblast- or osteocyte-specific promoters such as col1al and Dmp1, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup> Therefore, high-frequency administration as well as over-dosage of TPTD may exert similar effects on bone properties to that of constitutively activated PTH1R-mediated signaling in osteoblast&#x02013;osteocyte lineages.</p><p>The development of cortical porosity in these regimens was preferentially observed in the ventral cortical wall of vertebrae, suggesting that the local bone environment and/or site-specific bone architecture could be a critical rationale for developing cortical porosity, as well as the regimen of TPTD administration. Deconvolution fluorescence tiling imaging demonstrated that TPTD administration preferentially stimulated the outgrowth of the ventral cortical bone, in which the development of cortical porosity was also predominantly observed. As the anabolic effect of TPTD administration is reportedly associated with mechanical loading to the bone,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></sup> local distinctions in mechanical loading are likely to affect the site-specific bone growth and the development of intracortical bone resorption.</p><p>Our findings further showed that the increased number and proximity of osteocytic lacunae occasionally forming fused lacunae induced by TPTD can be a critical element involved in developing cortical porosity. Several studies have suggested that distinct mechanical loading at local bone sites affects the microarchitecture and functions of osteocyte-mediated cellular networks, thereby contributing to the locally different properties of bone remodeling that respond to local and systemic regulations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref></sup> Therefore, site-specific increases in the osteocytic lacunae induced by TPTD administration may also be related to local distinctions in mechanical loading.</p><p>The molecules that regulate the transition from osteoblasts to osteocytes are largely unknown.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref></sup> In addition, how the ratio of this transition from a given population of bone-forming osteoblasts is controlled is also unknown. Morphologically, the transition to osteocytes involves dynamic changes in cellular shape, such as the extension of the cellular process and reduction in cell body size.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref></sup> Generally, the reduction in cell size is tightly associated with the reduction in cytoplasmic organelles such as mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref></sup> Therefore, the local vasculature that supplies oxygen to the adjacent cells may affect the rate of osteocyte differentiation as well as osteocyte function. However, how the mechanical loading and stimulated rate of bone formation by TPTD administration affect the formation rate of osteocytes remains to be clarified.</p><p>The increased size of the osteocytic lacunae observed in bone sites that develop cortical porosity suggests the involvement of osteocytic osteolysis in forming the fused lacunae and cortical porosity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref></sup> Qing <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref></sup> reported that tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and cathepsin K were involved in osteocytic osteolysis. They also reported that no osteocytic remodeling was observed with experimental unloading. These present and previous findings suggest that bone site-specific distinction in mechanical loading may be a critical factor for the induction of osteocytic osteolysis, which could contribute to the development of intracortical porosity.</p><p>PTH binding to PTH1R preferentially simulates endosome-mediated long cAMP signaling, whereas PTHrP prefers to stimulate canonical short cAMP signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> The stabilized PTH analog D6 exhibits a longer half-life than native PTH(1&#x02013;34) in the blood stream, inducing an increase in the blood Ca<sup>2+</sup> level that persists longer than that of PTH(1&#x02013;34).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> This report indicates that a prolonged increase in the blood PTH level is closely associated with the catabolic effect of PTH. The other PTH analog, M-PTH(1&#x02013;34), selectively binds to the R0 state PTH1R which preferentially stimulates the endosome-mediated long signal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> The half-life of this analog in the blood stream is much shorter than that of PTH(1&#x02013;34). However, it stimulates a longer calcemic response than does PTH(1&#x02013;34), which is similar to the effects of D6. This observation is explained by the fact that M-PTH(1&#x02013;34) binds to a specific PTH1R conformation (the R0 state) in a pseudo-irreversible manner. These findings together demonstrate that continuous or prolonged stimulation of the endosome-mediated long cAMP signaling by PTH exerts a catabolic effect on bone metabolism.</p><p>On the basis of our series of comparative studies of pharmaco-dynamics and bone turnover rate between OVX rats and post-menopausal women, the single administration dose of 6&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> used in this study corresponds to a dose two times higher than that of 56.5&#x02009;&#x003bc;g once-weekly administration used in clinical setting based on the areas under the concentration&#x02013;time curves,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53 bib54 bib55">53&#x02013;55</xref></sup> whereas once daily and three times weekly administrations in rats are estimated to be equivalent to once-weekly administration in post-menopausal women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32 bib33 bib34 bib35">32&#x02013;35</xref></sup> Therefore, our observation in this work suggests that over-frequency or over-doses of TPTD administration in clinical situations may be a causative of cortical porosity, whose development is associated with local distinction in mechanical properties of bone sites. Although these findings were obtained from experiments with young adult rats, the same regimens may also cause cortical porosity in older rats, as our previous study has demonstrated the effects of TPTD in aged OVX rats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> Given that clinical evidence has indicated the relevance of cortical porosity and thinner cortices as determinants of bone fragility and fracture risk,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15 bib16 bib17 bib18">15&#x02013;18</xref></sup> our findings here underscore the importance of the TPTD treatment regimen in inhibiting the development of cortical porosity and augmentation of the BMD. It also should be noted that, unlike post-menopausal women, the young adult rats used in this work were still growing, which is a distinct situation in the clinical administration of TPTD; however, the vertebral bodies analyzed in this work did not show obvious outgrowth, as evidenced by the observations in the sham/vehicle group. Therefore, further studies in animals with bone remodeling, such as rabbits, should be informative.</p><p>In the present study, however, we observed that an increased administration frequency as well as dosage of TPTD-induced cortical porosity was associated with an increase in the levels of systemic bone resorption markers. This finding was likely due to the fact that a prolonged or persistent PTH level at a given threshold in blood stream constitutively stimulated the long cAMP signaling, thereby causing cortical porosity that involved site-specific intracortical bone resorption, an increased number of osteocytes, and possible osteocytic osteolysis.</p><p>In conclusion, our regimens of TPTD in a standard OVX rat model of post-menopausal osteoporosis showed that the development of cortical porosity was associated with high administration frequency as well as the dosage, which is plausibly explained by constitutively activated endosome-mediated intracellular signaling by TPTD in osteoblast-lineage cells. Furthermore, the combined analysis of three-dimensional micro-CT and successive deconvolution fluorescence tiling imaging in this study enabled us to manifest the spatial development of cortical porosity in a consistent manner from the whole-tissue to cellular level. Our observations suggested that the distinction of the mechanical properties at local bone sites was a critical factor for developing cortical porosity. The association between the duration of cAMP signaling and the downstream responses that promote bone anabolism and catabolism, which could also unravel the PTH paradox of intermittent versus continuous administration, should be investigated in future studies. These molecular pathways may be affected by mechanical loading and unloading to bone cells. Further investigation and consideration are still needed to extrapolate clinical situation from data obtained from animal models in terms of the development of cortical porosity.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was funded by the Asahi Kasei Pharma Corporation.

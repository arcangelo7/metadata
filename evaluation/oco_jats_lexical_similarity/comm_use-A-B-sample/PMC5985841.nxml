The age-standardized Global Burden of Disease study estimates that 24.8% of all
deaths in India is attributed to CVD<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. Coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke are
responsible for &#x0003e; 80% of CVD deaths<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Cardiovascular surgery (CVS) encompasses several surgical procedures like myocardial
revascularization, valve repair or replacement, aortic diseases, correction of
congenital heart disease, cardiac pacemaker implantation and heart transplant.</p><p>In 1909, Horder stressed that "oral sepsis" was the prime reason for the genesis of
infective endocarditis (IE)<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. The introduction of bacteria from oral foci of
infection into the bloodstream can lead to a transient bacteremia, enabling the
adhesion of microorganisms to previously compromised cardiac tissues. CHD is
considered an inflammatory disorder<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. Dental infections, particularly periodontal,
have been associated with atherosclerosis<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. Infection disturbs the coagulation mechanisms
and activates pathologic processes in the coronary arteries. There may be damage to
the endothelium and initiation of a fibro-proliferative process in the artery,
leading to atherosclerosis<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Several studies have shown a positive association between dental health and heart
disease, but little is known about the oral health status in CVS patients. In
addition, the behavioural aspects and attitudes regarding the oral health of these
patients and their treatment needs remains a scarcely explored subject. The aim of
the present study was to assess the oral health status and treatment needs of CVS
patients. Second, the awareness of CVS patients regarding the association between
oral health and heart disease was considered.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>This is a cross-sectional, observational study in which patients admitted for
elective cardiac surgery at a public hospital were included. The study protocol was
approved by the institutional ethics committee, PGIMER Dr. RML Hospital, New Delhi.
Informed written consent was taken by patients.</p><p>A total of 123 patients diagnosed with cardiovascular disease and hospitalized in
preparation for CVS were approached to participate in the study, of which 106
patients volunteered to participate. Exclusion criteria included patients who needed
emergency cardiac surgery or those whose heart disease was so severe that the
clinical oral examination could not be safely done. The study sample ranged from
12-73 years age and male:female was 3:1.2. The CVD distribution of the study

illnesses were recorded. They were interviewed using a structured questionnaire
designed for this study, which included aspects as patient knowledge about IE, oral
symptoms experienced by the patient, satisfaction with oral health quality and
dental aesthetics, and if they carried an oral hygiene kit with them in the
hospital. Questions also included the history of past dental treatment, their oral
hygiene practices and other behavioural habits. Patients were referred to the dental
department of PGIMER Dr. RML Hospital, New Delhi, where the dentist evaluated them.
The recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO) were followed in the
clinical assessment. The oral examination included scores for caries (Decayed,
Missing and Filled Teeth - DMFT index), oral hygiene (plaque index) and periodontal
status using a standard probe. Data were tabulated, and statistical analysis was
done.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In this study, composed of 76 males and 30 females posted for cardiac surgery, the
self-perceived quality of oral health was excellent in 10 (9.4%), good in 41
(38.6%), fair in 38 (35.8%) and bad in 17 (16%). Approximately 45% (48 patients)
reported the presence of at least one oral symptom such as dental pain, decay, tooth
sensitivity, etc. Although 35 (33%) patients were aware of an association between
oral health and heart disease, none of them were aware of IE. A total of 87 patients
reported that they took their oral hygiene kits to the hospital. Approximately 60%
patients reported having had a previous dental visit whereas only 18.6% of them had
undergone oral prophylaxis.</p><sec><title>Oral Health Behaviour and Practices</title><p>Approximately two-thirds of the patients did not brush their teeth daily, and
only 10.4% brushed twice a day. Twenty-three percent of patients reported using
cleaning aids other than toothpaste, such as tooth powder, charcoal, burnt
tobacco, etc. Cleaning the interdental spaces using a floss or toothpick was
uncommon, although the use of toothpick was reported more often than floss.

patients admitted to the department of cardiothoracic vascular surgery. The WHO's
Global Oral Health Program emphasized the significance of escalating efforts to
increase awareness of oral health worldwide as a major component of general health
and quality of life<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>. Among hospitalized patients, it is generally
observed that oral healthcare is often ignored due to the burden of other health
-related duties and the priority of medical care.</p><p>The self-perception of the oral health quality of the majority of patients did not
coincide with the dental treatment needs of the studied population, since only 23
(21.7%) patients did not show need of dental treatment. Similar results have been
reported by Amaral et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. This emphasises the lack of awareness of dental
problems among study participants. It could be possible that patients would not pay
attention to their oral problems due to the life-threatening nature of their cardiac
condition.</p><p>Knowledge of the study participants regarding the existence of association between
oral health and heart disease was fair, but none of the participants were aware of
the risk of complications. Similar findings have been reported by several authors in
children<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>. This presents a challenge especially among those
who have poor oral health. There is an urgent need to educate patients with heart
disease regarding the two-way relationship between oral health and systemic
health.</p><p>In our study, it was surprising to note that the number of patients who never brushed
was significantly high. The percentage of patients who brushed regularly once a day
(32.1%) was lower than the findings of other studies<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>. Teeth must be
examined and cleaned professionally by a dentist in patients with cardiac disease.
The oral hygiene practices of these patients, such as the use of charcoal, tobacco
and salt as a cleaning aid, could explain the high prevalence of edentulism in this
study cohort.</p><p>The present study shows that a significant part of the studied population had
experienced caries as evident by the DMFT score. A direct comparison of the DMFT
score of the patients investigated in this study with other studies is limited,
since different age groups were included. A study by Rai et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> reported experience of dental caries in 70.3% of
hospitalized patients. Higher DMFT scores have been reported elsewhere in cardiac
patients<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>. The higher number of patients showing fair to poor
rating in PI signifies a poor oral hygiene prevalence among these patients. Meurman
et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>
have reported that, on average, 0.4 surfaces of a tooth are covered by plaque. Lower
median PI (0.75) has been reported in acute coronary syndrome<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>This study has some limitations that must be considered while interpreting the
results: is a single-centre study and therefore the sample size may not be
representative of all the hospitalized patients. We recommend a multicentre
study to eliminate this bias.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The principal finding in this study was that patients with heart disease had poor
oral health. Therefore, the value of targeted oral health education protocols must
be emphasized. There is a need for intensive efforts in the dental profession to
highlight the need for regular dental care for patients at risk for heart disease.
The key to oral diseases prevention is consistent daily home care to maintain good

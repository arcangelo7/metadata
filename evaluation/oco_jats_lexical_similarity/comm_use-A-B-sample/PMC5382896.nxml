arrhythmia, characterized by loss of atrial contraction, and its diagnosis is easily
accomplished by clinical manifestation, cardiac auscultation, and electrocardiogram.
The prevalence of AF is estimated at 0.4% in the general population and it increases
proportionately with age, occurring in less than 1% of those below 60 years old and
more than 6% in patients over 80 years old<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. Regarding gender, its incidence is higher in
men<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. The occurrence of
AF may be associated with other cardiopulmonary diseases, such as valvular disease,
especially with the involvement of the mitral valve<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. AF is termed chronic when it persists for more
than a year or continues after the first episode.</p><p>The non-pharmacological treatment of AF includes techniques such as intraoperative
cryoablation of the His bundle and the atrioventricular junction<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>; electrical cardioversion, with a
high recurrence rate; left atrial isolation<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>; catheter ablation of the His bundle and permanent
pacemaker implantation; catheter ablation of the atrioventricular junction and
permanent pacemaker implantation; and &#x0201c;Corridor operation&#x0201d;.</p><p>Electrophysiological mapping studies with computerized electrode system were
performed by Cox et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>, who
developed the surgical technique known as maze procedure. It consists of making
incisions and sutures on the atrial wall, allowing the spread of electrical
stimulation in the atria within a maze, and setting atrial rate.</p><p>The applicability of surgical techniques is inversely proportional to their
complexity. In order to reduce the complexity of the &#x0201c;Cox operation&#x0201d;<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>, several technical changes were
introduced, such as modifications in the locations of atrial incisions; reduction of
section lines and sutures on the atrial wall, known as &#x0201c;Mini Cox&#x0201d;<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>; and a unilateral procedure, only
in the left atrium, called &#x0201c;Cox at Left&#x0201d;.</p><p>In Brazil, Jatene et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>
evaluated the results of late evolution of the Cox maze procedure for chronic atrial
fibrillation (CAF) in patients with mitral valve disease. In addition, it has been
demonstrated that, in patients with CAF and valvular disease, a combination of valve
repair and completion of the Maze technique devised by Cox allows for the return to
sinus rhythm<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. Although of
proven efficiency, the &#x0201c;maze technique&#x0201d;, as it is generally performed, uses
dissection and opening of the atrial wall, followed by suture, which increases
cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time and the chance of complications in the
postoperative period.</p><p>The use of catheter ablation for the treatment of supraventricular arrhythmias
stimulated the use of energy sources to cause linear ablative lesions, with either
endocardial or epicardial application or both, replacing the section and suture of
the atrial wall<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. New energy sources capable of causing permanent
blockage lines have been used<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>
such as radiofrequency<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>, microwave<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> (90=17), and ultrasound
(US)<sup>[<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>This author, considering the experience with an US scalpel in the surgical treatment
of refractory ventricular tachycardia<sup>[<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>, devised a new approach, applying US and using the scalpel
(UltraCision<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) to form injury lines that would determine the
partitioning of the left and right atria, with less surgical and CPB time and
consequent reduction in postoperative complications.</p><p>Several aspects justified this research, namely: difficulties in establishing drug
treatment or other drugs indicated to eliminate CAF; complications caused by CAF,
especially thromboembolism with increasing morbidity and mortality; presence of
previous heart disease, most often injury of the mitral valve; advances in the study
of the electrophysiological mechanisms of arrhythmia; description of the focal
origin mechanism of AF in the pulmonary veins, as well as foci located in the vena
cava; and demonstration that the ablations performed with US systems, through both
endocardial and epicardial, are likely to cause transmural lesion. Thus, the aim of
this study was to evaluate the surgical treatment of CAF with US in patients with
mitral valve disease, considering preoperative clinical characteristics of patients
undergoing surgical treatment for CAF and follow-up in the immediate postoperative
period, at hospital discharge, and late postoperative of up to 60 months.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>We retrospectively and consecutively studied 100 patients with CAF and mitral valve
disease with indication for surgical treatment, regardless of race, from various
regions of the country, aged between 18 and 70 years (43.56&#x000b1;4.94 years), and
with 63 (63%) being female and 37 (37%), male. The patients underwent surgery by the
author in the period between 1999 and 2004 and were surgically treated by ablation
with US. All patients were treated at Hospital das For&#x000e7;as Armadas and
Bras&#x000ed;lia Hospital, located in Brasilia/DF, Brazil.</p><p>Exclusion criteria were: pregnant women; children under 16 years old; AF patients who
were not considered chronic, with or without valvular heart disease; people with
coronary, congenital and vascular diseases; transplant or indication for heart
transplantation; patients undergoing two reoperations of the mitral valve; and those
with other isolated or associated valve diseases (except the tricuspid valve
disease). This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of S&#x000e3;o
Jos&#x000e9; do Rio Preto Medical School (FAMERP) (Protocol No. CAAE
37374414.9.0000.5415).</p><p>Patient data were reviewed prospectively by consulting control records, including
demographic variables (gender and age). Cardiac variables included clinical
presentation (signs and symptoms), underlying disease, functional class, length of
hospital stay (days), surgical procedure time (minutes), ablation time (minutes),
intraoperative and postoperative complications (immediate, at hospital discharge and
late postoperative, up to 60 months).</p><p>All patients had indication for mitral valve repair or replacement, in some cases for
tricuspid valve repair and correction of CAF. US was used to perform the
intraoperative ablation lines, in accordance with Brick et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup>, using harmonic scalpel
UltraCision&#x000ae;, trademark of Ethicon Endo Surgery, Division of Johnson &#x00026;
Johnson Professional Products (S&#x000e3;o Paulo, SP, Brazil).</p><p>After anoxic arrest, longitudinal left atriotomy was performed by clamping of the
aorta. The ablation lines were carried out in inverted U-shape, surrounding the four
pulmonary veins, by starting and finishing at the fibrous annulus of the heart
toward the mitral valve. In patients with thrombi in the atrium and left atrium,
thrombectomy was performed before ablation. Upon completion of the ablation lines,
routine procedures were done for treatment of mitral disease with replacement or
repair.</p><p>In the right atrium, after longitudinal opening with a beating heart, linear
ablations were performed in the interatrial septum: 1- from around the superior vena
cava to around the inferior vena cava; 2- from the inferior vena cava to the bottom
edge of the tricuspid valve annulus, passing close to the coronary sinus ostium, and
3- from the superior vena cava to the upper portion of the tricuspid annulus, taking
care of the atrioventricular node.</p><p>A daily dose of 200 mg of amiodarone was maintained for six months for atrial
remodeling and stabilization.</p><p>Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median,
minimum and maximum). The actuarial curve (Kaplan-Meier) for the study of permanence
without recurrence after 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months in patients with CAF with
confidence interval of 95% was used. The actuarial curve (Kaplan-Meier) was
performed using the statistical program Statistical Calculations for Windows
v.1.8.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Of the patients studied, 86% had rheumatic mitral valve disease and 14% presented
degeneration of the mitral valve. The analysis of valvular disease showed that 40%
of the patients had mitral regurgitation, 36% had mitral stenosis, 19% had double
mitral lesion, and 5% had mitral restenosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure
1</xref>). In addition to mitral valve disease, 11% of the patients had
associated tricuspid valve regurgitation, which was also corrected with
valvuloplasty during the procedure.</p><p>

The functional class of patients, according to New York Heart Association (NYHA),
was III/IV and the average size of the left atrium measured on echocardiography was
approximately 60 mm.</p><p>

with valve replacement (10%), and associated with tricuspid valve (11%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). In addition to ablation with US, in
all patients, additional procedures to surgery included: exclusion of the right and
left atria (90%), reduction in the size of the left atrium through resection and/or

</p><p>Early results showed that 94% of patients undergoing US ablation reversed the rate of
CAF, 86% being in sinus rhythm and 8% in atrioventricular block, which was
transient. Among 6% of the patients, there was no success, there were 4
reoperations, and left atrium with severe fibrosis caused by rheumatic fever and/or
calcified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>). At the end of the
procedure and at the end of CPB, 96% of patients maintained adequate cardiac output,
even when CAF was not reversed. There was no reoperation for bleeding in the
immediate postoperative period. In one patient, there was injury of the left atrium
wall by US scalpel, corrected by suturing the left atrium. Median operation time was
142 minutes with anoxic arrest of 45 minutes. The time to perform the ablation lines
were 12.5 and 14 minutes for the right and left atria, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>

in 86% of patients and recurrence of CAF in 8%. Hospital stay ranged from 5 to 12
days, with an average of 6.6 days. Four hospital deaths were recorded, two patients
who underwent reoperation for calcified mitral restenosis had respiratory failure in
the postoperative period, and two patients who had preoperative functional class IV
and an episode of acute edema evolved with low output syndrome and unmanageable
heart failure. These 4 patients had AF in the immediate postoperative period. One
patient had sternal dehiscence.</p><p>After hospital discharge, patients were followed-up in outpatient clinics with
conduction of CPB, 24-hour Holter, and echocardiogram, initially and at 15, 30, and

performed at 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months after hospital discharge. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref> shows the results of the relapse in the

</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The results of this research show that the surgical treatment of chronic AF with US
in patients with mitral valve disease is feasible. In most patients with CAF,
rheumatic mitral valve disease, mitral regurgitation, palpitation related to
tachycardia, and congestive heart failure are more frequent. The low rate of
intraoperative and postoperative complications shows that surgical ablation of CAF
with US concomitant with valve surgery is safe and effective. Maintenance of sinus
rhythm rate after 60 months of follow-up for these patients shows the benefits of
surgical ablation with US in the treatment of this arrhythmia.</p><p>Regarding functional class, all patients showed considerable improvement, staying
mostly in class I or II, which indicates that maintenance of the rhythm with
contraction of the atria positively influenced the results. In this study, although
they are important in the evolution of patients and can influence the final results,
variables such as size of the left atrium, left ventricular ejection fraction and
functional class of CHF (NYHA) after surgery were not analyzed because what mattered
was arrhythmia with maintenance or not of sinus rhythm.</p><p>Faced with poor results of clinical treatment and increased incidence of CAF, the
pioneering study of Cox et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>
demonstrated the ability to surgically treat AF. Kong et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> compared, through meta-analysis,
the effectiveness of the Maze procedure with concomitant cardiac surgery
<italic>versus</italic> drug therapy for treatment of patients with valvular AF.
They concluded that surgical treatment is associated with reduced AF after 1 year,
with no significant increase in the average length of hospital stay, postoperative
complications or mortality from all causes.</p><p>Comparing the results of several studies in the literature on surgical treatment of
CAF is difficult due to the large number of variables analyzed and the different
classifications and treatment techniques. In a recent literature review, Brick &#x00026;
Braile<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> identified 72
studies on evolution and improvement of surgery of arrhythmias. Analyzing studies
with immediate results, the percentage of return to sinus rhythm ranged from 73% to
96%, while those of long-term results (12 months on) ranged from 62% to 97.7%. Both
showed consequent clinical improvement of the patients who underwent ablation,
regardless of the energy source used.</p><p>In this research, there was a careful attempt to standardize the sample, eliminating
patients with other diseases developing CAF, such as congenital and coronary artery
disease. Only patients with mitral and tricuspid valves were concurrently treated
because performing ablation also in the right atria is important to eliminate
possible sources of atrial flutter.</p><p>In this study, it was found that 75% of patients in a follow-up of 60 months were in
sinus rhythm after mitral valve surgery associated with ablation of the CAF using US
as energy source. This result is consistent with the literature<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. Meta-analysis of results of 62
studies on surgical ablation in patients with AF undergoing mitral valve surgery
show a significantly higher rate of sinus rhythm in these patients, with no increase
in mortality rate<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The ideal energy source would be fast, reliable, producing transmural lesions that
would not damage the surrounding tissues, and capable of being used with CPB in
minimally invasive endocardial and epicardial application. The first patients who
underwent surgery by the author for correction of CAF with unipolar radiofrequency
catheter were not included in this analysis. The development of bipolar ablation
devices with irrigated catheter contributed to the technical improvement of the
procedure with consequent shorter surgery and satisfactory operative results,
showing a 96% rate of reversion to sinus rhythm<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. It was followed by the emergence of the use of the US
scalpel, which seemed more appropriate since it facilitated the procedure, with
better results and less surgery time.</p><p>Benussi et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> described
radiofrequency application in patients with mitral valve disease. The procedure,
similar to that performed by the author, also surrounded the right and left
pulmonary veins, with exclusion of the left atrial appendage. After 36 months of
development, 77% of the patients (n=132) were free of AF. In our series, after 60
months, sinus rhythm maintenance percentage, at 83.8%, was higher than that obtained
by Benussi et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>For this author<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>, the use of US
with harmonic scalpel (UltraScision<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) began after experiencing
initial difficulty with a proper catheter to perform surgical radiofrequency
ablation and using the US scalpel in surgery for treatment of refractory ventricular
tachycardia in Chagas disease patients with left ventricular aneurysm. Currently,
several devices have been developed using US for both endo- and epicardial
application, facilitating the procedure and making surgery less invasive and
safer.</p><p>The success rate of CAF reversal of this study is compared to that of other
authors<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup>, using
various energy sources and techniques, such as radiofrequency, cryoablation, and US,
and performing the atrial ablation lines in the same way.</p><p>In this series, analyzing immediate and hospital outcomes, maintenance of sinus
rhythm was observed in 94% and 86% of patients, respectively. Lins et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>, when comparing patients
undergoing US ablation to those who did not, found that 80% of the patients treated
with US were free of AF whereas, in the other group, that occurred to only 30% of
the patients. The results observed in this study are similar to those obtained in
the study presented herein, showing that US ablation can be applied in patients with
surgical indication for mitral valve disease repair.</p><p>In this research, the right atrium approach (biatrial) was performed in all patients
because it was considered important to treat and prevent atrial flutter, which is
related to the vena cava and right atrium. When comparing results obtained in
patients with AF associated with mitral valve disease who underwent left or biatrial
atrial ablation, Kim et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup>
found that biatrial ablation was more effective in restoring and maintaining sinus
rhythm without increasing the risk of postoperative complications.</p><p>In this series, the operative results were also safe, with complications related to
the ablation procedure (lesion in the left atrium) in only one patient and immediate
results of reversion to sinus rhythm of 94% and 83.8% after 60 months. The reduction
of recurrence rates to maintain sinus rhythm can be observed over time.</p><p>The operative times in this study were satisfactory compared with other techniques
for the surgical treatment of CAF. Median time of operation was 142 minutes with
anoxic arrest of 45 minutes. The time to perform the ablation lines was 12.5 minutes
in the right atrium and 14 minutes in the left atrium.</p><p>The complications in the postoperative period, such as low cardiac output syndrome
and respiratory failure, were not related to the non-reversal of arrhythmia;
however, due to complications after surgery, those patients did not maintain sinus
rhythm. In this study, mortality rate was 4%, unrelated to arrhythmia.</p><p>AF has been neglected for being considered benign. However, it is associated with
many potentially lethal complications, with high morbidity and mortality rates. Some
questions should be asked for the treatment of AF, namely: Is it reversible? What is
the arrhythmia time? Are there related symptoms? Is there a structural disease base?
In the case of mitral valve disease with surgical indication, what is the age and
clinical condition of the patient? And, finally, what is the best treatment option
and the impact on morbidity and mortality?</p><p>In addition to the endocardial application, US and other devices can be used in
off-pump surgery, through epicardial application in patients with isolated
fibrillation. The aim of the Consensus of the International Society for Minimally
Invasive Cardiothoracic Surgery (ISMICS)<sup>[<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> was to determine whether surgical ablation of AF during
associated cardiac procedures improves postoperative clinical outcomes. The group
involved in the study analyzed the best available evidence, with systematic data
review, including randomized and nonrandomized controlled studies, always in
descending order of importance. A systematic review with meta-analysis identified 10
randomized trials (650 patients) and 23 non-randomized (3997 patients) trials,
mostly published in English and performed in the United States.</p><p>The authors of the consensus study defined the following recommendation: in patients
with persistent and permanent AF, surgical ablation is recommended to increase the
incidence of sinus rhythm in the short- and long-term (Class 1, Level A); reduce the
risk of stroke and thromboembolic events (Class 2a, level B); increase exercise
tolerance and improve ventricular function (Class 2a, level A); and increase
survival (Class 2a, level B)<sup>[<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The use of the US technique for treatment of CAF with mitral valve disease is easy to
perform, with a low complication rate and minimum surgical and CPB time. It can be
reproduced by several cardiac surgery centers, requiring only the US scalpel, which
exists in most hospitals that perform laparoscopic surgery. From the classic maze
surgery (Cox Maze), changes in AF surgery have been occurring using alternative
energy sources. The results of the surgical ablation of the CAF in patients with
mitral valve disease depend on the energy source used, the lesion produced being
transmural and applied in the two atria, and, with current technology, being
minimally invasive.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Patients with rheumatic mitral valve disease often have mitral valve failure and
mitral stenosis, palpitations related to tachycardia by CAF, and congestive heart
failure. Surgical treatment of CAF with US concomitant with mitral valve surgery is
feasible and satisfactory, with maintenance of sinus rhythm in most patients (83.8%)
after 60 months of follow-up.</p><table-wrap id="t3" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="10%" span="1"/><col width="90%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors&#x02019; roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">AVB</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Study design; writing of the manuscript or critical

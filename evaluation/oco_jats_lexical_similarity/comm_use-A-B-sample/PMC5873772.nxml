the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), cardiac arrest and ischemia contributes to
this<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. The most significant
contributors to immune suppression are still yet to be determined. It seems that the
survival of cancer patients who undergo cardiac surgery is more closely related to
the progression of the tumor than the surgical procedure<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. The reported results show a
non-statistically significant increase in the risk of cancer-specific mortality for
patients who underwent CPB before any diagnosis of cancer. In addition, a
non-statistically significant increase was observed in the case-fatality rate for
those cancer patients who underwent CPB surgery before the cancer diagnosis, and no
difference was found in cancer stage at the time of diagnosis, with no impact on the
relative risk of mortality. Further research is needed to know whether the transient
immunosuppression associated with CPB can promote the spread and growth of
pre-existing cancer cells, emphasizing that lung cancer and skin melanoma have had
the most extensive association studies. In conclusion, adverse effects of CPB on
cancer prognosis are expected but have not been confirmed. This editorial was
motivated by the experience of an isolated case of an emphysematous, chronic smoker
patient, who presented an impressive spread of an oat cell lung tumor 20 to 30 days
after myocardial revascularization.</p><p>After our traditional "highlight", we recommend an attentive reading of the editorial
by Prof. Rui Almeida that marks the beginning of his presidency at the Sociedade
Brasileira de Cirurgia Cardiovascular (Brazilian Society of Cardiovascular Surgery).
In addition, a second exciting editorial, written by Professors Luciano Albuquerque
and Walter Gomes, who give us in this edition of the Brazilian Journal of
Cardiovascular Surgery (BJCVS), a magnificent analytical study about the ORBITA
trial that deserves the full attention of our readers.</p><p>Prof. Rui's reflections on training new generations of cardiac surgeons is a top
priority for the future of our specialty, beginning with scientific initiation,
medical residency, and class defense. It should be stressed that this has been a
concern throughout the world, so we must join forces in the direction of these
goals. Sure enough, BJCVS is a potent weapon for this purpose.</p><p>The ORBITA trial, recently published in The Lancet journal, brought important
responses concerning possible placebo effect in stable angina treated by
percutaneous intervention. Considering the ORBITA study as the best-designed trial
comparing conservative and interventional strategies in patients with stable angina,
doctors Albuquerque and Gomes, based on the rigor of the design trial, emphasize
that percutaneous coronary intervention has a powerful placebo effect and should
have an impact in forthcomings guidelines of stable coronary disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Articles in this Issue</title><p>This issue of BJCVS presents a blind peer-reviewed selection of 16 articles that will

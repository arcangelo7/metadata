said Dr Douglas Bettcher, director of WHO&#x02019;s Department for the Prevention of Noncommunicable diseases.</p><p>In addition to raising tobacco taxes, the other MPOWER measures are: monitoring tobacco use and prevention policies; protecting people from tobacco smoke; offering help to quit tobacco use; warning people about the dangers of tobacco; enforcing bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/tobacco/global_report/2015/report/">http://www.who.int/tobacco/global_report/2015/report/</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>Financing future health</title><p>WHO Director-General Dr Margaret Chan called on countries to scale up their health investments as they move towards universal health coverage at the Third United Nations Financing for Development Conference in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, last month.</p><p>The conference looked at how the international community can boost its cooperation with low- and lower-middle income countries to combine domestic and external funding to build and maintain robust health systems.</p><p>Next month governments are due to adopt the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.</p><p>One of the proposed 17 goals is on health (Goal 3) and this goal comprises 13 targets, including one on universal health coverage.</p><p>A recent WHO&#x02013;World Bank Group report studied global access to essential health services &#x02013; including family planning, antenatal care, skilled birth attendance, child immunization, antiretroviral therapy, tuberculosis treatment, and access to clean water and sanitation &#x02013; in 2013, and found that an estimated 400 million people lacked access to at least one of these types of services.</p><p>The <italic>Tracking universal health coverage: first global monitoring report </italic>found that, across 37 countries, 6% of the population was tipped or pushed further into extreme poverty (living on US$ 1.25/day) because they had to pay for health services out of their own pockets, the report said.</p><p>In 2013, 32% of global health expenditure came from out-of-pocket payments, down from 36% in 2000, the report noted.</p><p>&#x0201c;While this is the right direction, the 2013 figure is nevertheless considered an indication that in many countries out-of-pocket payments are still too high (below 20% of total health expenditure is usually a good indication of reduced risk of catastrophic health spending),&#x0201d; said the report.</p><p>WHO and the World Bank Group recommend that countries pursuing universal health coverage should aim to achieve a minimum of 80% population coverage of essential health services, and that everyone should be protected from catastrophic health spending.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/174536/1/9789241564977_eng.pdf?ua=1">http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/174536/1/9789241564977_eng.pdf?ua=1</ext-link></p><boxed-text id="Bb" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Cover photo</title></caption><p>Market vendors in District 5 of Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam, selling a selection of fresh local produce including fish, sea food and vegetables.

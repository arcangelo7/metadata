This study aims to investigate spectators&#x02019; reasons for attending and assess spectator physical activity (PA) (measured by step count).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Spectators at the Paul Lawrie Matchplay event in Scotland (August 2016) were invited to take part in this study. They were asked to complete a brief questionnaire with items to assess (1) demographics, (2) reasons for attendance and (3) baseline PA. In addition, participants were requested to wear a pedometer from time of entry to the venue until exit.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 339 spectators were recruited to the study and out of which 329 (97.2%) returned step-count data. Spectators took a mean of 11&#x02009;589 steps (SD 4531). &#x02018;Fresh air&#x02019; (rated median 9 out of 10) then &#x02018;watching star players&#x02019;, &#x02018;exercise/physical activity&#x02019;, &#x02018;time with friends and family&#x02019; and &#x02018;atmosphere&#x02019; (all median 8 out of 10) were rated the most important reasons for attending.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study is the first to assess spectator physical activity while watching golf (measured by step count). Obtaining exercise/PA is rated as an important reason for attending a tournament by many golf spectators. Spectating at a golf tournament can provide HEPA. 82.9% of spectators achieved the recommended daily step count while spectating. Further research directly assessing whether spectating may constitute a &#x02018;teachable moment&#x02019;, for increasing physical activity beyond the tournament itself, is merited.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>physical activity</kwd><kwd>golf</kwd><kwd>health</kwd><kwd>spectating</kwd><kwd>public health</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>World Golf Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Background</title><p>Researchers, policy-makers and practitioners concur that regular physical activity (PA) benefits persons of all ages and backgrounds.

We had specified criteria for inclusion and exclusion of data. When pedometers were returned, the values were entered into the database, and the researcher assessed them for face validity.

The median rating was 8 out of 10, with a mode of 10, representing &#x02018;of extremely high importance&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>The extent to which spectating delivers an opportunity for PA</title><p>This is the first published study to measure golf spectator PA by step count. Data show participants took a mean of 11&#x02009;589 (SD 4531, range 25&#x02009;002) and a median of 11&#x02009;086 steps.

</p><p>Watching star players is the most powerful motivator for golf spectator attendance in most previous studies conducted,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;17</xref> and the current study supports the importance spectators place on this. Robinson <italic>et al</italic> argue that the prime marketing focus for events should be on specific well-recognised golfers playing.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> However, spectators in our sample rate at least equally highly other reasons for spectating including &#x02018;fresh air&#x02019;, &#x02018;spending time with friends and family&#x02019; and &#x02018;exercise/physical activity&#x02019;. These data support Lyu and Lee&#x02019;s assertion that factors such as these offer attractive marketing angles to tournament organisers/promoters, with the aim of increasing spectator volume and engagement.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
</p><p>These factors were not probed as explicitly in Robinson <italic>et al</italic>&#x02019;s study of US spectators, with the questionnaire employed not golf specific. It is known motivations for golf spectators are different to team sports, being broader and less homogeneous.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Spectator attitudes towards changing exercise/PA</title><p>Evidence from North America, Asia and Europe is consistent and growing that exercise/PA can be a motivator for attending golf tournaments.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;17</xref> Golf tournaments and their spectators are heterogeneous, and some may be more motivated than others by PA benefits based on individual, cultural, climactic and tournament differences. They may also be likely to be meeting minimum PA levels already. Our study did not find significant age-related and gender-related differences in attitudes of spectators towards exercise/PA. The literature broadly supports a greater emphasis of these benefits by event promoters,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;17</xref> which may be beneficial in terms of engagement with spectators, local communities and funding organisations.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>PA gained while spectating</title><p>There are no previous published studies that measured the levels of PA attained by golf spectators. Unpublished data (obtained via personal correspondence, Event Scotland) from the 2014 Ryder Cup, Gleneagles, UK, show over 20&#x02009;000 spectators tagged every checkpoint at locations on course, indicating they had walked 8&#x000a0;kilometres each, or 100&#x02009;000 miles collectively. At the 2016 Shenzhen Open, Shenzhen, China, 6500 spectators completed a &#x02018;health walk&#x02019; intervention, of 10&#x02009;km each, adding up to a distance seven&#x000a0;times the length of the Great Wall of China (personal communication, Shenzhen Open).</p><p>Step counting using pedometers is a well-established method of measuring PA by the general public, researchers and policy-makers.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Data showed that 82.9% of participants met Tudor-Locke <italic>et al</italic>&#x02019;s moderate to vigorous physical activity daily guidelines (&#x0003e;7500&#x02009;steps) from activity while spectating alone, when measured by step count. This is the first study to report PA levels in golf spectators. The self-reported interest in exercise/PA as a reason for attending may be important in explaining the high level of PA achieved. For some, attending the event may represent a deliberate attempt to gain HEPA, while others gain incidental HEPA through their desire to observe particular golfers or the course.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> Female step count may be lower than male spectators due to factors that may include footwear choice. Equivalent studies of spectator populations&#x02019; PA at other tournaments would likely be influenced (positively or negatively) by factors including but not limited to ambient weather conditions, cultural factors, type of tournament and terrain/walkability of the golf course.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Recommendations for practice/policy and research</title><p>Recent strategies from the Department of Culture, Media and Sport and Sport England among others have highlighted the value of spectating at sporting venues and the potential for inspiration and increasing PA.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref> Increasingly, sports organisations/franchises, governing bodies for sport, stadia operators and others are being encouraged to develop practices and policies that promote improved public health for fans and communities. These include efforts relating to healthy eating, alcohol consumption, tobacco use and sustainability as well as promoting PA.</p><p>This study confirms it is feasible to study spectator PA and attitudes towards PA in a golf setting. Response rates were good, and compliance rates among participants were exceedingly high. We showed that a reasonable sample size can be achieved with a team of six trained researchers. This will be important information for future work and potential power calculations for sample size requirements. A well-structured questionnaire and collaboration with the tournament organisers are also highly recommended.</p><p>Golf spectating does offer an opportunity for PA in this setting and population. Attendance can thus be encouraged, and spectators can be supported to do so in an active fashion in promotional efforts ahead of and during each professional golf event. Golf tournament event planning, marketing efforts, golf course choice and architecture should reflect this. Fans/spectators can receive public health benefits, while tournament organisers/sponsors may realise revenue and corporate and social responsibility benefits. With two-thirds of participants indicating an interest to be more physically active, it may be an opportunity for intervention in a &#x02018;contemplative&#x02019; population. While the participants were largely already meeting the guidelines, it should be noted that this is a minimum level of PA and more is better, and that maintenance of PA is critical in adult and ageing populations.</p><p>Research priorities for the future include<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Assessing what methods for providing PA information/intervention (eg, big screen, leaflet, poster, email, direct conversation) are welcomed by spectators.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Investigating whether the spectating experience could be used as a teachable moment to raise awareness of personal PA behaviour, national guidelines and the benefits of PA and influence behavioural change.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Further study of spectator PA levels in different contexts, and with a larger and more representative sample, which may allow a better estimation of accrued PA, and potential gender and age differences.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Using qualitative methods to undertake an in-depth exploration of why exercise/PA is valued or not valued by spectators, and exploring the barriers to and facilitators of active spectating at professional golf tournaments among senior tournament decision makers.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Studying opportunities for other sports/events to explore spectator PA.</p></list-item></list>
</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This study was conducted with a pragmatic design and approach.</p><p>Strengths include a novel approach in raising awareness of PA through sport and demonstrating public health benefits of sporting events that have thus far been elusive. It also demonstrated the feasibility of conducting research with spectators at professional sporting events in collaboration with event organisers, governing bodies and athlete ambassadors. Research co-produced in this way may help implementation/scale up and assist impact and future intervention delivery in this manner. It is the first to objectively report PA accrued while spectating, while other findings are consistent with previous work describing spectator attitudes to exercise/PA.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;17</xref>
</p><p>A number of limitations are evident. Although approximately 600 spectators were approached, those who agreed to wear a pedometer and take part in the study may be more interested in PA and be more physically active than those who declined leading to a selection bias. Observed results may be susceptible to bias; individuals may have modified their responses and behaviours (for example walked more or less) based on what they believe is socially desirable and awareness of their behaviours being observed (Hawthorne effect). Twenty individuals had conclusive proof of pedometer error (for example from GPS/other pedometer), and their step counts were excluded. A smaller number of individuals expressed an opinion that the pedometer had underestimated their step count, but were included due to lack of objective evidence to support, which may have led to an underestimate of their and the observed population&#x02019;s step count. Step-count data were collected from entry to exit of venue, but did not capture participant PA during the other parts of their day. These limitations and sample size mandate caution in generalising to golf spectators more generally, particularly in different contexts.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Encouraging people to be more active more often is a public health imperative. A key element of generating increased PA in relation to a sporting event may be to de-emphasise participation in the sport itself and promote PA more generally. Evidence from this study showed that spectators&#x02019; rate &#x02018;exercise/physical activity&#x02019; as an important reason for attending the golf tournament and that spectating can provide HEPA.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Paths for All, the European Tour Golf, and 4sports for their input and collaboration at the Paul Lawrie Matchplay tournament.

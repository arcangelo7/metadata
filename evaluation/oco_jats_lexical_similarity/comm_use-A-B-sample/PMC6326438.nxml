patients, being a significant cause of delays and costs for health institutions, mainly
due to the perceived risk of hematogenous spread and surgical site infection (SSI) as it
leads to surgical reprogramming and antibiotic treatment<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. However, recent evidence has been showing that in most of the
scenarios ASB do not increase the risk of any infectious complications by itself, as in
the case of joint replacement<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. However,
in the cardiovascular surgery context there is few evidence about the impact of ASB in
the SSI rate, this last has a reported incidence of 1%-10% and confers affected
individuals a high risk of mortality, which can reach up to 25% in cases of deep
SSI<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. Because of this, there is a
substantial need of evaluating the potential role of ASB, in order to create optimal
recommendations for the SSI prevention in these patients. This systematic review and
meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the benefit of treating ASB prior to
cardiovascular surgery regarding the risk of SSI.</p><p>The present systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the
Cochrane Handbook for meta-analyses and systematic reviews and the PRISMA (Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) Statement. The literature
search was performed by two authors using the databases Medline, Embase, PubMed,
EBSCOHost, SciELO, LILACS and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials using
the following terms: asymptomatic bacteriuria; bacteriuria; nitrites; pyuria;
asymptomatic leukocyturia; urine analysis; urinalysis; cardiac surgery; heart surgery;
cardiovascular surgery; cardiothoracic surgery. Eligible studies corresponded to
randomized controlled trials, cohorts and case-control studies that evaluated the
benefit of treating ASB in patients taken to cardiovascular surgery. Also, the studies
included had to be written in in English, Spanish or Portuguese, published after January
1<sup>st</sup> of 1970 and had to be available on full text. The reviewers evaluated
the title at first, excluding those without any correlation with the objective of the
study, then the abstracts were reviewed, removing the duplicates, finally the suitable
articles were selected for full text review. For outcomes with suitable data for
combination, results were meta-analyzed using Review Manager 5.3 (Nordic Cochrane
Center, Cochrane Collaboration 2009, Copenhagen, Denmark).</p><p>After the initial search, 410 articles were identified, being 407 excluded for not being
related to the study's objective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). Three
studies involving a total of 1116 patients were included, being the individuals mainly
males (47.4%), with a mean age at the procedure of 67.4 years. The procedures performed
corresponded to non-valvular coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in 473 (42%)
patients, valvular replacements in 567 (51%) cases and thoracic aortic surgeries in 76
(7%) patients. Regarding the treatment, 116 patients had specific antimicrobial
treatment before the surgical procedure, having these patients a higher rate of SSI when
compared to the ones not treated (12.9% <italic>vs</italic>. 8.2%), however, this result
did not achieve a statistically significant value (<italic>P</italic>=0.086). To
compliment this finding, a random effects model meta-analysis was performed to evaluate
the benefit that treating bacteriuria may confer regarding SSI risk. A moderate
heterogeneity was observed (I<sub>2</sub>=64%) among the included studies, encountering
a not significant effect of the antimicrobial intervention over the infectious
complications chosen (OR 1.38; 95% CI 0.56, 3.38) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure
2</xref>).</p><p>

</p><p>As for other kind of surgical procedures, our meta-analysis results suggest that ASB
treatment may not influence the development of SSI in included types of cardiac and
cardiovascular surgeries, therefore active screening for this condition may not be
useful, as the only goal of identifying ASB in the clinical practice is to treat it. In
consequence, neither preoperative urine culture or ASB treatment could be recommended,
as they may represent an inappropriate use of resources without a clear benefit. On the
other hand, they may expose the patients to prolonged hospitalizations and unjustifiably
to antibiotics with multiple adverse effects, as allergic reactions, post antibiotic
diarrhea and resistance induction, also increasing health care costs<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Significant limitations appear when analyzing this study, as the very low number of
available studies and the retrospective and non-randomized design of the included ones
makes impossible to generate a strong recommendation, giving for now only a view of the
trend of the research performed in this area. Larger multicenter studies are needed for
establishing the role of asymptomatic urinary tract colonization in infectious
complications of surgical procedures as cardiovascular surgery.</p></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Nicolle</surname><given-names>LE</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Asymptomatic bacteriuria: when to screen and when to

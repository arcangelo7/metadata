Almost 600 of those diagnosed are children. Before the outbreak, some 1200 children were known to be living with HIV throughout Pakistan.</p><p>The outbreak was first reported on 25 April 2019. An HIV screening programme was initiated on 28 April, and was expanded on 8 May, with additional health workers being deployed. </p><p>On 16 May, local authorities established a new antiretroviral treatment clinic for children in Larkana. Early last month they were working to ensure supplies of antiretroviral drugs through global procurement processes, as they continued to screen patients and map the disease outbreak.</p><p>A team of experts from WHO Headquarters and the Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean arrived in Pakistan on 28 May, at the request of the Ministry of Health, to support the response to the outbreak.

The outbreak continues to be contained within 12 active health zones in North Kivu and Ituri provinces.</p><p>One possible reason for the decline was an improved security situation, which was allowing response teams to implement key interventions including infection prevention and safe burial practices.</p><p>As of 6 June 2019, a total of 2025 cases had been reported and 1357 deaths, representing an overall case fatality ratio of 67%.

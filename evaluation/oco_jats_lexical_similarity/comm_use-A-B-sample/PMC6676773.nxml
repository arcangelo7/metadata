Core body temperature was monitored and maintained at 37&#x000b0;C for the duration of the surgery by means of a rectal probe and feedback-controlled heating pad (Hugo Sachs, March-Hugstetten, Germany). Traumatic injury was performed using the CCI model, as described previously.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Animals were fixed in a stereotactic frame (Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA, USA) and a 4&#x000d7;5 mm craniotomy window was created using a saline-cooled, high-speed drill along the coronal and lambdoid sutures and laterally as close as possible to the temporalis muscle insertion. The bone flap was lifted exposing the dura above the right parietal cortex, between the sagittal, lambdoid, and coronal sutures. The tip of a custom-built CCI device (L. Kopacz, Mainz, Germany) was positioned above the intact dura in the centre of the craniotomy window (1 mm from sagittal suture and 1 mm from lambdoid suture). The angle of the impactor, typically 25&#x000b0; from the sagittal plane, was adjusted such that the tip was perpendicular to the dural surface. The impactor tip was flat, with a diameter of 3 mm, impact velocity of 8 m s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, impact duration of 150 ms, and penetration depth of 1.0 mm. Our CCI impact parameters and the functional and histological outcomes are similar to those classified as a moderate&#x02013;severe injury.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> After CCI surgery, the craniotomy was closed with the bone flap, sealed with tissue glue (Histoacryl; Braun-Melsungen, Melsungen, Germany), and the skin sutured. Sham-surgery animals underwent identical anaesthesia, temperature control, placement in stereotaxic frame, surgical skin incision to reveal the surface of the skull, which was drilled superficially, but no craniotomy was performed. The duration of the sham surgery and anaesthesia was identical to that of the CCI animals. In order to avoid any confounding effects from the anaesthesia and analgesia we were careful to ensure that the sham group received exactly the same drugs. The choice of anaesthetic and analgesic drugs in animal TBI studies may also have an impact on how secondary injury develops. For our study we chose to combine sevoflurane and buprenorphine. Sevoflurane has been shown to have minimal effects on secondary injury development in TBI models.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Buprenorphine is a highly effective and safe analgesic in rodents.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Despite some controversy surrounding opioid effects on TBI outcomes in rodents,<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> evidence is limited.

The test measures hippocampus-dependent contextual place memory. For the 2 week and 20 month tests, entirely different contexts (chambers) were used in order to test memory of novel environments. These tests were carried out by another blinded observer. For context conditioning training, an animal was placed inside a conditioning context Plexiglas chamber (36&#x000d7;20&#x000d7;20 cm) with a removable shock grid made of stainless steel rods (4 mm in diameter, spaced 6 mm apart). After 2 min, animals received a first electrical shock (0.4 mA, 2 s) and 15 s later a second shock with the same characteristics. Animal behaviour was recorded by a video camera to monitor freezing behaviour, defined as the lack of movement (excluding respiratory movements). The analysis of the freezing behaviour was performed using computerised video software (EthovisionXT software; Noldus Information Technology, Wageningen, The Netherlands). The contextual memory test was performed 24 h after context conditioning training. Mice were monitored for freezing for 2&#x000a0;min in the same context chamber that was used for training. The cumulative duration (s) of freezing behaviour during the 2&#x000a0;min of testing was used.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.4.3"><title>Survival analysis</title><p id="p0080">The long-term survival cohort was kept for 20 months after CCI surgery to assess survival.

Remarkably, this late-onset cognitive impairment was absent in the TBI xenon group. The contextual fear conditioning paradigm we used is robust and one of the most comprehensively characterised rodent models of learning and memory. This test allowed us to use novel visuospatial contexts for the two time points and is not confounded by motor deficits. Although memory is a cognitive function, it is only one component of global cognition that can be assessed in patients. Nevertheless, our findings are of particular clinical relevance because of the association of TBI with increased risk of AD and other neurodegenerative conditions in which delayed onset memory impairment is observed.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Our results suggest that xenon treatment may prevent development of these persistent cognitive deficits in TBI patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.4"><title>Histopathological correlates of late-onset cognitive impairment are reduced by xenon</title><p id="p0185">Long-term loss of cerebral white matter after TBI is associated with cognitive impairment in patients.

In addition to reducing reactive astrogliosis in the contralateral corpus callosum, xenon treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the thickness of astrocytic scarring bordering the lesion cavity in the retrosplenial and somatosensory cortex.

We observed increases in number of microglia in the right amygdala in the TBI control group but not in the xenon-treated group. The amygdala is involved in memory recall involving anxiety and fear responses, and this observation may play a role in xenon preventing long-term cognitive impairment. Our findings suggest that the learning and memory deficits developing late after the injury result from a combination of discrete injury, involving key brain areas such as CA1 and DG regions of the hippocampus, the hypothalamus, retrosplenial cortex, and amygdala, and reduction of connectivity resulting from loss of white matter. Overall, xenon treatment preserved neuronal white matter, and reduced neuronal loss in the hippocampal CA1 and DG regions, and this may explain how xenon treatment prevents the late-onset cognitive impairment.

Early deaths (6 months after injury) were observed in the TBI control group but not in any other group, which we attribute to an increased risk of death resulting from the TBI. Xenon treatment improved survival significantly in the first 12 months after injury. Interestingly, no animals in the TBI xenon group or the sham group died in the first 12 months.

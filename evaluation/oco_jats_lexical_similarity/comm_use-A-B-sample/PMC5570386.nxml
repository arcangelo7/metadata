valve degeneration, aortic aneurysms and dissections, as well as mechanical
circulatory assistant devices have been performed through minimally invasive
procedures in an ever so growing manner. Since the first case of transcatheter
aortic valve implantation (TAVI) performed by Doctor Allan Cribier, in
2002<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>, the number of
patients who receive catheterbased heart valves and aortic endografts has been
growing exponentially.</p><p>Regarding structural heart diseases, transcatheter aortic valve implantation is
undisputedly the main example of this type of approach. With more than 100.000
procedures worldwide, it has been established as the main option for the treatment
of symptomatic aortic stenosis in inoperable and high risk patients<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>, with newer studies trying to push this indication towards
moderate risk patients, such as the PARTNER 2 Trial<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>TAVI can be performed through various access routes, and while transfemoral approach
is the most common, other options are widely available and performed according to
each center's expertise, such as transaxillary/subclavian, transaortic,
transcarotid, and the main option, transapical approach<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. Although
both transfemoral and transapical techniques are well established as viable access
routes for TAVI and other endovascular procedures such as valve-in-valve implants,
each one presents its difficulties, peculiarities and complications, making it
difficult so far to establish the superiority of one over the other, when both
options are feasible<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The transfemoral approach is considered to be less invasive, performed through a
puncture of the common femoral artery, ideally at its bifurcation point and, due to
recently available assistant closure devices, this technique can be performed in a
totally percutaneous manner. On the other hand, the transapical approach guarantees
an easier access to the aortic and mitral valves, as well as the ascending aorta, in
a way that the catheters are less introduced and have to travel a much smaller
distance, which makes it easier to manipulate and position them. However, this
approach requires a thoracotomy, general anesthesia and the placement of sutures at
the apex of the left ventricle, thus characterizing a more invasive procedure.
Furthermore, serious hemorrhage can occur due to the manipulation of the left
ventricle, be it during the procedure or postoperatively, which accounts for one of
the main concerns regarding this method.</p><p>Other advantages of the transapical approach are cited below<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>:</p><p>
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Presents no vascular caliber limitations and can be performed in patients
with inaccessible aorto-iliac systems, either as a consequence of severe
calcification or aneurysmal dilatations.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Smaller risk of micro-embolization by less trauma to the stenotic aortic
valve, when compared to the retrograde course.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Allows implant of the valve with no previous dilatation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Utilizes wider catheters, which translates in lesser need to crimp the
valve and therefore, less trauma to the prosthesis. This may increase
its durability throughout time.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The position of the prosthetic valve over the native valve is better
defined and easier to be implanted, since the angle of the catheter's
insertion is much more favorable.</p></list-item><list-item><p>In re-operations, the adhesion that is created between the left ventricle
and the pericardium, in the anterior chest wall, may facilitate the
procedure and reduce bleeding.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Although many studies show that the complication rate of apex closure are
low<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>, it is
undeniable that this is one of the main concerns of the Heart Team, especially due
to the risk of bleeding. For those experienced in this type of approach, the closure
of the left ventricle at the end of the procedure is one of the most delicate parts
of the operation. With this in mind, this new device named CorPoint was developed,
which aims to minimize the risk of bleeding at the same time as it eases the
insertion and manipulation of catheters during surgical procedure.</p><p>The device aids in transapical access by presenting the following
characteristics:</p><p>
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Fast and direct access to the heart and its chambers.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Access to the ascending and descending aorta from the apex of the left
ventricle.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Direct access to the left sided heart valves.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Spares the need to suture the heart at the end of the procedure, since a
closing capsule is screwed over the base of the device to stop the
bleeding.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Reduces hemorrhage complications.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Reduces operative time.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The possibility of enabling this procedure to evolve into a totally
percutaneous approach.</p></list-item></list>
</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>The Device</title><p>CorPoint was developed in partnership with HELP Plastic S.A., and is produced
entirely of 316 stainless steel, a material largely applied in the medical field
since it does not present any adverse reactions to the human body.</p><p>It is composed basically of 3 parts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure
1</xref>):</p><p>
<fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>A) CorPoint assembled with the body as one. The base with the coiled
spring are apart. B) The device with each of its parts

</p><p>
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The body, which represents the introducing system</p></list-item><list-item><p>The base, with its coiled spring</p></list-item><list-item><p>The closing capsule.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>The whole device is assembled in one piece. The first step is to puncture the
apex of the left ventricle and introduce a guide wire, oriented through
fluoroscopy, until it reaches the descending aorta. The wire is then passed
inside the CorPoint introducing system and the device is directed towards the
heart, where the tip of the spring will touch its surface. The device is then
pressed against the beating heart and rotated clockwise, thus allowing the
spring to penetrate progressively into the myocardium, until its base reaches
the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). When in position,
the base will compress over the myocardium, in a sealed manner, and prevent any
type of bleeding.</p><p>
<fig id="f2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>On the left is the base, with its coiled spring and the closing
capsule that is screwed over its central opening; and on the right
the device is in place, with a valve introducer sheath being passed
through it.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-32-03-0156-g02"/></fig>
</p><p>The base is circular in shape and has a round opening in its center, through
where the catheters are inserted, as well as six small holes in its rim, where
sutures can be placed if any bleeding occurs and the surgeon judges that the
device needs to be more firmly fixed to the myocardium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>
<fig id="f3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>CorPoint implanted on the apex of the left ventricle. Sutures were
placed on the pericadium to ease exposure.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-32-03-0156-g03"/></fig>
</p><p>The catheters are passed through the body, connected to the base, which provides
great stability in regards to their positioning and manipulation. The body
possesses a valve mechanism that also prevents bleeding through the interior of
the system, especially when the valve insertion catheter is removed and a
considerably large perforation is formed in the left ventricle. At this point,
at the end of the procedure, the closing capsule is screwed over the central
opening of the base and the device is sealed tight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>). However, the closing capsule presents a small
orifice which allows the passage of the guide wire, thus the capsule can be
screwed over the base while the guide wire is still in place. This enables the
surgeon to remove the guide wire only at the very end of the procedure, which
guarantees a much safer and controlled environment.</p><p>
<fig id="f4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>At the end of the procedure, CorPoint is sealed and only the guide
wire remains, the last thing to be removed.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-32-03-0156-g04"/></fig>
</p></sec><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>We developed an experimental study in pigs where the main goal was to validate
our device as a viable, safe, fast and effective option for the transapical
access of the heart, in the treatment of structural heart diseases. Secondary
objectives were to evaluate the bleeding risk, the durability of the device
through a new access 30 days after its insertion, and the histopathological
alterations in the cardiac muscle related to the presence of the device.</p></sec><sec><title>Specimens</title><p>CorPoint was tested in a total of 15 pigs, with a medium weight of 60 kg, nine
males and six females. All animals were obtained from a certified farm, properly
qualified to provide specimens for scientific research.</p><p>Ten animals had the device implanted as an access route for the performance of
other endovascular procedures, such as: three TAVI; four procedures on the
mitral valve, with the deployment of transcatheter mitral valves and testing of
another device for mitral prolapse; and three implants of endovascular aortic
endografts on the thoracic descending aorta. All these animals were sacrificed
at the end of the procedure.</p><p>The other five animals had CorPoint embedded as their main surgical procedure.
Catheters and wires were passed through the device to simulate endovascular
procedures, but no endovascular prosthesis was deployed. These pigs were kept
alive for follow-up with the device fixed to their heart during one month, and
at the end of this period were once again operated to test reentry through the
same CorPoint that had been inserted previously. Finally, they were sacrificed,
their heart explanted and sent to histopathologic analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Implant of the device</title><p>The pigs were submitted to general anesthesia, orotracheal intubation, kept in
supine position with their anterior and posterior limbs extended. A small
anterolateral thoracotomy approximately 5 cm wide was performed in the fifth
intercostal space, dissection performed until the pericardium was reached and
incised, to expose the apex of the left ventricle, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p>The apex was punctured with a needle at a site not close to any coronary arteries
or branches, a hydrophilic guidewire inserted and steered with the aid of
fluoroscopy until it reached the descending aorta. Over the wire, a 7 Fr
catheter was introduced and the hydrophilic wire was replaced by an extra stiff
one, to serve as rail and guide the CorPoint introduction system to the surface
of the heart. Progressively thicker catheters were inserted, until the maximum
of 24 Fr, to simulate endovascular procedures on the heart valves and aorta, and
at the end they were withdrawn and the closing capsule screwed over the base,
sealing the device.</p></sec><sec><title>Reentry Assessment</title><p>After 30 days, the five animals were taken to the operating room, anesthetized,
and placed in the same position. An incision was made on the same spot and
CorPoint was easily identified after dissection. The closing capsule was removed
and the left ventricle was once again punctured through the central hole on the
base, so that catheters were inserted one more time to simulate procedures. The
capsule was screwed in place at the end, and, once no bleeding was observed, the
specimen was sacrificed and its heart removed for study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>CorPoint proved to be an excellent tool in the aid of transapical heart access, and
proved efficient in both first and redo operations. We were able to perform the
proposed operation in all ten animals that had CorPoint implanted as an access route
for another main procedure. In these cases, the advantages of the transapical access
with minimal blood loss were combined, and in none of the cases the need to place
any sutures through the myocardium was observed. Another advantage worth mentioning
was the easier manipulation of the heart tip, guaranteed by the body of the device,
which allowed for a much more stable handling and easier steering of the wires and
sheaths.</p><p>With regards to the other five pigs that had CorPoint embedded as their main
procedure, none experienced any adverse event during follow-up. All animals returned
to the farm where they were kept in specific and controlled conditions, daily
monitored and tended to by the team of veterinarians. They all gained normal weight
and presented no alterations to their regular behavior.</p><p>When submitted to the second surgical procedure one month after the first approach,
that is the reentry evaluation, all presented with expected adhesions typical of
reoperations. However, these adhesions were restricted to the apex and inferior
aspects of the heart. In all pigs, the same previous incision was used and oriented
the dissection towards the tip of the left ventricle, with the advantage that the
CorPoint was palpable and worked as a landmark to guide the dissection. The closing
capsule was easily removed and the left ventricle once again punctured through the
central orifice of the device.</p><p>Bleeding as a consequence of the insertion of CorPoint was negligible in all 15
cases, and the closing capsule guaranteed hemostasis in 100% of the specimens. The
placement of sutures on the myocardium was not necessary in any animal, since
CorPoint assured a bloodless field during and after the procedure. Although our
device offers six small holes circumferentially on the rim of the device to allow
sutures to fix it to the myocardium were proved unnecessary, the coiled spring
guaranteed adequate anchoring of the base to the heart surface.</p><p>The total amount of blood loss during the procedure was less than 50 ml in 86% of the
cases (13/15 specimens). In two animals, a slightly greater amount of bleeding was
noted, respectively 150 ml and 220 ml, due to a lesion to the internal thoracic
artery during thoracotomy and dissection, which was easily controlled after its
ligation.</p><p>All five hearts that had CorPoint embedded during one month were sent to
histopathological evaluation, after the pigs were euthanized, to assess the
structural alterations related to the presence of the device. Two regions were
analyzed in each heart: the tip, where the device was implanted, and the basal
portion of the inferior wall, far from the implant site, served as control. The area
related to CorPoint insertion showed regeneration tissue and fibrosis, both
restricted to the areas immediately adjacent to the spring, whereas the control
sites showed no alterations, except in one heart that revealed an epicardium
thickening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>). In two cases, an acute
inflammatory process related to the CorPoint insertion was found, which may be
related to an infection. In one of these cases a small amount of pus was found
during tissue dissection. In another heart, the pathologist observed a foreign body
reaction with chronic inflammation process. However, all these alterations were
limited to areas adjacent to the device, in a way that the muscular tissue between
the spirals of the spring was considered normal.</p><p>
<fig id="f5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>A) Regeneration tissue and fibrosis found in the small area adjacent to
the device implant; B) Normal myocardium at the control site.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-32-03-0156-g05"/></fig>
</p><p>No evidence of thrombus formation on the inner surface of the left ventricle was
found, analyzed macro and microscopically. Likewise, no contractile dysfunction
related to the presence/ implant of the device was observed, analyzed
macroscopically by the surgeon performing the device implant and reentry.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Transapical approach of the heart has been shown as an excellent alternative in
minimally invasive procedures and high risk patients, who present with severe
cardiovascular diseases, older age and other systemic disorders
associated<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>. In this group, there are
patients with heart valve diseases, aortic aneurysms and dissections, congestive
heart failure and other infirmities, who will directly benefit from the development
of a device that enables such approach in a safer manner, with less risk of
complications, bleeding, ventricular rupture and also facilitates posterior
interventions. CorPoint was able to match and exceed these expectations in this
animal based experimental study, and appears to be a helpful tool for the
transapical access of the heart. This becomes even more interesting when we consider
its potential application to transcatheter valve-in-valve procedures, frequently
performed through transapical access for the treatment of degenerated bioprosthetic
heart valves<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Regarding this kind of approach, the majority of studies and procedures described in
the literature are related to TAVI. However, until this moment there are no
available results for a prospective, randomized clinical trial, comparing
transapical <italic>versus</italic> transfemoral approach, regarding TAVI or any
other endovascular procedure. There are meta-analysis and multicentric
studies<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> that seem to show a greater 30 day mortality rate
related to transapical TAVI (TAAVI) when compared to transfemoral (TFAVI).
Nevertheless, these studies also demonstrate that patients submitted to TAAVI carry
higher STS and EuroSCORE II risks, which show that they have in fact more
comorbidities and higher operative risks. A German study<sup>[<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> revealed that the STS score was the best long
term mortality predictor, regardless of the access route, and that TAAVI, although
associated with a higher perioperative mortality, showed no influence on long term
prognosis. Other studies also show higher rates of vascular complications related to
transfemoral access, alongside with a higher risk of bleeding and blood
transfusion<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In any way, a discussion over the best access route for TAVI is not the focus of this
study. We wish only to present a tool that aspires to facilitate the transapical
access of the heart and, for the time being, is still in an experimental phase of
development, but with promising results. Greater studies are required before we can
begin to use this technology in human patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The transapical approach of the left ventricle and its complications are a worldwide
concern. Although there are other devices available on the international market that
target this exact problem, such as Apica, Permaseal, EnTourage and
CardiApex<sup>[<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup>; and many of these are already
being used in humans with good results, none are available outside Europe.</p><p>This is one of the main reasons that led us to develop our own transapical
ventricular access and closure device. This CorPoint prototype is the result of a
partnership between InCor FMUSP and HELP Plastic Ltda, a Brazilian company, and
counted with 100% national technology.</p><p>When our national epidemiology is analyzed, cardiovascular diseases appear as our
main cause of death and healthcare expenses (DATASUS 2012), aligned with our
population aging reality, we can conclude that the cardiovascular burden to society
tends only to increase. Therefore, the development of a device that will assist the
treatment of such diseases, minimizing risks, complications, and probably ultimately
costs, presents as an answer to an ever so growing healthcare demand.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="50%" span="1"/><col width="50%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">LP</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Substantial contributions to the conception or design

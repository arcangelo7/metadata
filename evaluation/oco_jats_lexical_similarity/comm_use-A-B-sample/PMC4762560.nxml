indicators is associated with better clinical outcomes<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. Standardized quality control programs are useful
to improve these indicators and have shown progressive importance in cardiovascular
surgery<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Society of
Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Database is a strong source of information for quality
programs, considering that this registry includes data from more than one thousand
hospitals in a wide range of indicators.</p><p>The STS Database separates the hospitals according to their performance in diverse
indicators delivering benchmarks for their participants. This tool has shown utility
for the development and evaluation of quality improvement (QI) programs<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. However, most of this evidence comes from studies in North
America and little is known in other regions. The value of this STS registry may not
be applicable in other countries outside of the United States of America. Since July
2011, a Brazilian hospital has joined the STS Database. The current report aims to
show the first three years of experience and the initial local changes on
quality-indicators through QI programs based on STS database reports.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Population analyzed</title><p>All consecutive patients submitted to isolated coronary artery bypass graft
surgeries (CABG) from July 2011 until June 2014 in a Brazilian private
cardiovascular hospital were analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>A multifaceted and continuous educational program based on STS reports was
implemented during the year of 2012 by a multidisciplinary team targeting three
indicators: 1) Time on mechanical ventilation (MV); 2) Length of stay (LOS) in
intensive care unit (ICU); 3) Evidence-based perioperative therapies in eligible
patients including the use of internal mammary artery in CABG. A local team
composed by physicians and nurses developed an institutional protocol for the
appropriate use of perioperative medications (including sedation during
perioperative period) and implemented a systematic assessment to the first 6
hours after surgery using objectives criteria for extubation. The QI team
trained physicians, nurses and physiotherapists to follow the institutional
protocol and also used the data from the best hospitals in STS report as
benchmark to show to the surgical and clinical staff that the targets were
feasible. A case manager nurse was responsible to prospectively collect the data
from each patient, enter the data in the institutional database and STS
database, and also to check the indicators, making interventions with the team
in case of non-adherence to hospital goals.</p></sec><sec><title>Choice of target endpoint</title><p>The hospital has joined STS Database in July 2011 and the first reports were
provided in the end of 2011 and beginning of 2012. The three targeted endpoints
described above in the intervention section have been chosen through
multidisciplinary meetings including clinicians, surgeons, nurses, intensive
care staff, anesthesiologist and physiotherapists identified local priorities
according to the team interpretation of these reports. Reintubation and
readmission to ICU were also monitored to evaluate safety of early extubation
and discharge.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary endpoints</title><p>STS Database quarterly reports each Hospital's performance in the domains of

chance of type I error (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) in two-tailed tests.
Continuous variables were presented as means and standard deviation for cases
that proximity could be determined with a normal distribution. The Student's
<italic>t</italic> test was used to compare means. The Wilcoxon and
Mann-Whitney tests were applied to other continuous variables; presented by
means and interquartile ranges (25<sup>th</sup> and 75<sup>th</sup> percentile).
Data related with categorical variables were analyzed using the chi-squared test
or the Fisher exact test when necessary. The two target endpoints that may be
influenced by prognostic factors (time on MV and LOS in ICU) were also included
in a logistic regression multivariate analysis to evaluate the independent
association of these indicators with the period of the program (2011/2012
<italic>vs.</italic> 2013/2014). The following covariates were included in
this analysis: age, gender, hematocrit, creatinine (pre and post), cross-clamp
and perfusion times, comorbidities, STS risk. Statistical calculations were done
using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences program (SPSS, Chicago, IL,
USA) version 20.0.</p><p>For analysis of quality domains in CABG procedures, statistical significance is
based on a 99% Bayesian certainty criterion. The Bayesian credible interval
shows the range in which the participant's true proportion (or risk-adjusted
proportion) is likely to lie. A participant receives 3 stars if there is at
least 99% Bayesian probability that the participant's score exceeds the STS mean
score. A participant receives one star if there is at least 99% Bayesian
probability that the participant's score is less than the STS mean score.
Otherwise, the participant receives 2 stars. The rates for the mortality and
morbidity domain are adjusted to the risk of the patients in each hospital to
avoid confounders.</p><p>The current analysis followed the ethical aspects described in the Declaration of
Helsinki and the Document of the Americas. Our study was approved by the

program population, they had similar mean age (61.8 <italic>vs.</italic> 60.3

to CABG pre-QI (26.4% <italic>vs.</italic> 16.8% <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01).
Despite baseline differences in specific items such as gender, a validated
multivariate model (STS score), showed that the predicted risk of In-hospital
mortality during the period analyzed was 0.75% in 2011, 1.1% in 2012, 0.75% in 2013
and 0.7% in 2014 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05). As exposed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 2</xref>, there was a reduction in the time on MV, in the
postoperative LOS and also improvement in the use evidence-based perioperative
medications. The improvement in the use of internal mammary artery was not
statistically significant. The rates of reintubation and readmission were not
different in both groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 2</xref>). Using a
risk-adjusted model (STS score), the reduction in LOS and in the time on MV were
associated with more patients discharged with less than 6 days but the difference of
prolonged MV (&#x0003e; 24 hours) was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 2</xref>). A multivariate analysis showed that
controlling for prognostic factors the chance of staying &#x0003e; 48 hours in ICU was
higher in 2011/2012 when compared to 2013/2014 (OR=1.45; CI 95% 1.06-1.86;

registry as STS Database as a benchmark to guide QI programs in a Brazilian Hospital
was associated with improvement in target quality-indicators. There was a reduction
in all the three endpoints targeted. Reintubation and readmission did not increase
with an earlier extubation and discharge.</p><p>The main goals for the years of 2013 and 2014 were defined by the local group after
evaluation of the first STS Database reports. Considering that time on MV, LOS in
ICU and use of appropriate therapy cannot be modified by a single intervention, a
multifaceted program was necessary to achieve reduction in these indicators.</p><p>The use of the own hospital database for QI is a common practice in many services,
including Brazilian Hospitals<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>
but the use of multicenter registries for continuous QI programs as STS Database had
not been available until recently in Brazil despite their use for years in such
countries as the United States<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. This tool for evaluation of
medical performance was developed to assess relevant evidence-based indicators
adjusted to the risk of the patients. The innovation of the present report is that
despite cultural barriers and demographic diversity among patients and
professionals, this tool showed a very promising application in a new country.
Similar to the majority of QI programs implemented in clinical practice, the
multifaceted QI program reported was not developed primarily for research purposes
but aimed mainly improvement in local indicators along the time in a real world
scenario. The difference of the reported QI program is that it was based on
quarterly reports of an international database including a Brazilian hospital.</p><p>The comparison with different hospitals was extremely useful to identify the most
important discrepancies that need to be addressed. However, analysis of outcomes
measurements (e.g. mortality, cerebrovascular accident) in this kind of registry
should be evaluated carefully because differences in these results may be related to
the risk of the patient and not the quality of care. Even considering that STS
reports provide the results adjusted to the risks, we made a local validation of
these models<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> to be more
confident when comparing the results of the hospitals. The current report did not
target mortality endpoint which, in our point of view, probably will need more time,
more patients and more QI programs to change along the time.</p><p>The only targeted item that did not show a statistically significant improvement
after the QI program was the use of internal mammary artery. This finding is
probably related to the fact that the baseline performance was very close to the
target and it would need a large number of patients to show significant difference.
Despite the absolute 8% improvement in the use of evidence-based medications, a gap
of 5% still remained. This gap is almost entirely related to preoperative beta
blockade therapy, which remain an area of debate regarding the benefit of its
routine use in the preoperative period of CABG<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. Thereby, not only the educational intervention but also
the strength of the evidence is important to change behavior and improve quality
indicators.</p><p>The lack of a randomized control group makes the current analysis of endpoints
vulnerable to confusion factors. Multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate if
the period after the QI program was associated with improvement in the target
indicators independently of other prognosis covariates. In addition, prognosis
differences are more important in comparisons of clinical outcomes, which was not
the main objective of this analysis that targeted indicators related to the process
of care. Regarding the use of evidence-based therapy in eligible patients this
indicator is not influenced by prognostic factors and multivariate analysis was not
considered necessary, especially because the groups compared had similar prognosis
characteristics along the years using STS model for in-hospital mortality. Also,
these patients were treated in the same service and by the same medical team, and
this report intends to represent a real-world utilization of the STS Database.</p><p>Other aspect to be considered is that the interventions were specific to three
indicators and that this is a single center experience. This concept should be
evaluated in more hospitals and different clinical scenarios to confirm the
applicability of this tool for a broader use in Brazilian cardiovascular
centers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The initial experience with STS registry in a Brazilian hospital was associated with

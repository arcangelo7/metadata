Burn injury may be distinguished as a kind of inflammation beneath the stratum corneum of the skin, which can either progress to extemporary healing or can deteriorate to further necrosis, contingent on the approach to treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Thermal burn injury tends to be the most common devastating trauma that emanates in either disability or death of burn patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Reactive oxygen species have been implicated in thermal burns that contribute to lipid peroxidation and other inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In contempt of the exploration of immense antiseptics, healing of burn wound still remains a challenge to modern medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Current treatment strategies usually rely on topical application of the medicament with an aim to intensify wound healing, minimize inflammatory response, and most importantly halt the opportunistic infections that are commonly associated with severe wound injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The most extensively used topical agent for burn injury includes silver sulfadiazine (SSD) 1&#x000a0;% cream, probably owing to its antimicrobial efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Regardless of this, the most significant clinical adverse effect of silver topical agent is the delayed wound healing along with other delineated adverse reactions such as resistance to silver sulfadiazine, renal toxicity, and leucopenia, therefore confirming that it should not be used on extensive wounds for extended periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p><italic>Morus alba</italic> L.

Isoquercetin being superior in concentration is the main anti-oxidant component of <italic>M. alba</italic> leaves that have been reported to manifest myriad of activities such as anti-inflammatory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], anti-oxidant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], antimicrobial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], reducing lipid peroxidation both in vivo and in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], anti-diabetic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], cytotoxic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and anti-hyperuricemic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Despite the established anti-oxidant property of isoquercetin through diverse research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], the potential of isoquercitrin in burn injury is not yet scrutinized.

Burn injury has been proclaimed in the medical literature to provoke the formation and release of oxidative free radicals and other pro-inflammatory mediators that mainly contribute to lipid peroxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The elevated lipid peroxidation level has been evident from the thiobarbituric acid reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Thus, it may be suggested that the restoration of circulating volume by aggressive fluid resuscitation as well as the compensation of the loss of endogenous scavenging mechanisms may collectively produce significant oxidative stress. Many plants and their derivatives have demonstrated their proficiency as anti-oxidants in scavenging as well as curbing the release of the reactive oxygen species from the ethno-pharmacological perspective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The <italic>M. alba</italic> leaf extract has been investigated for its anti-oxidant property using various methods like the iron (III)-reducing capacity, the total anti-oxidant capacity, the DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging activity, and an in vitro inhibition of ferrous sulfate-induced oxidation of lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Isoquercetin being the main component of <italic>M. alba</italic> leaf was evaluated for its potential in healing the scald burns.</p><p>The burn wound recovery was assessed in terms of percentage of wound contraction and development of epithelial layer (period of epithelialization) after the eschar fell from the wound. A significant increase in the percentage of wound contraction in isoquercetin cream-treated group indicates the potent healing effect exerted by isoquercetin as compared to the control group. Furthermore, the dermal recovery of the tissue was also demonstrated in the wound as there was a highly significant decrease in the period of epithelialization in isoquercetin cream-treated group. Furthermore, it was interesting to observe that the decrease in the period of epithelialization in isoquercetin cream-treated group was more marked than that of silver sulfadiazine (standard)-treated group.</p><p>Moreover, the isoquercetin cream-treated groups exhibited a prominent decrease in the burn wound tissue TBARS levels and a significant rise in GSH levels in comparison with the burn injury group. An increase in the tissue TBARS levels is a clear indicator of an increase in the number of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the burn wound tissue. Furthermore, a decrease in the GSH levels in the burn wound tissue points towards a progressive decrease in the anti-oxidant capacity of the skin tissue under the influence of burn injury.</p><p>The histopathological study of the burn wound tissue clearly demonstrated the improvement in the tissue necrosis and associated inflammatory changes in different concentrations of isoquercetin-based cream-treated groups. However, significant injury repair and regeneration of epithelium was evident in the 0.06&#x000a0;%&#x02009;<italic>w</italic>/<italic>v</italic> isoquercetin-based cream-treated group as compared to the burn injury group and other groups as well indicating that higher concentrations of isoquercetin are capable of reversing the burn injury-induced morphological and biochemical as well as micro-vascular changes implicated in necrosis.</p><p>The results indicate the potential of isoquercetin in halting and to a much extent reversing the pathological interplay of inflammatory mediators and associated pro-oxidative pathways at the site of burn injury. The observed actions could possibly be attributed to potent anti-oxidant effect showed by isoquercetin as evident by a significant decrease in the burn tissue TBARS levels in the isoquercetin cream-treated groups. However, as burn injury is always considered an acute dermatological insult representing a plethora of oxidative changes within a short span of time, therefore, isoquercetin-based formulation could be of immediate use in burn injury so as to suppress free radical production and oxidative stress as early as possible. As a phytoconstituent, isoquercetin is found in many plant species in different concentrations which indicates the phytochemical importance of this constituent in medicinal plants of higher order. We are of the opinion that in future isoquercetin could be favorably utilized by the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industry for the development of anti-burn injury formulations for possible use as supportive therapy to ongoing and prevalent burn management therapeutic regime.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We can conclude that in a burn wound model in rats, isoquercetin-based cream was found to shorten the healing process both histopathologically and statistically as compared to SSD and the control group. Through its evident anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, isoquercetin can be used as an adjunctive or alternative agent to existing wound healing therapies in the future. However, wound tissue healing is a multi-factorial process involving a plethora of enzymes, receptors, and sub-molecular events. Therefore, further research is needed for highlighting the role of these processes and on the molecular mechanism of observed action of isoquercetin.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>NB was involved in conceptualization and planning of the study.

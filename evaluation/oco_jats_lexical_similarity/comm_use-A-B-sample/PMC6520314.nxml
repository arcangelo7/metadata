In most drugs, the stability of a medicinal product as a whole depends not only on the properties of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), but also on the formulation and/or method of manufacture. One of the most important concepts in drug design is understanding the intrinsic stability of the API molecule and its degradation pathways. The most frequently encountered mechanism of drug degradation is hydrolysis, oxidation, and to some extent, photolysis (1). However, in multi-component heterogeneous systems, the degradation of the API can be more complex and may be the result of more than one factor&#x000a0;&#x02013; for example, hydrolysis with further oxidation, or <italic>vice versa</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It can be also possible that interactions between API molecules and excipients may be non-specific and thus less understandable. For that reason, drug stability is a constant interest of many research teams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">Both of hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) are water-soluble derivatives of cellulose. They show a semi-crystalline structure, with a high degree of amorphous content and high molecular mobility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These polysaccharides are nontoxic and biocompatible with human tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Because their physical and chemical properties are simple to modify by synthesis, they are common dietary ingredients, can be used in surgical applications, and are one of the most important hydrophilic carrier materials used for the formulation of oral controlled drug delivery systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The characteristic feature of these polymers is their ability to form solutions with various viscosity that depends on the size and the conformation of the polymer.</p><p id="Par4">Interactions between water molecules and various carbohydrate polymers strongly modify both the properties of water itself and spatial structures of the polymer. Diversity of water behavior can be associated with capillary condensation effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], presence of &#x0201c;nanocavities&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], that are able to trap water clusters, or strong interactions with polar groups of the polymer. Such interactions may be the result of direct binding to a chain (hydrogen bonding) or <italic>via</italic> another water molecule. The system of water and cellulose chains can be associated with the presence of two distinct fractions of water: bound water BW and free water FW. Additionally, bound water can be subcategorized to non-freezing water NFW and freezing bound water FBW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The NFW is a fraction, where the first-order transitions, such as melting or freezing, are not calorimetrically observed. It does not crystallize even at &#x02212;&#x02009;100&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. For low concentrations, all water is considered to be non-freezing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, still, there are no experimental and/or theoretical confirmations that the amount of non-freezing water is quantitatively the same water that is associated with polymer chains. Water that is less closely associated with polymer chains and crystallizes at a temperature below 0&#x000b0;C is called freezing bound water. Compared to free water FW, which crystallizes at 0&#x000b0;C, the FBW fraction has a significantly smaller melting enthalpy.</p><p id="Par5">The aim of this work was to investigate the influence of viscosity as well as the non-freezing NFW water content on the stability of acetylsalicylic acid. Acetylsalicylic acid was chosen for these studies because it is the most commonly used hydrolyzable drug in a model of hygroscopic tablet formulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Due to a large variation of semi-synthetic celluloses in terms of both molecular weight and viscosity, hydroxypropyl celluloses (HPC), and hydroxypropyl methylcelluloses (HPMC) were used for further investigations. The amounts of strongly associated NFW water, in both of raw polysaccharides or their 1:1 (<italic>w/w</italic>) mixtures with acetylsalicylic acid, were investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) method that was previously applied by other authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. A decrease in the ASA content, accompanied by a proportional increase of salicylic acid (SA) content, was examined by means of UV-Vis spectrophotometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In summary, investigating the relationship between the content of non-freezing water and viscosity on the stability of API, may be crucial to better understanding the dissolution mechanisms and drug release of tablet formulations. The studied relationships have not been the subject to publication so far.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>EXPERIMENTAL</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par6">The hydroxypropylmethylcelluloses (HPMC) of substitution type 2910 (Methocel E3 LV) and 2208 (Methocel K100&#x000a0;M), of viscosity 3&#x000a0;mPa&#x000a0;s and 100,000&#x000a0;mPa&#x000a0;s respectively, were provided by Dow Chemical (Michigan, USA).

In the HPC group, where viscosity differed by one order of magnitude, the ASA contents at the end of the experiment were comparable and calculated to 85.95% and 85.05% for HPC/MF and HPC/LF respectively. However, for the HPMC/ASA mixtures, the viscosity differed by five orders of magnitude, and ASA contents were calculated to 93.7% for 100,000&#x000a0;cP and 89.0% for 3&#x000a0;cP. This gives a difference of 4.7% compared to 0.9% found in the HPC group. On the other hand, one can see that within the group with the same spatial architecture (HPC or HPMC), the level of hydrolysis increases with decreasing viscosity (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">IV</xref>).</p><p id="Par28">A similar relationship (variability within the group with the same spatial architecture) was observed by comparing the content of unhydrolyzed ASA to the NFW water contents (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">IV</xref>). It can be noticed, that with increasing NFW, the concentration of ASA that was not hydrolyzed is also increasing. In other words, the higher the NFW content, the greater the stability of acetylsalicylic acid within both HPC and HMPC group of mixtures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p id="Par29">In this study, we examined the influence of viscosity and contents of non-freezing water on the stability of acetylsalicylic acid as a model moisture sensitive ingredient.</p><p id="Par30">In the first part of the study, NFW contents were determined by differential scanning calorimetry. It was found that for both HPC and HPMC mixtures, the content of NFW increases with increasing viscosity, regardless of the chemical structure of polysaccharide.</p><p id="Par31">The next part of the research consisted of determining the degree of hydrolytic degradation of ASA. This time, the influence of the chemical structure of the studied polymers appeared. In the group of HPC matrices, the viscosity differed by one order of magnitude between studied polymers. The ASA contents after 35&#x000a0;days were comparable and equal to about 85% of the initial amount in the sample, although NFW content was found to be slightly different. In the HPMC group, the viscosity values differed by five orders of magnitude between studied polymers. For those systems, the ASA hydrolysis was significantly lower. The highest content of ASA was found for the high-viscosity and the high NFW content matrix and was equal to 93.7%.</p><p id="Par32">In summary, very high-viscosity HPMC formulations, which have a strong ability to bind water to the hydroxyl groups of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose chains (high NFW value), significantly reduce the contribution of moisture to hydrolysis reactions. Generally, less viscous systems increase the hydrolysis reaction rate, although the effect of NFW cannot be observed for HPC/MF and HPC/LF mixtures.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional

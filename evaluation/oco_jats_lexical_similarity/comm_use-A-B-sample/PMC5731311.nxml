46% of deaths from noncommunicable diseases in the world, which means that 7.4
million people die of a coronary event<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In Colombia, according to the National Health Institute, 56.3% of deaths in the
cardiovascular disease group were due to coronary heart disease, this figure being
higher that the cumulative figure reported by the WHO<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>However, the biggest concern for governments and healthcare services relates to the
millions of people who survive a coronary event and who are in need of specific
treatment for the disease, secondary prevention, and rehabilitation<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Multiple factors have been described, including genetics, the environment, life style
and even geography as influencing coronary artery disease<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. The disease consists of atheroma plaques that line
the length and bifurcations of the proximal and distal branches of coronary
circulation. This creates an imbalance in oxygen supply which results in a process
of ischemia, injury and, finally, infarction and death of the myocardial fibres when
sufficient oxygen supply cannot be restored<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>One of the interventions for treating coronary heart disease is coronary artery
bypass surgery (CABG)<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. This
operation has been shown to produce excellent results in terms of mortality, with a
10-year survival of 80%, making it a safe procedure<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Although this operation - performed with growing frequency due to the logarithmic
increase in the number of cases of coronary heart disease - has been shown to be
safe, the frequency of complications may be as high as 13%, meaning that 13 out of
100 patients undergoing this procedure may experience at least one complication
postoperatively<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Multiple patient-related and/or procedure-related factors have been reported in the
literature as affecting the onset of complications and mortality during the
postoperative period<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Moreover, differences have been shown between patients with and without metabolic
diseases in terms of mortality and complications following CABG, with an association
between the presence of those diseases and a higher frequency of
complications<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>One of the patient-related factors is the presence of hypothyroidism before CABG.
Although the association between the presence of coronary heart disease and thyroid
dysfunction is well known, it is not clear yet whether that dysfunction may have an
impact postoperatively<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Although figures on the hypothyroid population are not well known, there are reports
showing a higher frequency of coronary heart disease in patients with metabolic
diseases such as diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>No studies has yet been published in Colombia or Latin America about the impact of
hypothyroidism on surgical procedures. There are only a few reports in other cardiac
surgery centres in the world showing the same differential impact of hypothyroidism
in terms of mortality and morbidity following cardiac surgery<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The objective of this study was to determine the association between a preoperative
diagnosis of hypothyroidism and the presence of the composite and disaggregated
outcome of mortality and complications (atrial fibrillation, surgical site
infection, reoperation due to bleeding) in patients undergoing first-time myocardial
revascularization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Study Design and Population</title><p>Retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing firsttime isolated CABG.
Exposed patients were those who met at least one of the following criteria: a) a
history of pre-operative hypothyroidism, b) a diagnosis made during the
preoperative clinical history, c) a quantitative elevation of the thyroid
stimulating hormone (TSH) found up to seven days before the surgical procedure.
Non-exposed patients were those who did not meet any of the three criteria
listed above. The end-points of the study were: composite and disaggregated
outcome of inhospital mortality and complications (atrial fibrillation, surgical
site infection and reoperation due to bleeding).</p><p>Eligibility criteria: Exclusion criteria were patients taken to emergent surgery;
patients who had died in the operating room or within the first 24 hours after
surgery; patients with hybrid surgery and/or minimally invasive surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample Size and Sampling</title><p>Sample size was estimated using the Sample Size software version 1.1 and using
the arcsine method for estimating two proportions for cohort studies with the
following parameters: Type I error, 0.05; Type II error, 0.2; group-control
proportion, 0.12; rate of assignment between the groups, 1:1; type of
estimation, 2 tails; parameter for the exposed group, relative risk 2; total
number of patients in the exposed group, 314; total number of patients in the
non-exposed group, 314. The systematic nonprobabilistic sampling of all the
patients undergoing CABG at the cardiovascular surgery service between January
2008 and December 2014 was designed to identify exposed patients. A random
sampling was used for non-exposed patients, using the order of the date of
surgery as the systematic criterion during the same study period.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>A data audit was conducted in order to look for outliers, missing values,
mismatches or error data. The audit was based on a random selection of 10% of
the total number of patients included, and each of the variables was verified
against the clinical record. The overall audit error was 0.7%, resulting in the
approval of the information.</p><p>A univariate exploratory data analysis was conducted as follows: after using the
Shapiro-Wilk test to verify distribution type, quantitative variables were
expressed as the mean plus standard deviation for variables with normal
distribution, and as median plus inter-quartile range for variables without a
normal distribution. Qualitative variables were expressed in absolute and
relative frequencies. A comparative analysis of the exposed group (hypothyroid
patients) <italic>versus</italic> the non-exposed group (non-hypothyroid
patients) was conducted in order to look for differences among preoperative,
intraoperative and postoperative variables.</p><p>Quantitative variables with normal distribution were compared using Student's T
test, and variables with a non-parametric distribution were compared using the
Mann - Whitney test. Qualitative variables were compared using the Chi square
test.</p><p>A bivariate analysis was performed to determine individual variable association
with the composite and disaggregated outcome of in-hospital deaths and
complications (atrial fibrillation, surgical site infection and reoperation due
to bleeding). Independent variables were entered in the logistic regression
model when the <italic>P</italic> value was lower than 0.2 at that point of the
analysis. A logistic regression model was applied to determine the association
between hypothyroidism and the outcomes, adjusted for preoperative and
intraoperative variables.</p><p>An evaluation of the confounding variables of sex, age and use of cardiopulmonary
bypass circulation (CPB) was performed. No significant or clinically relevant
interactions were observed. The stepwise strategy was used, starting with the
complete model. Regression diagnoses were performed and the quality of the model
was evaluated once each variable was eliminated, using the R<sup>2</sup>, Akaike
and Bayesian criteria, and ending with the Hosmer and Lemeshow test.</p><p>The results of the associations were expressed in relative risks with their
respective 95% confidence intervals. The statistical tests were considered
significant, with a <italic>P</italic> value of less than 0.05. The analyses
were carried out using the STAT 13.0 software package.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical Considerations</title><p>The study was conducted in accordance with the principles set forth in the
18<sup>th</sup> World Medical Assembly (Helsinki, 1964) and its subsequent
amendments, and with Resolution 8430 of 1993 of the Colombian Ministry of
Health. According to Article 11 of the latter regulation, this research was
considered free of risk. Respect for the dignity of the individuals and
protection of the patient's privacy and confidentiality rights prevailed
throughout the different phases of the study.</p><p>The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Research Committee and by the
Ethics Committee of Fundacion Cardioinfantil - Instituto de Cardiolog&#x000ed;a.
The research was conducted by professionals in training under the supervision of
competent professionals with knowledge and experience to ensure the privacy and
quality of patient information. The information was used purely for academic
purposes and the confidentiality will be preserved.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>During the study period, 2049 first-time isolated myocardial revascularization

opportunity to generate new knowledge designed to comprehend and attempt to reduce
the burden of the disease, in this case of chronic non-communicable diseases.</p><p>The assessment and understanding of the comorbidities of the aging population
affected by cardiovascular events are the basis for planning primary and secondary
prevention strategies, improving patient care and rehabilitation, and ensuring that
medical, interventional and/or surgical treatments yield the maximum expected
benefits<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>This study evaluated the impact of preoperative hypothyroidism on the outcomes of
CABG in terms of mortality and morbidity. The objective was to determine whether the
presence of this metabolic comorbidity increased the occurrence of death and
complications, as has been observed in patients with metabolic syndrome and
diabetes<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The patients in the study were similar to those reported in the American registries
of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) and in European, Asian and Japanese
studies, with similar ages and prevalence of comorbidities such as hypertension,
diabetes and dyslipidemia<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The overall prevalence of hypothyroidism in this study was higher than that reported
by Zindrou et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> and Park et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> at a range between
0.5-11%, adjusted by sex. This may be explained on the basis of the preoperative
assessment protocols, because the use of a systematic assessment may improve
detection and diagnosis of patients with hypothyroidism, as is the case in our own
institution.</p><p>Hypothyroid patients were older than the controls and there were more women with this
diagnosis. These findings are similar to those reported by Zindrou et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>, Park et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>, and Ning et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>, and they may be associated with
the fact that this metabolic disease is more frequent in females and, moreover, the
onset of coronary heart disease tends to occur later in women due to the protective
effect of oestrogens<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>No important differences was found in terms of other comorbidities between
hypothyroid and non-hypothyroid patients. As suggested by Zindrou et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> and Park et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>, this metabolic disease does not
determine the onset of other diseases, unlike what has been observed in diabetes and
heart failure<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>No differences was found either in terms of the surgical characteristics between the
groups, showing that the technical conditions of the procedure were not impacted by
the presence of this diagnosis in this cohort of patients. The results of the
operative characteristics are comparable to those reported in American
series<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The mortality observed in the original cohort of the patients selected for study, and
the mortality in hypothyroid patients is similar to the mortality reported in the
STS and the European registries<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Although mortality in hypothyroid patients is higher than in non-exposed patients, it
is not significantly different from that observed by Park et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. However, it is in contrast to what
has been observed for other cardiovascular procedures<sup>[<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>-<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The incidence of complications such as atrial fibrillation, reoperation due to
bleeding and surgical site infection in the cohort is similar to what has been
reported in American and European series<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>. There was a
difference between the groups only for the postoperative atrial fibrillation
outcome, but this finding has not been observed in prior studies<sup>[<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>This study showed a risk association between hypothyroidism and the onset of atrial
fibrillation as comorbidity-adjusted independent factor. Comorbidities affecting the
association between hypothyroidism and the presence of the composite outcome and
atrial fibrillation were age over 61 years for both outcomes, and bypass circulation
time greater than 123 minutes for atrial fibrillation.</p><p>The strengths of this study are the fact that it was conducted in an institution with
national and international quality accreditation, with an average volume of 400
cardiac surgeries per year, by a surgical team that has remained stable during this
time period; an institutional prospective and systematic collection database for all
the patients in the study; and similar mortality outcomes as those reported in the
literature. All of these factors result in less variability of care, safety of the
procedures, and quality of the information<sup>[<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The limitations of the study, derived from its retrospective nature, were controlled
by the selection of a cohort coming from a prospective data collection with the same
operationalization protocol for the variables of all the patients; outcome
stratification in accordance with clinical and subclinical hypothyroidism which
requires an <italic>ad hoc</italic> study that will be conducted once the sample
size is completed for the stratified outcomes; the assessment of other factors that
could impact the magnitude of the association of hypothyroidism; and the assessment
of other outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Hypothyroid patients taken to myocardial revascularization surgery are older and have
a higher prevalence of arterial hypertension than the non-hypothyroid
population.</p><p>Hypothyroidism is a disease that affects females predominantly but is not a
determining factor for the presence of other comorbidities apart from the ones
mentioned above.</p><p>Mortality in patients undergoing myocardial revascularization surgery in this
institution is comparable to that observed in American and European series.</p><p>Hypothyroidism is an independent, comorbidity-adjusted risk factor for the onset of
postoperative atrial fibrillation in patients undergoing myocardial
revascularization.</p><p>In this study, hypothyroidism was not a factor associated with the occurrence of
mortality, surgical site infection or reoperation due to bleeding.</p><p>Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term impact of this comorbidity in
patients undergoing myocardial revascularization in order to determine whether it
affects the survival of the procedure.</p><table-wrap id="t6" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="50%" span="1"/><col width="50%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MCJ</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Substantial contributions to the conception or design

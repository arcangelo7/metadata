physiology, device development, or outcomes research. All of these areas are important
to our specialty, but when should research training be undertaken and what are the
benefits to the resident? The optimal timing for a research experience should be
relatively early, after making a commitment to a career in thoracic surgery. For some,
this may be after medical school, prior to internship and residency, and for others, it
would be during the first years of surgical training. Although it is possible to gain
research experience as a fully qualified thoracic surgeon, the clinical and
administrative commitments of practice often take precedence, and special dedication and
discipline are necessary for a surgeon to acquire education in research at a later stage
in his or her career.</p><p>The ideal duration for a research experience may vary for different individuals. We
believe that at least two years of dedicated time is required to gain the knowledge and
important tools necessary to master a specific area of investigation, and to accomplish
significant milestones in research, <italic>e.g</italic>. presentations and
publications. It is important also to consider further formal education during a
dedicated research experience. This should be tailored towards the trainee&#x02019;s interests
and the opportunities available at the resident&#x02019;s institution. At Mayo Clinic, many
residents and fellows pursue a postdoctoral Certificate or Master&#x02019;s degree in Clinical
and Translational Sciences, but other possibilities include Master&#x02019;s and PhD programs in
Biomedical Sciences and Public Health. Much can be learned from working on focused
projects with surgical mentors, but participating in educational programs with formal
curricula greatly expands the resident&#x02019;s knowledge base.</p><p>There are several benefits of a research experience; one might be something as simple and
practical as career advancement. The Resident may choose to go into the laboratory to
improve his or her opportunity to obtain a residency position, post-residency
fellowship, or academic staff position.</p><p>Another benefit of research is the satisfaction of the discovery and the recognition
obtained through presentations and publications. Most residents spend five to seven
years of medical school and residency absorbing as much general information in medicine
and science as possible. In contrast, during a research experience, the trainee usually
focuses on one problem in depth and can become an expert in that area.</p><p>For some, the research experience will be a direct lead into a career in investigation as
a surgeon/scientist. The research fellow may continue investigation during clinical
training and subsequently secure extramural funding. This might be considered the ideal
outcome of resident research, but it happens to only a minority of residents who
undertake dedicated time for research.</p><p>There is another rarely considered benefit of research; often, techniques and concepts
mastered while doing research can be applied later to problems that are wholly unrelated
to the original project. For example, during a research fellowship year, one of the
authors worked in the laboratory of Dr. Vincent L. Gott, investigating methods of
myocardial protection in a modified Langendorf preparation<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. In this model, left
ventricular function was measured with an intraventricular balloon, and we observed an
increase in end-diastolic pressure when the balloon was reinflated, following an hour of
ischemic arrest<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Reintroducing the same volume after arrest resulted in
elevation of the end-diastolic pressure; this occurred in proportion to the decrease in
systolic function.</p><p>Further experiments focusing on ventricular compliance demonstrated that the increase in
end-diastolic pressure of post-arrest hearts was due to a smaller unstressed volume,
rather than a change in compliance of the muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure
1</xref>). It appeared that ventricular chamber size was smaller in hearts injured
by ischemia/reperfusion, and refilling the ventricles to prearrest volumes resulted in
increased pressure<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. These laboratory experiments led to an understanding of
the important relationship between ventricular volume and diastolic function.</p><p>
<fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Experimental studies of ischemic arrest and reperfusion illustrate a
mechanism of elevated end-diastolic pressure. End-diastolic pressure volume
curves from a typical experiment in an isolated heart preparation
demonstrate that prearrest and postarrest curves are exponential; postarrest
diastolic pressure (Ped) is greater than prearrest diastolic pressure at any
end-diastolic volume (Ved). As seen in the lower exponential plot, the
end-diastolic pressure volume relationship is shifted upward and to the left
and is not due to an increase in the slope or stiffness constant (&#x003b1;).
Rather, the increased pressure is due to a reduction in the unstressed
volume (&#x003b2;), i.e, a smaller cavity. Copyrighted and used with

</p><p>At Mayo Clinic, we evaluate and treat a large number of patients with hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (HCM). In one particular phenotype of HCM, patients have an apical
distribution of left ventricular hypertrophy<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. Management of patients with apical HCM who
develop heart failure is difficult as medical therapy is rarely effective and cardiac
transplantation is the only surgical option. We observed that the most severely limited
patients with apical HCM had small ventricular chambers as a result of the apical muscle
mass. Further, we speculated that the elevated end-diastolic pressure in patients might
be the result of a small left ventricular chamber size, as was true for the isolated
hearts that had been injured by ischemic arrest and reperfusion in the experimental
laboratory.</p><p>It followed then, that surgical enlargement of the ventricle by apical myectomy might
improve diastolic function in symptomatic patients with apical HCM and small left
ventricular chamber size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). In this
procedure, the ventricle is enlarged through an apical ventriculotomy; muscle is removed
from the septum, the anterior wall of the ventricle, and occasionally, the papillary
muscles are shaved. First performed in September 1993, this operation has been employed
in over 100 patients to relieve diastolic heart failure, and an informal comparison of
these surgical patients with national HCM patients listed for heart transplantation
demonstrated better survival in those undergoing apical myectomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>)<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>

</p><p>It is impossible to know whether this operation for apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
would have been developed without the previous laboratory study of diastolic function.
We suspect that the procedure would have been undertaken by someone at some time in the
future, but recalling that the diastolic dysfunction in reperfused hearts may not be
muscle stiffness per se, but reduced ventricular volume, led us to develop an operation
for diastolic dysfunction in HCM. This was an unexpected benefit of a research, 20 years
after an initial laboratory experience.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by the Paul and Ruby Tsai Family.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Schaff</surname><given-names>HV</given-names></name><name><surname>Dombroff</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Flaherty</surname><given-names>JT</given-names></name><name><surname>Bulkley</surname><given-names>BH</given-names></name><name><surname>Hutchins</surname><given-names>GM</given-names></name><name><surname>Goldman</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Effect of potassium cardioplegia on myocardial ischemia and post

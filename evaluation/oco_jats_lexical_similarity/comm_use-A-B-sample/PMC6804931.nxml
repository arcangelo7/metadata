Tg6 mice with chronic erythropoietin overexpression have a high hematocrit, reduced trabecular and cortical bone and bone marrow adipocytes, and decreased bone morphogenic protein 2 driven ectopic bone and adipocyte formation. Erythropoietin treatment (1 200&#x02009;IU&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>) for 10 days similarly exhibit increased hematocrit, reduced bone and bone marrow adipocytes without increased osteoclasts, and reduced bone morphogenic protein signaling in the bone marrow. Interestingly, endogenous erythropoietin is required for normal differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells to osteoblasts and bone marrow adipocytes. &#x00394;EpoR<sub>E</sub> mice with erythroid restricted erythropoietin receptor exhibit reduced trabecular bone, increased bone marrow adipocytes, and decreased bone morphogenic protein 2 ectopic bone formation. Erythropoietin treated &#x00394;EpoR<sub>E</sub> mice achieved hematocrit similar to wild-type mice without reduced bone, suggesting that bone reduction with erythropoietin treatment is associated with non-erythropoietic erythropoietin response. Bone marrow stromal cells from wild-type, Tg6, and &#x00394;EpoR<sub>E</sub>-mice were transplanted into immunodeficient mice to assess development into a bone/marrow organ. Like endogenous bone formation, Tg6 bone marrow cells exhibited reduced differentiation to bone and adipocytes indicating that high erythropoietin inhibits osteogenesis and adipogenesis, while &#x00394;EpoR<sub>E</sub> bone marrow cells formed ectopic bones with reduced trabecular regions and increased adipocytes, indicating that loss of erythropoietin signaling favors adipogenesis at the expense of osteogenesis. In summary, endogenous erythropoietin signaling regulates bone marrow stromal cell fate and aberrant erythropoietin levels result in their impaired differentiation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Bone</kwd><kwd>Fat metabolism</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>This work was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research at the National Institutes of Health.</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Erythropoietin (EPO), a cytokine produced in fetal liver and adult kidneys, is required for production of red blood cells.

In mice, age related changes in bone microarchitecture occur early in life with peak trabecular BV between the ages of 6 and 8 weeks followed by a steady decline specifically in the long bone metaphyses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> In our study, in the younger &#x02206;EpoR<sub>E</sub> mice of 8 weeks of age, the absence of endogenous EPO signaling showed early signs of reduction in trabecular bone with fewer trabeculae and increased spacing. However, at 11 weeks of age, reduction in trabecular bone becomes apparent with significant reduction in trabecular BMD and trabecular BV. The &#x00394;EpoR<sub>E</sub>-mice gains body weight and fat mass with age because of lack of Epo signaling in non-hematopoietic tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> Increased fat mass is associated with lower BMD in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> and in humans obesity is reported to show low bone formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> Compared to body weight matched wild-type mice, the &#x00394;EpoR<sub>E</sub>-mice had reduced trabecular bone ruling out the role of body weight as a factor for reduced bone phenotype. But, we cannot exclude the possibility of increased fat mass in the 11-week-old &#x00394;EpoR<sub>E</sub> mice contributing to a low bone phenotype in our study.</p><p id="Par20">Endogenous EPO is also important in osteoclast differentiation particularly as mice become older as we observed increased osteoclasts in the 11-week-old &#x02206;EpoR<sub>E</sub> mice. These mice also have systemic inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and gain body weight with age. Therefore, the increase in osteoclasts seen in 11-week-old mice might be associated with their high level of inflammation consistent with previous reports linking increased osteoclast differentiation to inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> In mice models, induction of systemic inflammation by methods like high-fat diet feeding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> or administration of lipopolysaccharide is associated with enhanced osteoclastogenesis causing bone resorption resulting in bone loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> Thus, the reduction in bone seen in the 11-week-old &#x02206;EpoR<sub>E</sub> mice could also be a consequence of inflammation arising due to the lack of Epo signaling in non-hematopoietic tissues. Therefore, we assessed bone parameters in younger &#x02206;EpoR<sub>E</sub> mice 8 weeks of age where their body weight is similar to control mice. In young &#x02206;EpoR<sub>E</sub> mice we still observed reduction in trabecular bone, but there was no increase in osteoclasts or increased <italic>Cathepsin K</italic> suggesting the initial disruption of trabecular bone occurring in young &#x02206;EpoR<sub>E</sub> mice as an osteoclast-independent mechanism. Thus our data show endogenous EPO as an essential cytokine with varying levels of regulation in the bone environment. In younger mice with rapid bone development as well as in older mice with age induced skeletal disruption endogenous EPO is required for normal bone development particularly in the maintenance of trabecular bone microarchitecture.</p><p id="Par21">Exogenous EPO administration increases hematocrit in a dose dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> and in mice both low dose (300&#x02009;U&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> and high dose (9&#x02009;000&#x02009;U&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> of EPO administration reduced trabecular bone in long bones. However, whether EPO-induced bone loss is associated with EPO stimulated erythropoiesis or is entirely mediated by non-erythroid cells is not known. Therefore, we injected young wild-type and &#x02206;EpoR<sub>E</sub> mice 6 weeks of age with 1&#x02009;200&#x02009;U&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> rhEPO for 10 days to achieve increased hematocrit during the period of maximum bone remodeling in mice. Unlike wild-type mice, EPO treatment in &#x02206;EpoR<sub>E</sub> mice did not result in trabecular bone loss despite increasing hematocrit levels comparable to EPO treated wild-type mice. This provides evidence that reduced bone parameters seen with elevated EPO is independent of erythropoiesis and is mediated by non-erythroid cell response.</p><p id="Par22">The role of endogenous EPO signaling in marrow adipogenesis has not been reported. The increased marrow adiposity in &#x02206;EpoR<sub>E</sub> mice shows that lack of EPO signaling in non-erythroid cells leads to a fatty marrow. The &#x02206;EpoR<sub>E</sub> mice gain increased body weight because of accumulation of white fat mass and this accrual increases with age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> In younger &#x02206;EpoR<sub>E</sub> mice of 8 weeks of age, we observed significant increase in marrow adipocytes even before these mice started to gain weight compared to the age-matched wild-type mice. These data show endogenous EPO signaling as an important regulator of marrow adiposity. In the bone marrow of female mice there was extensive adiposity compared with age-matched male mice. A steep increase in marrow adiposity is also observed in menopausal women with 10% more vertebral marrow fat than men of similar age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> The reduction in marrow adipocytes in both wild-type and &#x02206;EpoR<sub>E</sub>-mice with EPO administration shows that this process is due to EPO stimulated erythropoiesis in the marrow. Thus, EPO regulation of bone marrow adipocytes is different from EPO regulation of adipocytes in external fat depots. As previously reported, &#x02206;EpoR<sub>E</sub> mice that do not express <italic>Epor</italic> in adipose tissue do not lose white fat mass with EPO treatment despite increased hematocrit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> Loss of bone marrow adipocytes with EPO treatment does not depend on the presence of <italic>Epor</italic> on these cells as both wild-type and &#x02206;EpoR<sub>E</sub>-mice lose bone marrow adipocytes. However, endogenous EPO&#x02013;EPOR signaling is important for regulated bone marrow adipogenesis because its absence results in fatty marrow in &#x02206;EpoR<sub>E</sub> mice. These data suggest that the reduction in bone and marrow fat by elevated EPO is mediated differently. With bone loss, we observe an erythropoietic independent action of EPO, whereas reduction in marrow adipocytes is associated with EPO stimulated increased erythroid cell production in the marrow.</p><p id="Par23">The reduced bone observed in Tg6 mice and in wild-type mice receiving EPO has been associated with increased osteoclasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> Our findings in Tg6-mice were similar to the previous report, but we did not observe osteoclast induction in mice with acute EPO treatment despite bone loss. Bone loss in wild-type mice treated with EPO without an increase in osteoclasts was also previously observed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> Similarly, addition of EPO did not stimulate osteoclast differentiation in vitro, consistent with report on lack of EPO effect in in vitro osteoclast cultures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> Thus, elevated EPO in chronic and acute conditions reduce trabecular bone possibly by different mechanisms. Increase in osteoclasts with chronic elevated EPO can contribute to bone reduction, but is less evident in acute EPO treatment. The response of osteoclasts to chronic EPO is known and we also observed increased osteoclasts in the Tg6-mice bones and marrow cultures, but the osteoblast response to chronic EPO in the Tg6-mice has not been previously reported. We observed increased <italic>Alp</italic>, <italic>Osterix</italic> expression in the primary osteogenic cells from these mice along with increased mineralization in cultures. Early reports of analysis of bone markers in Tg6 mice identified increased serum TRAP and reduced serum Osteocalcin levels,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> suggesting a high bone resorption and low bone formation rate. Based on gene expression and in vitro osteogenic cultures from our studies along with information on the bone markers in Tg6 mice, it can be concluded that chronic exposure to high levels of EPO results in both increased osteoclast and osteoblast activity causing high bone turnover resulting in bone reduction.</p><p id="Par24">We find elevated EPO reducing <italic>Bmp</italic> levels in both chronic and acute conditions. <italic>Bmp2</italic> and <italic>Bmp6</italic> are important osteogenic factors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> produced in the bone marrow by macrophages, osteoblasts, and chondrocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> Expression of EPOR by all these cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> raises the potential for regulation of BMP signaling by EPO. In Tg6 mice, high EPO levels inhibited the ectopic bone formation potential of BMP2, in an osteoclast independent manner. In this assay, ossicles formed in Tg6 mice were exposed to elevated EPO only for 4 weeks, a duration similar to acute EPO treatment in mice. In both these conditions, increased EPO did not increase osteoclasts but reduced bone suggesting that the primary response of elevated EPO in bone is not to stimulate bone resorption but to inhibit bone formation. Elevated EPO exposure for a prolonged period of time might eventually increase osteoclasts and contribute to reduced bone as seen in Tg6 mice. Previous studies showed EPO synergistically interacting with BMP2 to promote bone formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> in calvarial defect models where EPO promotes tissue repair by augmenting BMP2 induced osteogenesis. In addition to reducing bone formation, we observed that elevated EPO increased marrow and reduced adipocytes in ectopic bone, consistent with an earlier report.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> In the &#x02206;EpoR<sub>E</sub> mice, we observed reduced <italic>Bmp2</italic> in the marrow and a reduction in BMP2-induced ectopic bone formation. Therefore, both elevated EPO and disrupted endogenous EPO signaling inhibits BMP2-induced osteogenesis and aberrant BMP signaling could be one mechanism by which osteogenesis is impaired under these conditions.</p><p id="Par25">Precursors of osteoblasts in the postnatal organism are BMSCs, and we examined the function of EPO signaling on BMSC differentiation in conditions of elevated EPO and in the absence of endogenous EPO signaling using in vivo bone formation assays.

These cells have increased <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic> expression in the Tg6-BMSCs with reduced <italic>Ppar-</italic>&#x003b3; expression. GATA2 and GATA3 have been shown to inhibit PPAR-&#x003b3; activity and thereby reduce adipogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> The essential role of endogenous EPO signaling in BMSC differentiation is evident from the wild-type BMSCs expressing <italic>Epor</italic>, which formed ectopic bone with distinct trabecular and cortical bone with well distributed adipocytes in the marrow space. Conversely, BMSCs from &#x02206;EpoR<sub>E</sub> mice, which do not express <italic>Epor</italic>, and therefore do not respond to circulating EPO in the recipient mouse, formed bone with less trabeculae and more adipocytes.

Differentiation assays with sorted primary BMSCs also were not possible as the BMSCs did not survive by themselves after couple of days in culture. Our data show that the EPO effect in BMSC differentiation in vivo is different from in vitro culture conditions reported previously. The ectopic bone/marrow formation assay with BMSCs also reflects the bone architecture of the mouse models we used; Tg6&#x02013;BMSCs have decreased osteogenesis and adipogenesis and Tg6 mice have reduced bone and marrow adipocytes (Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). &#x02206;EpoR<sub>E</sub>&#x02013;BMSCs developed less trabecular bone and more bone marrow adipocytes consistent with the bone in these mice (Figs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Thus, absence of EPO signaling disproportionately increases the differentiation of BMSCs to marrow adipocytes with reduction in osteogenesis, while high EPO signaling in BMSCs decreases their differentiation to either lineages.</p><p id="Par27">In conclusion, we provide evidence for the essential role for both endogenous EPO and elevated EPO signaling in the development of bone and marrow adipocytes.

Few previous studies have reported a causal relationship between FFAs and osteoarthritis pathogenesis. However, the molecular mechanism by which FFAs exert lipotoxicity and induce osteoarthritis remains largely unknown. We here observed that oleate at the usual clinical range does not exert lipotoxicity while oleate at high pathological ranges exerted lipotoxicity through apoptosis in articular chondrocytes. By investigating the differential effect of oleate at toxic and nontoxic concentrations, we revealed that lipid droplet (LD) accumulation confers articular chondrocytes, the resistance to lipotoxicity. Using high fat diet-induced osteoarthritis models and articular chondrocytes treated with oleate alone or oleate plus palmitate, we demonstrated that articular chondrocytes gain resistance to lipotoxicity through protein kinase casein kinase 2 (PKCK2)&#x02014;six-transmembrane protein of prostate 2 (STAMP2)&#x02014;and fat-specific protein 27 (FSP27)-mediated LD accumulation. We further observed that the exertion of FFAs-induced lipotoxicity was correlated with the increased concentration of cellular FFAs freed from LDs, whether FFAs are saturated or not. In conclusion, PKCK2/STAMP2/FSP27-mediated sequestration of FFAs in LD rescues osteoarthritic chondrocytes. PKCK2/STAMP2/FSP27 should be considered for interventions against metabolic OA.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="LongSummary"><title>Oil droplets protect cartilage from toxic fatty acids</title><p id="Par2">Cartilage tissue deals with the stress of exposure to free fatty acids by sequestering the toxic molecules into sub-cellular oil droplets.

In these rat cells and in experiments involving mouse models of osteoarthritis fed a high-fat diet, the researchers then identified three of the protective proteins needed for cartilage tissue to properly quarantine fatty acids into oil droplets.

Because chondrocytes are the only resident cells in human articular cartilage and cell matrix turnover in cartilage is solely dependent on these cells, the death of articular chondrocytes is generally considered to play a central role in OA cartilage destruction. To date, stimuli involved in chondrocyte death and their signalling pathways have been highlighted as pathogenetic factors leading to joint cartilage degradation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup></p><p id="Par4">OA is now considered a complex disease with different clinical subtypes. Among these subtypes, metabolic OA is distinguished from other subtypes by the presence of obesity or metabolic syndrome, low-grade systemic inflammation, earlier onset and a faster progression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> However, the concept of the disease as a 'wear-and-tear disease', which is traditionally accepted for the pathophysiology of OA, does not seem to account for the cartilage destruction in metabolic OA. Moreover, joint overload is unable to explain strong epidemiological data, demonstrating the association between obesity and hand OA,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> although obese patients with metabolic syndrome have an increased risk of knee OA compared with that of obese patients without metabolic syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> Thus, systemic factors must be involved in the pathogenesis of OA. Recent studies led to the discovery of pro-inflammatory cytokines and adipokines produced by the adipose tissue as central contributors to metabolic OA of the hand and potentially other locations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup></p><p id="Par5">Lipid imbalance is a key metabolic alteration associated with metabolic syndrome and obesity. In hyperlipidaemic states, lipids abnormally accumulate in non-adipose tissues. Articular chondrocytes, unlike most other cells, are characterised by their substantial stores of lipid deposits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> A previous study demonstrated the existence of a marked and graded increase in the total fatty acids in articular cartilage from OA joints.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> In hyperlipidaemic states, the accumulation of excess lipids in non-adipose tissues exerts lipotoxicity, leading to cell dysfunction and/or cell death. Free fatty acids (FFAs), which are elevated with metabolic syndrome or obesity, are considered the principal offender exerting lipotoxicity and inducing apoptosis, insulin resistance and inflammation. Thus, it seems readily presumable that the accumulation of FFAs contributes to OA pathogenesis. However, the causal relationship between FFAs and OA pathogenesis has only recently been demonstrated. Few previous studies demonstrated that dietary fat induced osteoarthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> In addition, a recent study demonstrated that palmitate, but not oleate, has a pro-apoptotic effect on interleukin 1 beta (IL-1-&#x003b2;)-stimulated articular chondrocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> However, the molecular mechanism by which FFAs exert lipotoxicity remains largely unknown.</p><p id="Par6">In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism by which FFAs exert pro-apoptotic effects by focusing on the following urgent questions related to FFA accumulation-associated OA. First, what is the underlying mechanism by which FFA exerts lipotoxicity in articular chondrocytes? Second, what is the meaning of the differential effect of saturated FFA and unsaturated FFA on chondrocyte death in terms of OA pathophysiology? Third, with the assumption that articular chondrocytes struggle to survive against FFA-induced lipotoxicity, what is the mechanism by which articular chondrocytes survive under the effects of FFA accumulation?</p><p id="Par7">Our results demonstrated that protein kinase casein kinase 2 (PKCK2)&#x02011;, six-transmembrane protein of prostate 2 (STAMP2)&#x02011; and fat-specific protein 27 (FSP27)-mediated sequestration of FFAs in lipid droplets (LDs) confers articular chondrocytes the ability to resist lipotoxicity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>High-fed diet (HFD) accelerates the onset of OA</title><p id="Par8">Using two experimental mouse OA models, we examined whether an HFD accelerated the onset of OA. The onset of OA was determined by histological findings characteristic of OA, such as an irregular surface, the disappearance of surface layer cells and reduced Safranin O staining. First, mice fed a standard diet (SD) or an HFD for 12 weeks were subjected to surgery for experimental OA, and after the indicated time, cartilages were histologically observed. Among various surgical OA models, we used the anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) model, which is the most commonly used surgical model in OA research today. We could observe the onset of OA at 4 weeks (6/10) or at least 6 weeks (10/10) after surgery in mice fed an HFD. In contrast, these findings were not observed in any mouse fed an SD 4 weeks after surgery, while these findings were observed at 6 weeks (3/10) and 8 weeks (10/10) after surgery in mice fed an SD. There was a statistically significant difference between the SD and HFD based on the likelihood ratio test of the Poisson regression model (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.000 000 000 030 05). OA was also more severe in HFD-fed mice compared to SD-fed mice as determined by Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) scoring (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Furthermore, we examined the onset of OA findings in mice fed an SD or an HFD for 25 weeks without surgery for experimental OA. We observed characteristic OA findings in all mice fed an HFD (10/10) but not in any mouse fed an SD (0/10). Indeed, there was statistical significance for the probability of OA findings between mice fed an SD or an HFD based on the <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> test (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.019 92). OA was also more severe in HFD-fed mice compared to SD-fed mice as determined by OARSI scoring (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). These findings indicate that long time HFD feeding itself induces the onset of OA.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>HFD accelerates the onset of OA.

We next examined whether FFAs exert lipotoxicity in rat articular chondrocytes. Although several studies have suggested that there is an increased FFA concentration in OA synovial fluid,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> no documented studies have reported the FFA levels in the synovial fluid of OA subjects.

We observed that palmitate or stearate at 0.5&#x02013;2&#x02009;mmol&#x000b7;L<sup>-1</sup> reduced the viability of rat articular chondrocytes. While oleate at 0.5&#x02013;1.25&#x02009;mmol&#x000b7;L<sup>-1</sup> did not reduce cell viability, oleate at 1.5&#x02013;2.0&#x02009;mmol&#x000b7;L<sup>-1</sup> significantly reduced the viability of rat articular chondrocytes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Although most previous reports using oleate under 1.0&#x02009;mmol&#x000b7;L<sup>-1</sup> found that oleate did not exert lipotoxicity, our findings suggest that oleate at high pathological ranges exerts lipotoxicity in articular chondrocytes. We next examined the underlying mechanism by which toxic concentrations of oleate exert lipotoxicity. Quantification of DNA hypoploidy by flow cytometry showed that subdiploid apoptotic cells were accumulated (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>) and evaluation of nuclear morphology demonstrated that nuclear condensation and fragmentation were increased (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). Furthermore, western blot assays showed that 1.5&#x02009;mmol&#x000b7;L<sup>-1</sup> oleate produced caspase-3 and -7, and PARP cleavage products (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>) and a pancaspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk completely reversed the oleate-induced cytotoxicity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). These data indicate that toxic concentrations of oleate exerted lipotoxicity in articular chondrocytes through apoptosis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b&#x02013;e</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>FFAs exert lipotoxicity in rat articular chondrocytes. <bold>a</bold> Viability assay.

Confocal microscopy demonstrated that giant LDs formed in chondrocytes treated with nontoxic concentrations of oleate. Importantly, toxic concentrations of oleate reduced the size of LDs and the total LD volume (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Toxic concentration of oleate significantly increased the population of TUNEL-positive cells and giant LDs were not observed in TUNEL-positive cells. The total LD volume was significantly reduced in TUNEL-positive cells undergoing apoptosis compared with that of TUNEL-negative cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). We next examined whether knockdown of FSP27, which is associated with the surface of intracellular LD, involves in the resistance of articular chondrocytes to lipotoxicity. Western blot assays showed that toxic concentrations of oleate decreased the expression level of FSP27 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>) and the knockdown of FSP27 markedly reduced the total LD volume in articular chondrocytes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). Notably, 1&#x02009;mmol&#x000b7;L<sup>-1</sup> oleate substantially induced cell death in FSP27-depleted chondrocytes, indicating that FSP27 depletion sensitises chondrocytes to lipotoxicity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). These in vitro data indicate that LD accumulation through FSP27 is associated with the resistance of articular chondrocytes to oleate-induced lipotoxicity. Immunohistochemistry and BODIPY labelling on cartilages obtained from ACLT model 6 weeks after surgery show that the population of FSP27-positive articular chondrocytes was significantly smaller in mice fed an HFD than in mice fed an SD and LDs are accumulated in mice fed an HFD (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>). These data suggest that FSP27 confers articular chondrocytes the ability to resist lipotoxicity through maintaining LD accumulation.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>The maintenance of accumulated LD is associated with the resistance of articular chondrocytes to lipotoxicity. <bold>a</bold> Representative Nile red and BODIPY staining.

These data suggest that PKCK2 prohibits dietary fat-induced lipotoxicity in articular chondrocytes. Thus, we further examined the detailed mechanism underlying the prohibition of lipotoxicity in vitro. Our viability assay revealed that 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazol riboside (DRB), a PKCK2 inhibitor, sensitised chondrocytes to cell death induced by all types of FFA tested (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). We further examined whether FFAs downregulate PKCK2. Noticeably, toxic concentrations of all FFAs reduced the expression level of PKCK2 protein. And we observed that oleate at 1.5&#x02009;mmol&#x000b7;L<sup>-1</sup>, but not at 1&#x02013;1.25&#x02009;mmol&#x000b7;L<sup>-1</sup>, markedly reduced the expression level of the PKCK2 protein (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). We next examined whether PKCK2 inhibition sensitises chondrocytes to lipotoxicity. Western blot assays demonstrated that 1&#x02009;mmol&#x000b7;L<sup>-1</sup> oleate in conjunction with DRB induced the activation of pro-apoptotic caspase-3 and -7 in articular chondrocytes. While 1&#x02009;mmol&#x000b7;L<sup>-1</sup> oleate did not alter the FSP27 protein expression level, 1&#x02009;mmol&#x000b7;L<sup>-1</sup> oleate plus 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;mol&#x000b7;L<sup>-1</sup> DRB decreased the FSP27 protein level (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>).

These findings suggest that PKCK2 inhibition prohibits oleate-caused LD enlargement, resulting in the induction of apoptosis. Because cilostazol prevents the reduction of PKCK2 activity in rat articular chondrocytes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> we next examined whether the upregulation of PKCK2 by cilostazol would protect articular chondrocytes from oleate-induced lipoapoptosis.

While lipotoxicity from the accumulation of long-chain FFAs is specific for saturated FFAs, co-supplementation with unsaturated FFAs rescues saturated FFA-induced lipoapoptosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> It is a well-known metabolic phenomenon that triglycerides accumulate in response to the increased cellular level of unsaturated FFAs. Not only exogenous oleate but endogenously generated unsaturated FFAs lead to triglyceride accumulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> The mechanism of cellular triglyceride accumulation by unsaturated FFAs has been demonstrated in several studies. One such study dissected the molecular role of cellular triglyceride accumulation by unsaturated FFAs. The study revealed that unsaturated FFAs rescue palmitate-induced apoptosis by channelling palmitate into triglyceride pools, which suggests that the accumulation of excess FFAs in triglyceride pools likely diverts these molecules from pathways leading to lipotoxicity and serves as a buffer against lipotoxicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup></p><p id="Par19">The present study is the first to demonstrate that triglyceride accumulation in response to oleate supplementation represents a defence against lipotoxicity in articular chondrocytes. Because articular chondrocytes are unable to utilise accumulated lipids for energy purposes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> this accumulation of excess FFAs in triglyceride pools or LDs seems to divert FFAs from the pathway leading to lipotoxicity. While articular chondrocytes protect themselves from lipotoxicity by sequestering palmitate within LDs, lipotoxicity by palmitate likely occurs when either the cellular capacity for triglyceride storage is exceeded or LDs are destroyed, resulting in increased cellular palmitate. In addition, our observations offer a new perspective on the exhibition of lipotoxicity by unsaturated FFAs. We observed that oleate, at a concentration that degrades LDs and increases cellular FFAs, also exerted lipotoxicity, while supplementation with oleate at a concentration that leads to triglyceride accumulation was well tolerated. Based on these findings, the exhibition of lipotoxicity by FFAs in chondrocytes seems to depend on the increased concentration of FFAs freed from LDs, whether FFAs are saturated or not. Although the duration and extent of lipid overload, in general, may determine whether a cell is protective or damaged, oleate after a rather small changes in concentration (1.25&#x02013;1.5&#x02009;mmol&#x000b7;L<sup>-1</sup>) markedly reduced chondrocytes viability. Within this narrow range of oleate concentration, oleate storage capacity seems to be exceeded and triglyceride appears to be eventually hydrolysed, abruptly increasing toxic lipids to exert lipotoxicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> However, for understanding the molecular mechanism underlying this abrupt lipotoxicity exerted by oleate in chondrocytes, further future study is required.

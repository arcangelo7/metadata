These reported the use of 20 different BCTs. Social support (unspecified) was used in all studies and goal setting (behaviour) in 10. Of the 11 studies, 10 reported effectiveness in reducing CVD risk factors, but one study showed no improvement compared to usual care.

Medical Research Council (MRC) guidelines<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> advise the application of behaviour change theory within complex health service interventions, and its use within the evaluation of interventions, to allow greater understanding of exactly how behaviour change is occurring.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidance in 2014 on individual-level behaviour change interventions for promoting change in modifiable cardiovascular risk factors.<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> These guidelines indicate that the three behaviour change areas most positively associated with promoting change in modifiable vascular risk factors are goals and planning, feedback and monitoring, and social support. These areas correspond to Michie&#x02019;s BCT taxonomy.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> This is a taxonomy of 93 hierarchically clustered techniques used to facilitate behaviour change within interventions.</p><p>There is strong evidence via systematic reviews and meta-analysis<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> to support the use of CR programmes, including home-based approaches, in a patient population with CVD, particularly for those who have experienced a myocardial infarction (MI). Yet, despite the evidence for this positive treatment option for vascular secondary prevention, there is not a clear understanding of how this complex health service intervention influences behaviour change related to modifiable cardiovascular risk factors. No previous reviews have been identified that have examined programme components in the context of Michie&#x02019;s BCT taxonomy.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The aim of this review is therefore to identify the BCTs that have been used in home-based CR programmes, and to describe the frequency of their use in programmes that were effective in reducing CVD risk factors.</p><p>Although rehabilitation and secondary prevention programmes following a cardiovascular event are well-evidenced,<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> there has been little focus on the use of specific BCTs, particularly within programmes in the setting of the patient&#x02019;s home. An understanding of which BCTs are being utilised is important to allow more accurate replication in implementation of the intervention, both within clinical practice and in research. Understanding which BCTs are being used allows an exploration of causal pathways, thus allowing intervention refinement by either reducing content to that which is working, or improving aspects that are not working. This systematic review aims to help identify the particular BCTs that are associated with improvements in specific modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, and to contribute to an evidence base on which home-based rehabilitation interventions can be further developed and refined for use with CVD patients.</p><boxed-text position="float"><sec><title>How this fits in</title><p>Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is effective in promoting secondary cardiovascular prevention, and includes advice about healthy lifestyle behaviours, but little is known about the use of behaviour change techniques (BCTs) recommended in supporting behaviour change in home-based programmes. This meta-analysis of studies published between 2005 and 2015 confirms that home-based CR is as effective as hospital- and centre-based CR in reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The BCTs involving social support, goal setting, monitoring, instructions on how to perform the behaviour, and credible source were found in studies of programmes reporting changes in CVD risk factors. Awareness of these BCTs should help primary care practitioners to support the delivery of home-based CR, but further research should examine the relative values of different BCTs within these programmes.</p></sec></boxed-text></sec><sec><title>METHOD</title><p>The protocol for this review has been previously published.<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The Behaviour Change Taxonomy v1<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> was used to identify the specific BCTs used within included studies. The lead authors have attended a training workshop run by the developers of the taxonomy, and one of the authors is a recognised &#x02018;expert coder&#x02019;.</p><p>This systematic review is reported in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidance.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Criteria for considering studies for this review have included human randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of home-based CR programmes initiated following a cardiovascular event, for example, post-MI or following a heart failure exacerbation. The review focused on adults, males and females, aged &#x02265;18 years. Any home-based CR programme &#x02014; a rehabilitation programme being defined by previous authors<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and delivered within the home environment &#x02014; initiated following a cardiovascular event were eligible for inclusion. The authors excluded studies that purely reviewed, for example, an exercise or training programme for the patient. The analysis included trials with a control group, and trials with multiple intervention arms (comparing different types of rehabilitation interventions). The review did not include population or community-wide interventions.</p><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The particular BCTs included in home-based CR programmes used for cardiovascular secondary prevention, classified using Michie&#x02019;s Taxonomy, were identified. In addition, recording the frequency of use of BCTs in programmes that reported reductions in CVD risk factors was undertaken. CVD risk factor outcomes in effective studies were used for a meta-analysis of the differences in effect between home-based and comparator programmes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Search methods for identification of studies</title><p>Detailed search strategies were developed for each electronic database searched, including Ovid MEDLINE<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 1946 to June 2015, Ovid Embase 1974 to June 2015, EBSCO Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) plus 1937 to June 2015, Cochrane Database and Ovid PsycINFO 1806 to June 2015.

This is the first review to collate observations on the use of BCTs within home-based CR programmes, including the Heart Manual. A total of 20 different BCTs were used in the 11 included studies, with the BCT identified as social support (unspecified) being used in all 11 studies, while the BCT goal setting (behaviour) was employed in all but one of the included studies. The BCT profile related to monitoring, instruction on how to perform the behaviour, and credible source were generally included in effective programmes. The Heart Manual intervention used the BCTs of goal setting (behaviour), monitoring of behaviour by others without feedback, self-monitoring of behaviour, self-monitoring of outcome(s) of behaviour, social support (unspecified), instruction on how to perform the behaviour, pharmacological support, and reduce negative emotions, and was consistently effective in modifying CVD risk factors in the included studies.</p><p>This review offers new information about the use of BCTs within home-based CR programmes for patients with CVD, illustrating frequent use of the BCTs of social support (unspecified) and goal setting (behaviour) within programmes that have been shown to be effective in reducing CVD risk factors. However, further robust trials that describe and evaluate the use of BCTs,<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> building on NICE guidance,<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> are required in order to refine the design of home-based CR programmes for optimal secondary prevention of CVD.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The authors have attempted to identify all studies of potential relevance to this review by developing a comprehensive search strategy and then supporting this through hand searching reference lists of all the full text articles included and excluded from the review. Visual inspection of funnel plots provided little evidence for publication bias. The authors sought to include all eligible studies regardless of publication language, although all studies included were in English.</p><p>A limitation is that studies included in this review lacked consistency in the outcome measures used, and in duration of follow-up. Combining all results in a meta-analysis was therefore difficult. This review generally pooled data collected at the end of the study per protocol. However, follow-up duration varied from 8 weeks to 1 year. The results should therefore be interpreted with caution, as shorter study durations may not allow sufficient time for the rehabilitation interventions to produce an impact on modifiable vascular risk factors and early changes may not be sustained. Intervention intensity is generally a poorly-defined concept, as discussed in a previous Cochrane systematic review,<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and differences in intervention intensity are considered to be a source of heterogeneity within complex interventions.<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Intervention intensity was different across the included studies and could be a potential source of bias within the review. The studies were generally carried out in developed countries, so that the findings may not be applicable to developing countries.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with existing literature</title><p>Previous studies have highlighted the comparable effects of home-based CR and hospital-based programmes.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> This study supports these findings by illustrating in the meta-analysis that home-based CR provides comparable improvements in CVD risk factors to other treatment options, including hospital-based approaches. Indeed all but one study illustrated the positive effect of home-based CR on modifiable CVD risk factors. However this study further develops these findings by including a wide range of patients with CVD including patients with heart failure and post-coronary vascularisation and by reviewing home-based CR programmes delivered using the latest technology (for example, smartphones), not previously reviewed.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The findings are more up-to-date than previous reviews,<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> being from 2005&#x02013;2015, and therefore applicable to current medical treatments. Home-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes are generally attractive to patients due to their accessibility,<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> helping to improve compliance.<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> They also tend to be less costly than hospital- or centre-based programmes,<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> and fit with the aim of shifting patient management from a hospital base into the community: a current theme within modern health care.</p><p>NICE published guidance in 2014 on individual-level behaviour change interventions for promoting change in modifiable cardiovascular risk factors in the public.<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> These guidelines recommend that behaviour change programmes, including lifestyle management programmes, should include support for individuals to make change through the use of self-monitoring, goal setting, social support, and relapse prevention strategies, and the provision of relevant information on the health consequences of the behaviour. In keeping with these guidelines, the BCT social support (unspecified) was employed in all studies included in this review and the BCT goal setting (behaviour) was used in all but one.<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Few studies used self-monitoring and relapse prevention strategies. Indeed only six studies<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> utilised the BCTs of self-monitoring of behaviour and self-monitoring of outcome(s) of behaviour. Of note, these BCTs were found to be used simultaneously. There is no specific BCT for relapse prevention, although this could be covered by multiple BCTs such as action planning.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Implications for research and practice</title><p>Future studies aimed at developing home-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes for patients with CVD should therefore consider the techniques of self-monitoring, goal setting, social support, and relapse prevention strategies, recommended by NICE, to maximise the likelihood of establishing and maintaining new behaviours to optimise secondary CVD prevention. In particular, self-monitoring and relapse prevention strategies should be further developed and their impact on tackling modifiable CVD risk factors assessed.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The

The frequent occurrence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria due to irrational application of antibiotics increases treatment cost and mortality. Graphene oxide (GO) has been generally reported to possess high antimicrobial activity against a wide range of bacteria <italic>in vitro</italic>.

However, the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, caused by the indiscriminate application and overuse of antibiotics, has been a global issue threatening human health for the past several decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Antimicrobial resistance is projected to cause the death of approximately 300 million people in the next 35&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Wound infection with antimicrobial-resistant bacteria aggravates wound deterioration, delays wound healing, and even causes sepsis and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Thus, it is imperative for us to find alternative ways to prevent and treat wound infection to restore the normal microenvironment for wound healing.</p><p id="Par19">In recent years, graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets have drawn much attention due to their excellent antibacterial activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Several reports have claimed that GO-based nanocomposites, whether topically applied on wounds as antibacterial agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] or incorporated into dressing scaffolds as antibacterial wound dressings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], can significantly facilitate wound healing by eradicating bacteria in wounds. GO, a derivative of graphene, is a two-dimensional one-atom-thick sheet composed of sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridized carbon atoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The observed antimicrobial properties of GO have been attributed to the combined mechanisms of bacterial membrane perturbation caused by sharp edges and oxidative stress induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Additionally, an abundance of functionalized hydroxyl, epoxy, and carboxyl groups on the graphene oxide surface enhance its hydrophilicity and biocompatibility and significantly facilitate its surface modification with other molecules or polymers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, owing to the presence of strong interplanar interactions, graphene oxide is prone to aggregate in aqueous solutions in a layer by layer manner, which potentially limits its application [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Furthermore, there is currently no consensus regarding the intrinsic antibacterial properties of bare graphene oxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Different reports claim that GO possesses strong [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], very weak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], or no [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] antimicrobial activity, or even facilitates bacterial proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare functionalized graphene oxide derivatives to consolidate the antibacterial activity of graphene oxide and make it more stable in aqueous solutions.</p><p id="Par20">Currently, there are several reports on avoiding graphene oxide aggregation by grafting certain materials, such as polydopamine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, the cytotoxicity of AgNPs is a matter of concern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Quaternary ammonium salts (QAS) are other commonly utilized bactericides that exhibit strong antibacterial activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The general antibacterial mechanism of QAS is believed to be associated with adsorption on the cell wall through electrostatic interactions, which subsequently increases membrane permeability and disrupts the membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Two-dimensional GO nanosheets have an intrinsically high surface area to volume ratio and therefore could be an ideal nanocarrier platform to load QAS at a high density, allowing a larger contact interface with bacteria to advance the antibacterial performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Moreover, QAS can also be used as cationic surfactants to facilitate dispersion of GO nanocarriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. It is worthwhile to explore the enhanced antimicrobial effects of graphene oxide-quaternary ammonium salts (GO-QAS) nanocomposites. Recently, Ye et al. reported the synthesis of graphene oxide/reduced graphene oxide-QAS nanocomposites with significant antibacterial activity through &#x003c0;&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;&#x003c0; conjugations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Tu et al. reported a click synthesis of a GO-quaternized poly(dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) nanocomposite coating with good antibacterial and antifouling ability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Despite these reports concerning the synthesis of GO-QAS with good antibacterial activity, it is still unclear whether GO-QAS has an advantage as a new antibacterial nanomaterial weapon with unique or synergistic efficiency compared with the simple combination of separate GO and QAS, and the detailed antibacterial mechanisms of GO-QAS nanocomposites are still unknown. In addition, little is known about the biocompatibility and antibacterial activity of GO-QAS <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="Par21">To address these questions, in this work, GO-QAS nanocomposites were synthesized through amidation reactions of carboxylic group end-capped QAS polymers with primary amine-decorated GO to achieve high QAS loading ratios on nanosheets, and we investigated, for the first time, the synergistic antibacterial activity of GO-QAS and the underlying antibacterial mechanisms. We demonstrated that compared with pure GO, QAS or the simple mixture of GO and QAS, GO-QAS with an optimal QAS graft ratio exhibited significantly enhanced and synergistic antibacterial activity. The antibacterial mechanisms of GO-QAS involved not only mechanical bacterial membrane perturbation, including wrapping, bacterial membrane insertion, and bacterial membrane perforation, but also oxidative stress induction. In addition, GO-QAS exhibited significant antibacterial activity against Methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant <italic>Acinetobacter baumanii</italic> (MDR-AB). Furthermore, we demonstrated the good biocompatibility of GO-QAS both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, when topically applied on infected wounds <italic>in vivo</italic> using a murine-infected full-thickness skin defect wound model, GO-QAS could eradicate pathogenic bacteria on wounds and facilitate the healing of infected wounds. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first systematic investigation of the antimicrobial and biocompatibility properties of GO-QAS both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. We expect our research to provide an in-depth understanding of the antibacterial behaviors and biocompatibility of GO-QAS and to serve as a practical reference for GO-QAS-based antibacterial wound dressings or antifouling coating materials research.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par22">GO powder (1-5 layers, 95&#x000a0;wt%, specific area 300&#x02013;450&#x000a0;m<sup>2</sup>/g) was purchased from Suzhou Tanfeng Ltd.

The quaternary ammonium polymers containing GO nanosheets were fabricated via four reaction steps. The quaternary ammonium monomer was prepared by quaternization of the hydrophobic compound 1-bromohexane with an acrylate monomer containing the tertiary amine 2-(dimethylamino) ethyl acrylate (DMAEA). The quaternary ammonium monomer AEDMHA was sequentially polymerized via the reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization technique, which is versatile and has a high tolerance to functional groups. The monomers were initiated with a carboxylic acid-containing chain transfer agent (RAFT-COOH) to polymerize the carboxylic group end-capped QAS polymer chains. Their <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra are presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">b</xref>. Compared with the spectrum of monomers, the peaks at 5.90~6.40&#x000a0;ppm assigned to protons on C=C double bonds disappeared after polymerization, indicating successful polymerization. The broadened peaks of quaternary ammonium pendants also confirmed the formation of a polymeric configuration, and the broad peak at 2.55&#x000a0;ppm that appeared was attributed to the newly formed -CH&#x02013;CH<sub>2</sub>- single bonds on the polymer backbone. The polymerization degree could be estimated by comparing the peak intensity of the three residual peaks at 5.90~6.40&#x000a0;ppm from the three protons on acrylates with the peak at 0.9&#x000a0;ppm attributed to the methyl groups on the pendant ends, and the number-average molecular weight (Mn) of the polymers was calculated as ~&#x02009;7400&#x000a0;Da, with a conversion rate of ~&#x02009;93%. To conjugate the carboxylic acid end-capped polymers, the GO nanosheet surface was decorated with amine groups via silanization with (3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (APTMS). After silanization, the GO-NH<sub>2</sub> suspension became aggregated and viscous, which may be attributed to ionic interactions between the introduced amines and carboxylic acids on the GO nanosheets. Based on the reaction yield, at least 0.89&#x000a0;mol APTMS/100&#x000a0;g GO (or 133&#x000a0;g APTMS/100&#x000a0;g GO) should have been grafted onto nanosheets. Finally, the carboxylic acid-capped quaternary ammonium polymers were covalently bonded to GO-NH<sub>2</sub> nanosheets via an amidation reaction with EDC/NHS catalysis, and four groups of GO-QAS nanocomposites with different QAS graft ratios were prepared by varying the feeding ratios of the GO-NH<sub>2</sub> and QAS polymers. After removal of the unconjugated polymers via dialysis and lyophilization, the graft ratios of QAS in GO-QAS nanosheets were estimated by calculating the product yields, and the loading ratios of QAS changed from 50 to 86.3&#x000a0;wt% of the overall solid content (see Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1).

After silanization, the sharp peak that appeared at 2940&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> was from alkyl -CH- stretching in aminopropyl groups, while the strong peak at 1050&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> is likely due to Si-O bond stretching, which confirmed successful silanization of APTMS on GO. Based on the spectrum of GO-QAS, the strong peaks at 2970 and 2940&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> were due to C-H stretching in the-CH<sub>3</sub> and -CH<sub>2</sub>- groups of the quaternary ammonium polymers. Moreover, the sharp strong peak at 1730&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> was assigned to C=O stretching of esters in polyacrylate, while another strong peak at 1170&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> was from C-O stretching of esters, which demonstrated the conjugation of polymer chains onto GO nanosheets. The high peak intensity of the polymer functional groups suggested a high polymeric content in the GO-QAS nanocomposite. To further confirm the various QAS graft ratios, four GO-QAS groups and pure QAS polymer were characterized by FTIR-ATR. The sharp peak at 1730&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> was only attributed to ester groups in QAS polymers, while the peak at 1050&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> was from the overlap of the strong peak of Si-O on GO-NH<sub>2</sub> nanosheets and the weak peak of C-N bonds on both GO-NH<sub>2</sub> and QAS polymers, and therefore, the graft ratios of QAS onto GO-NH<sub>2</sub> could be evaluated by comparing the relative peak intensities of these two regions.

However, the abuse of antibiotics in the past few decades has made it more difficult to eradicate pathogenic bacteria. Therefore, it is necessary to seek alternative materials to eradicate bacteria, such as nanomaterials. In recent years, GO nanosheets have been reported to exhibit excellent antibacterial activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, graphene oxide nanosheets tend to aggregate in aqueous solutions in a layer by layer manner due to strong interplanar interactions, which limits their broad application [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In addition, there are also several reports claiming that GO possesses weak antimicrobial activity or even facilitates bacterial proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Thus, in this study, to confirm the antibacterial activity of GO and make it more stable in solution, a graphene oxide-quaternary ammonium salt (GO-QAS) nanocomposite was synthesized through amidation reactions of carboxylic group end-capped QAS polymers with primary amine-decorated GO. The grafted QAS groups served as cationic surfactants to maintain the stability of GO nanosheets in solution and enhanced the overall antibacterial activity.</p><p id="Par79">The peak changes shown in the FTIR-ATR spectra (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>) demonstrated successful synthesis of the GO-QAS nanocomposite. Then, the GO-QAS nanocomposite was characterized with SEM, TEM, AFM, DLS, zeta potential, and TGA. The SEM images showed that GO-QAS showed a sheet-like morphology with wrinkled surfaces (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">d</xref>), which was more distinct in the TEM images (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">f</xref>). The AFM and DLS measurements revealed that the thickness and particle size of GO-QAS were slightly larger than that of GO (Fig.<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>), which was caused by the coverage of QAS on the basal plane of GO and indirectly indicated the formation of the GO-QAS nanocomposite. The zeta potential difference between GO-QAS and GO was attributed to grafting of the positively charged QAS onto the negatively charged GO nanosheets (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>), which further demonstrated successful synthesis of the GO-QAS nanocomposite. The TGA results demonstrated that the GO-QAS nanocomposite contained 8.9&#x000a0;wt% GO, 9.2&#x000a0;wt% APTMS, and 81.9&#x000a0;wt% QAS.</p><p id="Par80">Since the QAS graft ratio in the GO-QAS polymer could significantly affect the antimicrobial properties, to determine the optimal QAS graft ratio at which the GO-QAS nanocomposite exhibited the strongest antibacterial activity, we investigated the antibacterial activity of GO-QAS with diverse QAS graft ratios. The cell viability results (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">b</xref>) showed that GO-QAS-3 (QAS mass fraction&#x02009;=&#x02009;81.3%) exhibited the optimal QAS graft ratio, which also indicated that the antibacterial effect of GO-QAS was attributed not to GO or QAS alone but to a synergistic effect of GO and QAS. Since GO-QAS-3 showed the highest antibacterial activity, GO-QAS-3 (the optimized GO-QAS) was utilized in the following experiments.</p><p id="Par81">After we determined the optimized QAS graft ratio, it was necessary for us to further detect the antibacterial properties of the optimized GO-QAS nanosheets. The results (see Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1) showed that GO-QAS possessed visible bactericidal activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Interestingly, GO could not form an inhibition zone for either bacteria due to the poor diffusion property of GO on the agar plate, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], which might be caused by Van der Waals interactions between nanosheets. However, grafting of QAS onto GO nanosheets significantly increased the stability and dispersion properties of GO (see Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S4). It seems that the grafted QAS can weaken the interaction force between nanosheets. In addition, gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive to GO-QAS than gram-negative bacteria, since the inhibition zone was much clearer and larger, which might be because both GO and QAS were more effective against gram-positive bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. A previous study reported that the external layers of the gram-negative bacterial cell wall, which is composed of lipopolysaccharides and proteins, can resist penetration of biocides. The cell wall of gram-positive bacteria, which is composed of peptidoglycan layers, can easily be penetrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The plate count results indicated that GO and QAS can kill both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria but with limited antibacterial effect, while GO-QAS nanosheets significantly improved the killing efficiency (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">d</xref>). The bacterial live/dead viability assay results were not only in good accordance with the results obtained with the plate count method but also indicated that bacterial membranes were damaged after incubation with GO, QAS, and GO-QAS, which was further verified by observing cell morphology changes with SEM and measuring the efflux of cytoplasmic constituents (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).</p><p id="Par82">Since we have demonstrated the excellent antibacterial activity of GO-QAS, it was intriguing for us to detect whether the antibacterial activity of GO-QAS is attributed to a synergistic effect of GO and QAS or merely an additive effect of the two constituents mixed together. Bacteria were treated with GO, QAS, a mixture of GO and QAS, or GO-QAS. The antibacterial results (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">f</xref>) showed that GO-QAS exhibited higher antibacterial activity than the mixture of GO and QAS, indicating a synergistic antibacterial effect of GO and QAS. Such results could explain why there is an optimal QAS graft ratio at which GO-QAS exhibits the highest antibacterial activity. The mechanism of the synergistic antibacterial effect may be attributed to the following factors: (1) GO-QAS nanosheets have a much higher local QAS density/concentration on nanosheets compared with QAS solution and therefore could have much stronger antibacterial activity when in contact with bacteria. (2) QAS polymers could work as a surfactant to stabilize GO nanosheets in solution and prevent aggregation, which would improve the GO nanosheet antibacterial performance. (3) Positively charged GO-QAS nanosheets could be more easily adsorbed onto the negatively charged surface of the bacterial membrane through electrostatic interactions. Based on the antibacterial activity of GO, QAS, and GO-QAS, we could roughly calculate the contributions of each component to the antibacterial activity of GO-QAS using the following formula: antibacterial contribution %&#x02009;=&#x02009;individual antibacterial activity/antibacterial activity of GO-QAS &#x000d7;100%. Therefore, for GO-QAS against <italic>E. coli</italic>, the antibacterial contributions of each part were 9% for GO and 67% for QAS. For <italic>S. aureus</italic>, the antibacterial contributions were 10% for GO and 72% for QAS.</p><p id="Par83">Previous research has reported antibacterial activity of GO through membrane disruption and oxidative stress induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and the antimicrobial activity of QAS through cell membrane perturbation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The bacterial live/dead assay results mentioned above indicated that the bacterial cell membrane was compromised after nanocomposite treatments. It was intriguing for us to determine whether GO-QAS shared the same and enhanced antibacterial mechanisms. Because gram-negative bacteria were more resistant to GO-QAS than gram-positive bacteria, we chose <italic>E. coli</italic> to carry out the following antibacterial mechanism experiments. SEM images of bacteria morphology (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) indicated that GO-QAS exhibited the combined antibacterial mechanisms of GO and QAS. These results indicated a synergistic antibacterial effect of GO nanosheets and QAS, because not only did the GO-bacteria interaction contribute to the wrapping of the bacteria membrane with nanosheets, it created opportunities for full contact between grafted QAS and the cell membrane, thus increasing the local concentration of QAS on the bacteria membrane. Additionally, QAS facilitated the dispersion of GO nanosheets, thus making the interaction between GO and bacteria much easier. Moreover, although previous molecular dynamics simulations revealed that GO nanosheets could be spontaneously adsorbed onto a phospholipid membrane by the Van der Waals force [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], the positively charged GO-QAS nanosheets could be more easily adsorbed onto the negatively charged surface of the bacterial membrane through electrostatic interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], thus causing more severe membrane damage. Bacterial membrane disruption was further demonstrated by measuring leakage of cytoplasmic material (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>).</p><p id="Par84">Oxidative stress is a highly recognized antibacterial mechanism of various carbon nanomaterials, such as graphene oxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], fullerene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Oxidative stress could subsequently disturb normal bacterial metabolism and cause protein denaturation, lipid peroxidation, and DNA damage, eventually leading to bacteria death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The results (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8b</xref>) showed that both GO and GO-QAS could enhance the ROS level in bacteria, which corroborated previous literature reporting the antibacterial activity of graphene-based nanomaterials through ROS induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In addition, QAS could also induce ROS production, which might be due to bacterial metabolism disruption after QAS enters the cytoplasm. Remarkably, GO-QAS induced higher ROS levels than GO at the same concentration, which indicated that the functional QAS group on GO could also induce ROS generation. These results revealed that GO-QAS can eradicate bacteria through oxidative stress induction.</p><p id="Par85">After we demonstrated the excellent antibacterial activity of GO-QAS towards both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and revealed the non-specific antibacterial mechanisms of cell membrane disruption and oxidative stress induction, we decided to explore the antimicrobial property of GO-QAS against multidrug-resistant bacteria to determine whether such mechanisms worked against these bacteria. It was found that GO-QAS could significantly eradicate MRSA and MDR-AB (see Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2), which indicated that the non-specific antimicrobial mechanisms (cell membrane disruption and oxidative stress induction) of GO-QAS could also be applicable to multidrug-resistant bacteria.</p><p id="Par86">The excellent antimicrobial properties make it possible for GO-QAS to become a promising antibacterial agent. However, it was essential to demonstrate the biocompatibility of GO-QAS before it is utilized in the biomedical field. The cell viability test results (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9a</xref>) showed that GO-QAS at concentrations lower than 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL showed no obvious cytotoxicity. These results were further demonstrated by the flow cytometry apoptosis assay (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9b</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">d</xref>). The results showed that GO-QAS at concentrations lower than 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL caused no obvious cell apoptosis or necrosis.

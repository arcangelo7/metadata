Neighbouring countries have not yet reported any cases, but preparedness measures to fight the spread of the disease are of vital importance.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://afro.who.int/news/south-sudan-vaccinates-health-workers-against-ebola">https://afro.who.int/news/south-sudan-vaccinates-health-workers-against-ebola</ext-link></p></sec><sec sec-type="other2"><title>WHO rejects collaboration with Philip Morris-funded foundation</title><p>WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus rejected a collaboration proposal from the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World, funded by Philip-Morris International.</p><p>The foundation proposed that WHO &#x0201c;review and consider how best to work with the foundation to facilitate a rapid reduction in the use of lethal cigarettes&#x0201d; in an open letter to the WHO Executive Board which met between 24 January and 1 February.</p><p>Speaking to the Executive Board, the Director-General stated that WHO would not partner with the foundation and recommended that Member States and and their counterparts also refuse to do so.</p><p>&#x0201c;WHO will NOT partner with Philip Morris-funded foundation for a Smoke-Free World nor any other group funded by the tobacco industry. Governments and the public health community should follow this lead&#x0201d; was the message tweeted by @WHO, shortly after his statement.</p><p>The statement repeats the position articulated by WHO in 2017, when the foundation was created.</p><p>The foundation claims to provide grants for &#x0201c;medical, agricultural, and scientific research to end smoking and its health effects and to address the impact of reduced worldwide demand for tobacco.&#x0201d; Philip Morris is introducing a new portfolio of products, including heated tobacco products, into many markets. Research on such products is funded by the foundation.</p><p>The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control&#x02019;s (WHO FCTC) Secretariat has been similarly forthright in its rejection of the foundation, stating that it is a clear attempt to breach the WHO FCTC by interfering in public policy &#x0201c;aimed at damaging the treaty&#x02019;s implementation, particularly through the foundation&#x02019;s contentious research programmes.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec sec-type="other3"><title>Lassa fever in West Africa</title><p>Five countries &#x02013; Benin, Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Togo &#x02013; are reporting outbreaks of Lassa fever. The largest of these outbreaks was affecting 19 states in Nigeria as of 3 February.</p><p>The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control declared an outbreak of Lassa fever on 22 January 2019, and as of 3 February, had reported 275 confirmed positive cases in 19 states, including 57 deaths.</p><p>This represents slightly over a third of the total cases for last year, when Nigeria experienced its worst outbreak of Lassa fever to date. A total of 12 cases had been confirmed as of 3 February in Benin, Guinea, Liberia and Togo, including two deaths, with more suspected cases being investigated.</p><p>&#x0201c;We are concerned by the high number of cases so early in the Lassa fever season, which is expected to last another four more months,&#x0201d; said Dr Ibrahima Soc&#x000e9; Fall, Regional Emergencies Director&#x000a0;at WHO Regional Office for Africa.</p><p>Lassa fever outbreak response is focused on early detection and confirmation of suspected cases, providing optimal supportive care and ensuring infection prevention and control measures in designated health-care facilities in the affected states.</p><p>WHO is supporting the outbreak response coordination, enhanced surveillance, epidemiological analysis and risk communication in all five countries. The organization is also mobilizing experts to support case management and infection prevention and control.</p><p>Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic illness that occurs predominantly in West Africa, after human exposure to the urine or faeces of infected&#x000a0;rats. More than 80% of Lassa fever cases are caused by rodent-to-human transmission of the virus. Prevention relies on promoting good &#x0201c;community hygiene&#x0201d; to discourage rodents from entering homes.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://afro.who.int/news/who-supports-five-countries-fight-lassa-fever-outbreaks">https://afro.who.int/news/who-supports-five-countries-fight-lassa-fever-outbreaks</ext-link></p></sec><sec sec-type="other4"><title>Funding for neglected disease R&#x00026;D rises</title><p>Global funding for basic research and product development for neglected diseases reached US$&#x000a0;3.5 billion in 2017 according to the latest <italic>G-FINDER survey, </italic>which has been tracking<italic/>global investment in innovative research and development for neglected diseases since 2007.</p><p>It was the highest level recorded by the survey apart from the US$&#x000a0;3.7 billion reported in 2015, which was boosted by an investment surge in research and development for viral haemorrhagic fevers.</p><p>Investment in 2017 grew by US$&#x000a0;232 million compared to 2016.

A risk calculator allowing a user to see the benefits of changing one or more risk factors could impact on the perceived benefits of change, while use of the risk calculator could itself be a cue to action.</p><p>Before a risk calculator can have these potential impacts, users first need to understand and make sense of the information in the risk calculator, and accept that the information is personally relevant. This sense of personal relevance includes agreeing that the &#x02018;disease X&#x02019; is potentially serious and worth avoiding. Second, users have to be convinced that the benefits the calculator suggests can be achieved, in terms of avoiding &#x02018;disease X&#x02019;, are significant, and worth the effort required to achieve change. Unwanted impacts are also possible. Users could be demotivated if they felt that the benefits achieved by change were not worth the effort, made increasingly anxious or depressed about their health, or feel disempowered about their ability to influence health outcomes.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>The empirical data on use of risk calculators by patients are sparse and unconvincing. Randomised controlled trials suggest that although presenting risk to patients can have a small impact on the accuracy of risk perception and on intention to change, there is little or no impact on behavioural outcomes or overall risk.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> In view of this uncertainty, this study was conducted to explore user reactions to a cardiovascular risk calculator for people with type 2 diabetes. The study aimed at identifying users&#x02019; cognitive and emotional reactions to the presentation of risk, with a view to understanding whether and how such a calculator could help motivate patients with type 2 diabetes to adopt healthier behaviours and/or improve adherence to medication.</p><boxed-text position="float"><sec><title>How this fits in</title><p>Risk calculators are increasingly used to estimate individual patient&#x02019;s cardiovascular risk and guide management. It has been argued that providing patients with individualised calculations of global cardiovascular risk could promote healthy behaviours and improved self-management; however, trial data do not support this hypothesis. This study explores the responses of patients with type 2 diabetes to an interactive, personalised cardiovascular risk calculator. Awareness of these responses may help GPs and practice nurses who wish to use risk calculators as a motivational intervention in consultations.</p></sec></boxed-text></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHOD</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Design</title><p>This was a qualitative study combining data from focus groups and individual user experience, &#x02018;think-aloud&#x02019;, and semi-structured interviews.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants and recruitment</title><p>Adults with type 2 diabetes were recruited through advertisements on the Diabetes UK website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.diabetes.org.uk">www.diabetes.org.uk</ext-link>; the UK&#x02019;s leading diabetes charity), black, minority and ethnic health forum (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="bmehf.org.uk">bmehf.org.uk</ext-link>), local council websites, and posters displayed at local GP practices and diabetes groups.

Data were analysed by a multidisciplinary group, including experienced qualitative researchers with backgrounds in general practice, health psychology, and sociology, and expertise in e-health.</p><p>Analytical methods were selected according to the purpose of each wave of data collection. Thus, focus group data were analysed using a framework approach, with an emphasis on obtaining practically useful information to help the team decide whether to pursue the development of a risk calculator, which modifiable risk factors should ideally be included in the risk calculator (although not all parameters requested by users could be included as high quality cohort or RCT data were not available), and how the risk information should be presented. Usability testing informed revision of the navigation and layout of the risk calculator and outputs. Finally, the think-aloud and semi-structured interviews were subjected to thematic analysis. Transcripts were read and re-read by three investigators, with selected transcripts read by three additional investigators. Emergent themes were discussed in data clinics, and transcripts were coded. The coding framework from these interviews was then applied to the focus group transcripts and usability testing. Every effort was made to identify disconfirming data that did not fit with emergent themes. The final analysis was agreed by the six investigators who read the transcripts.</p><p>Illustrative quotes in the results are identified by initial (FG = focus group, UT = user testing, II = individual interviews) followed by a number and key demographic information.

Unsurprisingly, where the calculator estimates were more optimistic than users&#x02019; pre-existing beliefs, they initially found this encouraging and cheering. Users whose pre-existing beliefs were more optimistic than the information presented by the calculator became worried and anxious:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;So yes, I did feel quite encouraged that it wasn&#x02019;t as dire as I&#x02019;d thought, because to be honest, when I saw those levels, I thought to myself, oh, I&#x02019;m looking at having complications in the next few years.

This was particularly apparent when users had expected a better risk profile. Users had complex personal health beliefs, which incorporated family history, personal experience, and actions already taken to improve health. They used these to explain why the calculated risk or changes in risk were not relevant to them personally.

Participants tended to see these as treatable events, which could be survived without having too much adverse effect on quality of life. Many participants were much more concerned by the possibility of losing their sight, developing painful leg ulcers, or becoming disabled in some other way. Similarly, for many of the participants, the duration of their remaining life was less important than the quality of life. None of the participants reported viewing heart attack or stroke as a marker for other outcomes that may have been more personally relevant:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;This was focused on heart attack and strokes it didn&#x02019;t seem to be related to &#x02026; But, certainly that would have been of interest, if I could reduce the risk of losing my sight and losing a limb, that would certainly be very motivating for me, you know. I mean, heart attack or stroke is not really on my agenda. Whether it&#x02019;s on anybody else&#x02019;s agenda, probably, I don&#x02019;t know.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(II 106, 72 years, male)</attrib></disp-quote></p></sec><sec><title>Perceived benefits and barriers to action</title><p>Many participants were already aware of the importance of weight control and physical activity in staying healthy and tended to be comfortable altering estimates for weight, physical activity, or smoking. Altering HbA1c, blood pressure, or lipid levels was often challenging, however, as participants tended not to know what sort of levels they should be aiming for with these parameters, and often were uncertain about whether their own results were &#x02018;good&#x02019; or not. To enable participants to see maximal benefits of change, if asked, the interviewer provided suggestions for a reasonable range of numbers to enter.</p><p>Different users reacted differently to changes in risk estimates; changes that seemed small to one person were viewed as highly significant by another. Some users were clearly motivated by the visual display linking outcomes to risk factors, such as this 49-year-old male:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;When I started fiddling about with the blood pressure, reducing the blood pressure down from what it was down to what it is now, just shows that, yes, you can do stuff, what I&#x02019;m doing is right, that&#x02019;s fantastically encouraging and makes you feel really good&#x02019;.</p><attrib>(II 108, 49 years, male)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>Many users found the perceived benefit to be small, however, particularly in response to changes in weight or physical activity:
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;No, that&#x02019;s the one, that&#x02019;s the one that I can change. If I change that</italic> [exercise 4 hours a week] <italic>to yes. 1.2 years. It&#x02019;s quite a low return for quite a major effort it seems to me.&#x02019;</italic></p><attrib>(II 106, 70 years, male)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>In general, participants felt that healthy life gains of less than a year were irrelevant:
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;I can have another year, that&#x02019;s not much. I don&#x02019;t consider that a major incentive, really&#x02019;</italic>.</p><attrib>(II 109, 55 years, female)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>Some users found the whole exercise demotivating:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;You just get the sort of hopelessness feeling where it doesn&#x02019;t matter what you do, it&#x02019;s going to slowly get worse and then it&#x02019;ll kill you, which is what I hear all the time&#x02019;.</p><attrib>(II 108, 49 years, male)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>Linked to the concept of effort in achieving change was the concept of control. Whereas weight and physical activity were seen as under their control, many participants saw HbA1c, lipids, and blood pressure to be factors for which their doctor was responsible:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;There&#x02019;s three things to the treatment: the medication, the diet, and the exercise. And I&#x02019;ve got control over two of those three things and I don&#x02019;t believe the medication does much &#x02026;&#x02019;</p><attrib>(II 109, 55 years, female)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>In contrast, some participants found the impact of changes in blood pressure or cholesterol highly motivating, and helped them overcome any antipathy to taking tablets:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;I can do something about the blood pressure which is why I was very interested in it, I can take the tablets. Is it worth taking them?

There was a widespread perception that access to this information would enable users to make informed choices and would be motivating. As this focus group user said:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;And although it may be only a year&#x02019;s difference, there were half a dozen things where you could make a year&#x02019;s difference, and that starts, I mean you can see where your priorities should be.

<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;Oh yes, I think it&#x02019;s the sort of thing that would be particularly useful to somebody who&#x02019;s perhaps not behaving themselves, and are outside all the tolerances, and it might actually go to underline it&#x02019;s not just Nurse Naggy sort of thing.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(II 101, 68 years, male)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>Many participants felt it would be best used with a nurse or doctor, however, who could help the user enter correct values, and explain the implications of the various outputs:

The complexity and range of these reactions go a long way to explaining the apparent lack of impact of presenting personalised risk estimates to individuals in terms of changing modifiable risk factors. Despite the use of best practice in presenting risk, many users found the information confusing and hard to understand. The information triggered strong emotional reactions, and where the emotions triggered were negative or uncomfortable, this often led to discounting the information provided. Global cardiovascular risk was often not seen as a personally relevant outcome, and reductions in risk from behavioural modification or taking medication were not always motivating as the benefits were perceived as small. Despite this, users reported being pleased they had had the opportunity to use the calculator, and were keen that other people with diabetes should have similar opportunities, particularly if the calculator could be used with a health professional to help make sense of the outputs.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This study has many strengths, including combining different qualitative methods, including user testing and think-aloud interviews. These methods provided &#x02018;real-time&#x02019; data and minimised the amount of self-censoring or social desirability bias. The intervention was clinically relevant to all the participants as their risk information was based on their own clinical data. Hence, participants were not being asked to consider their responses to a hypothetical situation. Data were analysed by a multidisciplinary team.</p><p>The major limitation to the data is that by definition, the participants were interested in self-management of their diabetes, as they responded to advertisements for people with diabetes to help develop and improve online self-management tools. Hence, many of the participants were already knowledgeable about diabetes, and felt that they had already taken considerable steps to improve their health. Despite this, many of the users were surprised to find they had average or above average levels of risk compared with other people with diabetes, suggesting that many of the study findings may transfer to patients less actively involved in self-management. Another consequence of the method of recruitment was that all except one of the participants described themselves as &#x02018;experienced&#x02019; or &#x02018;expert&#x02019; internet users. It is possible that less experienced users may have found the risk calculator even harder to understand and navigate than these relatively experienced users. Some patients had difficulty in obtaining their clinical data from their GP, and many found it hard to alter clinical parameters such as HbA1c or cholesterol, as they had little idea of appropriate ranges. This could be addressed in future versions of the calculator by providing guidance on appropriate ranges in the right-hand panel.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with existing literature</title><p>The present study data support and build on previous literature in this field. The findings on the need for multiple formats for presentation of risk information agree with established best practice. The tendency to derogate or discount information that undermines an individual&#x02019;s emotional wellbeing is also well documented,<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and there are techniques for minimising this effect, such as encouraging users to engage in a positive self-affirmation before accessing such information.<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> It is hard, however, to see how these techniques could be routinely applied with a web-based risk calculator that users are free to use when and how they choose.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Implications for research and practice</title><p>The study data suggest that, at present, cardiovascular risk calculators for people with diabetes may be best used in conjunction with health professionals who can guide the user through the calculator, ensure accurate data entry, and help use the resulting risk information as a source of motivation and encouragement. Consideration was made of removing the risk calculator from the HeLP-Diabetes intervention, but the users urged against doing this, therefore additional text was added with advice to use the calculator with clinical support. Further research is needed on how best to help users not only understand the information generated, but also to process it in a way that is constructive or helpful, so that initial anxiety or distress can be harnessed to help achieve change rather than result in demotivation or hopelessness. It is also worth acknowledging that benefits considered highly worthwhile at population or public health level may not be seen as significant by individuals. It is important to acknowledge the validity of this difference in perspective which may well lead to informed individuals making decisions about their health care or health behaviours at odds with current clinical guidance.<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to all our participants without whom the study would not have been possible, Orla O&#x02019;Donnell and Vanessa Hack for project management, and Softforge for development of HeLP-Diabetes.</p></ack><notes><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This article presents independent research funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)&#x02019;s Programme Grants for Applied Research Programme (Grant Reference Number RP-PG-0609&#x02013;10135).

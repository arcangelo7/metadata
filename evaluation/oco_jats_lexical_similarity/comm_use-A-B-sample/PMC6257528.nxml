with respiratory distress syndrome. This condition is often related to
barotrauma caused by mechanical ventilation or continuous positive airway
pressure applied to low birth weight neonates. The clinical diagnosis can be
challenging. However, after proper diagnosis, several interventions are
available for successful management. We describe an infant who developed severe
PIE with recurrent pneumothoraces and development of a persistent bronchopleural
fistula shortly after repair of a hypoplastic aortic arch and description of
successful lobectomy with the assistance of extracorporeal support (ECMO).</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation</kwd><kwd>Infant, Newborn, Diseases</kwd><kwd>Pulmonary Emphysema</kwd><kwd>Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn</kwd><kwd>Aorta, Thoracic/Abnormalities/Surgery</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><table-wrap id="t1" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" style="background-color:#e6e7e8"><colgroup span="1"><col width="50%" span="1"/><col width="50%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Abbreviations, acronyms &#x00026; symbols</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BPF</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">= Bronchopleural fistula</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ECMO</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">= Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HFOV</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">= High frequency oscillatory ventilation</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PIE</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">= Pulmonary interstitial emphysema</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">POD</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">= Postoperative day</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SVT</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">= Supraventricular tachycardia</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec><title>CASE REPORT</title><p>The patient was born at 38 weeks of gestation via C-section delivery due to prolonged
labor. Prenatal history was notable for a fetal echocardiogram, which demonstrated a
moderately dilated and hypertrophied right ventricle and a hypoplastic aortic arch.
The fetus had episodes of narrow complex tachycardia with heart rate ranging from
180-305 bpm. There was no evidence of hydrops. Postnatally, an electrocardiogram
demonstrated periods of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT); and, an echocardiogram
confirmed the presence of a hypoplastic aortic arch, mildly hypoplastic left
ventricle, and secundum atrial septal defect. Prostaglandin infusion was started to
maintain ductal patency. The next day, the patient developed ectopic atrial rhythm,
which was followed by recurrent episodes of SVT with a heart rate in the 300s; the
last episode required acute administration of adenosine and prevention of subsequent
episodes was achieved with propranolol. On the fourth day of life, he underwent
repair of his hypoplastic aortic arch by homograft patch enlargement and primary
closure of his ASD &#x02013; total cardiopulmonary bypass time was 153 minutes, and
cross-clamp time was 90 minutes. After separation from bypass, the lung compliance
was relatively poor - necessitating high inspiratory pressures. The hyper-inflated
lungs led to leaving the chest open, followed by delayed closure on the third
postoperative day (POD). A few hours postoperatively, the patient again had episodes
of SVT: at this time, suspicion arose of a concealed Wolff-Parkinson-White pathway,
which was managed with an amiodarone drip with eventual addition of flecainide.</p><p>Postoperatively, the lung compliance improved: on POD 8, mediastinal and pleural
chest tubes were removed. Immediately after, the patient developed left-sided
tension pneumothorax, which was treated by insertion of a pigtail catheter. A second
chest tube was required the following day due to a recurrent left pneumothorax with
persistent air leak. The patient was placed on high frequency oscillatory
ventilation (HFOV) to reduce peak and mean airway pressures. A computed tomography
of the chest was consistent with pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE) of the left
upper lobe with an associated bronchopleural fistula (BPF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). Due to repeated pneumothoraces with conservative
management, we proceeded with left upper lobectomy to control the fistula.
Preoperatively, the patient was placed in the right lateral decubitus position,
simulating the planned surgical procedure, which resulted in inadequate ventilation
despite adjustment of mechanical support.</p><p><fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Transverse computed tomography displaying left upper lobe pulmonary
emphysema (white arrow).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-33-05-0528-g01"/></fig></p><p>Due to the patient's hemodynamic lability, we attempted to insert a veno-venous
cannula into the jugular vein; however, the vessel was too small to accept the
smallest cannula. As such, a single lumen venous line was inserted and secured and
carotid cannula was inserted for full support. A left posterolateral thoracotomy was
made, and the fourth intercostal space was entered. After inspection of the lung, a
clear demarcation where the upper lobe had multiple cysts and lingula, as well as
evidence of emphysema were noted. The upper lobe pulmonary vein was carefully
exposed as was the upper lobe pulmonary artery; however, we felt that an anatomic
resection would be too prolonged given the patient's tenuous condition. As such, two
staple lines were applied across the division point between the upper lobe and the
lingula taking care to avoid injury to the superior vein or the pulmonary artery. A
second application of staples allowed removal of the involved upper lobe. The left
upper lobectomy and pleural tent successfully controlled the BPF. Histologic
inspection of the lung demonstrated numerous cysts localized to the left upper lobe
with sparing of the remaining left lung parenchyma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). A BPF was demonstrated originating from the anteromedial
segment of the upper lobe.</p><p><fig id="f2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Hematoxylin and eosin-stained left upper lobe lung sections showing

extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) on post-lobectomy day 6. On
post-lobectomy day 21, patient transitioned to conventional ventilator and was
extubated. He has done well 8 months postoperatively without respiratory symptoms,
need for supplemental oxygen, or tachyarrhythmias.</p></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION </title><p>Prematurity and low birth weight (&#x0003c;1500 grams) are known risk factors for
developing PIE; the perivascular connective tissue in the lung is more abundant in
preterm infants, which allows for air trapping in the perivascular space<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Infants who suffer from PIE are at risk for developing other pulmonary complications
such as BPF with persistent air leak and compromised ventilation due to compression
of healthy lung parenchyma by large bullae<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Different treatment approaches have been developed:
conservative and surgical interventions. Conservative measures consist of
ventilation, positioning, selective intubation, and steroids - HFOV can be used
successfully, as was used in our case<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In situations where conservative management fails, surgery can be curative if the
disease involves a segment of lung that can be removed without major pulmonary
complications for the newborn. In our case, PIE involved only the left upper lobe,
and left upper lobectomy was curative.</p><p>In our case, the patient was not premature and had a normal preoperative pulmonary
status with no respiratory compromise. He developed severe PIE of his left upper
lobe shortly after his aortic arch repair. When we noticed lung compliance was
suboptimal at the end of the case, we suspected high mean airway pressures caused
PIE. The chest was left open in an effort to improve chest mechanics and allow for
better lung expansion. The use of ECMO was then used as a bridge for a safe left
upper lobectomy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Performing a lobectomy with the successful assistance of ECMO is infrequent. Lung
resection, with or without extracorporeal support, should be a viable alternative in
patients with persistent isolated PIE, especially those that have suffered
complications such as pneumothorax, or persistent air leak.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="50%" span="1"/><col width="50%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MM</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Substantial contributions to the conception or design

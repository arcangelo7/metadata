technique and long-term outcomes of our patients with cardiac myxoma who underwent
surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We retrospectively collected data of patients with cardiac myxoma who underwent
surgical resection between February 1990 and November 2014. Biatrial approach is the
preferred surgical method in a large proportion of patients that are operated due to
left atrial myxoma because it provides wider exposure than the uniatrial approach. To
prevent recurrence during surgical resection, a large excision is made so as to include
at least 5 mm of normal area from clean tissue around the tumor. Moreover, special
attention is paid to the excision that is made as a whole, without digesting the
fragment of tumor with gentle dissections.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Forty-three patients (20 males, mean age of 51.7&#x000b1;8.8 years) were included. Most
common symptom was dyspnea (48.8%). Tumor was located in the left atrium in 37 (86%)
patients. Resections were achieved via biatrial approach in 34 patients, uniatrial
approach in 8 patients, and right atriotomy with right ventriculotomy in 1 patient. One
patient died due to low cardiac output syndrome in the early postoperative period. Mean
follow-up time was 102.3&#x000b1;66.5 months. Actuarial survival rates were 95%, 92% and
78% at five, 10 and 15 years, respectively. Recurrence was observed in none of the
patients during follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although myxomas are benign tumors, due to embolic complications and obstructive signs,
they should be treated surgically as soon as possible after diagnosis. To prevent
recurrence, especially in cardiac myxomas which are located in left atrium, preferred
biatrial approach is suggested for wide resection of the tumor and to avoid residual
tumor.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Myxoma</kwd><kwd>Cardiac Surgical Procedures, Methods</kwd><kwd>Death, Sudden, Cardiac</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><table-wrap id="t4" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" style="background-color:#e6e7e8"><colgroup span="1"><col width="10%" span="1"/><col width="90%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Abbreviations, acronyms &#x00026; symbols</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">AF</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;= Atrial fibrillation</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">IABP</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;= Intraaortic balloon pump</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ICU</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;= Intensive care unit</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NYHA</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;= New York Heart Association</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TEE</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;= Transesophageal echocardiography</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TTE</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;= Transthoracic echocardiography</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Primary cardiac tumors are rare neoplasms with an autopsy incidence between 0.001% and
0.3%<sup>[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. Approximately 75-80% of primary cardiac tumors are benign, and of
those, more than half are myxomas<sup>[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. Myxomas occur in all age groups, but are more
likely to present between the third and sixth decades of life. Myxomas are predominantly
present in females and, in the majority of patients, they originate from the region of fossa
ovalis of interatrial septum in the left atrium<sup>[<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Although myxomas are histologically benign, this type of tumor carries the risk of systemic
embolization with subsequent cerebral or peripheral infarctions, intracardiac obstructions,
syncope, and sudden death<sup>[<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. Therefore, surgical treatment for cardiac
myxomas should be performed as soon as possible after diagnosis. The basic principles of
surgical treatment for cardiac myxomas include complete wide excision of tumor and avoidance
of residual tumor. However, the most appropriate surgical approach especifically for left
atrial myxomas is controversial.</p><p>We aimed to present clinical features, surgical approaches, importance of surgical
technique and long-term outcomes of patients with cardiac myxoma who underwent surgery in
this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>From February 1990 to November 2014, a total of 65 patients were operated due to primary
cardiac tumors in our institution. Of those, 43 patients had undergone surgery for cardiac
myxoma. In this study, the patients who had undergone surgical resection for cardiac myxoma
were included in the study and their records were reviewed retrospectively. The study
protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Uludag University.
As this was a retrospective study involving routine cardiac surgical procedures, informed
patient consent was not required; however, the approval for screening of patient files was
obtained from the Ethics Committee.</p><sec><title>Preoperative Evaluation and Diagnosis</title><p>In the presence of clinical suspicion of a diagnosis of cardiac tumor, diagnostic studies
were initiated. Preoperative diagnosis was established in all patients by two-dimensional
transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was performed
in patients whose diagnosis was doubtful on TTE. Furthermore, TEE was routinely performed
intraoperatively to inspect all four cardiac chambers. In some cases, additional computed
tomographic scanning and magnetic resonance imaging were performed to obtain the
diagnosis. Coronary angiography was performed if the patient had a history of chest pain
or was older than 40 years old. Preoperative routine laboratory investigations in myxoma
patients consisted of full blood count and blood biochemistry, including erythrocyte
sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Surgical Technique</title><p>An operation was performed in all cases as soon as possible after diagnosis of cardiac
myxomas was established. Surgical resection was performed through a median sternotomy
incision in all cases. Cardiopulmonary bypass was conducted with aorticbicaval
cannulation, mild or moderate systemic hypothermia, aortic cross-clamping, and antegrade
cardioplegic cardiac arrest. Manipulation of the heart before the aortic cross-clamping
was minimized in deference to the known friability and embolic tendency of myxomas. If the
tumor is in the typical location in the left atrium, left ventricular venting through the
left superior pulmonary vein is not performed, to avoid dislodging tumor material. There
was no requirement for deep hypothermic circulatory arrest in any of the cases with right
atrial myxoma.</p><p>The surgical approach was selected according to the localization and size of myxoma, the
preference and experience of the surgeon, the presence of concomitant cardiac diseases,
and the genetic nature of the myxoma. A standard right atriotomy approach was performed
for all of the right atrial myxoma cases. A right atriotomy with right ventriculotomy was
performed for only one right atrial plus right ventricular myxoma case.</p><p>The surgical approaches for left atrial myxomas were divided into two groups, according
to the number of opened atrial chambers: uniatrial and biatrial. The uniatrial approach
for left atrial myxomas was classical left atriotomy. The biatrial approach group included
patients who underwent right atrial transseptal approach, biatriotomy, and superior
transseptal approach. With the uniatrial approach, preoperative and intraoperative
echographic confirmation of the absence of contralateral myxoma was obtained. With the
biatrial approach, both atria and ventricles were carefully inspected for tumor fragments
or other myxomas. The uniatrial approach was preferred in a few patients with left atrial
myxoma, who had particularly small tumors. The biatrial approach was the preferred form of
surgery in a large proportion of the patients that were operated on due to left atrial
myxoma because it provides wider exposure than the uniatrial approach.</p><p>The main objective of resection was complete excision of the tumor together with removal
of the attachment base in order to prevent recurrence, with a full-thickness resection in
all of the cases. However, in few cases, subendocardial intramural resection was utilized
when a full-thickness resection would have led to disruption of structural or functional
integrity.</p><p>The right atrial transseptal approach involved an oblique right atriotomy to approach the
interatrial septum and incise the fossa ovalis initially at the limbus to expose the
myxoma. The exposure through this incision in the interatrial septum was facilitated
further by using small retractors and, if required, by applying gentle pressure to the
lateral wall of the left atrium. The biatriotomy approach involved a longitudinal incision
on the left atrial wall, posterior to the interatrial groove, and a counter incision on
the right atrial wall. The right atrial incision is standard, approximately 1 cm parallel
to the atrioventricular groove. This exposure usually results in adequate immediate
visualization of the tumor. The superior transseptal approach involved an incision on
right atrial mid-lateral wall, extending anteriorly through the midline of the right
atrial appendage, then posteriorly down the back of the appendage to the superior end of
the interatrial septum. The fossa ovalis was visualized and the interatrial septum was
incised. The incision was extended cephalad to join the previous incision at the superior
end of the septum. The left atrial dome was entered at the junction of the two previous
incisions. The entire tumor mass, the attachment of the pedicle of the myxoma, as well as
the mitral valve annulus were visualized clearly through these surgical approaches. Then,
the tumor and its attachment was widely removed, taking care not to injure the mitral
annulus, the area of conduction tissue, and the tricuspid annulus. In some cases, when the
tumor was larger, gentle pressure to the right ventricular outflow tract area was applied
to aid in exposing the stalk of the tumor. In order to avoid recurrence, a wide resection
was carried out so as to include at least 5 mm normal area from clean tissue around the
tumor. In addition, especial attention was paid to the excision that was made as a whole
without digesting the tumor fragments, with minimal manipulation and gentle dissections.
All cardiac chambers were meticulously inspected in order to avoid residual tumor
fragments. The chambers were copiously irrigated with cold saline solution to eliminate
any loose fragments that may have dislodged during the removal of the tumor. The
surgically created atrial septal defects were repaired by direct suture or using a
pericardial or Dacron patch (C.R. Bard Inc., Murray Hill, NJ, USA). De-airing and the
remainder of the procedure were completed in the standard fashion.</p></sec><sec><title>Histopathological Examination</title><p>All resected tumors were sent to histopathological examination, and the diagnosis of
myxoma was confirmed in all cases. Histopathological examination revealed proliferations
of capillaries, blood extravasations, and disseminated fibrin deposition. These findings
were consistent with the diagnosis of a myxoma.</p></sec><sec><title>Follow-Up Data</title><p>All patients were followed up on an outpatient basis at regular intervals. Clinical
examination, chest radiographs, electrocardiography and TTE were performed routinely at
each follow-up visit. The first visit was performed after discharge, at the latest within
3 months postoperatively; then, the other follow-up visits were performed routinely every
year. Telephone interviews were required for 5 patients with follow-up visits in excess of
12 months or for those who missed the ambulatory follow-up. Three of the patients in this
study were lost to followup after being discharged.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS version 15.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA) software. The data were calculated as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation
for continuous variables and as numbers with percentages for categorical variables. The
long-term cumulative survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Clinical and demographic data of patients are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>. The study group was comprised of 23 female and 20 male patients, with a
mean age of 51.7&#x000b1;8.8 (range: 22&#x02013;76) years at the time of operation. The most common
symptoms at admission were: dyspnea (48.8%), palpitation (37.2%), and chest pain (20.9%).
Furthermore, the constitutional symptoms and signs of a generalized disease such as fever,
fatigue and weight loss were common, being observed in 34.9% of the patients. Nine (20.9%)
patients also showed symptoms of systemic embolization, either to the central or peripheral
nervous system. Seven (16.3%) patients were asymptomatic. The mean duration of symptoms was
4.4&#x000b1;2.8 (range: 1&#x02013;12) months. On physical examination, systolic murmur was audible in
13 patients and diastolic murmur in 4. Three patients had the so-called characteristic
diastolic "tumor plop". Ten (23.3%) patients had a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 6
patients (13.9%) had a high C-reactive Protein level, and anemia was present in 4 (9.3%)
patients preoperatively. None of the patients had a familial myxoma nor Carney complex
syndrome.</p><table-wrap id="t1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Clinical and demographic data of patients.</p></caption><table frame="hsides"

0.3% of all open heart surgeries<sup>[<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>. Myxomas are the most common primary cardiac
tumors. The &#x0fb01;rst successful resection of a cardiac tumor was a case with a left atrial
myxoma reported by Crafoord, in 1954<sup>[<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>.
Nowadays, the surgical treatment of cardiac myxoma carries a low operative risk and is
associated with excellent short and long-term outcomes in many cardiac surgery centers.</p><p>Myxomas are neoplasms of multipotent mesenchymal cells in the subendocardial tissue. The
precise histogenetic origin has not been identified<sup>[<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>. Histologically, the so-called myxoma cells are predominant. These
polygonal, occasionally multinucleate, cells have an eosinophilic cytoplasm and are
surrounded by a myxoid stroma. Degenerative changes such as cystic formations, hemorrhages,
fibroses, and calcifications occur, as well as gland formation (lithomyxoma)<sup>[<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Cardiac myxomas usually occur in adults, most often between the third and sixth decades of
life, and are predominantly present in females<sup>[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. In our series, 23 (53.5%) patients were female, with a mean age of
51.7 years at the time of operation.</p><p>Myxomas may present with a wide spectrum of symptoms, from being completely asymptomatic to
life-threatening catastrophic consequences. The structure, size and localization of the
tumor are the most significant determinants of symptoms and outcomes. Most patients present
with one or more of the triad of intracardiac obstruction, cerebral or peripheral embolisms,
and constitutional symptoms and signs. Thus, the diagnosis usually requires physician
suspicion. Incidental diagnosis during operation, autopsy studies, or routine
echocardiographic examination for other purposes is not uncommon. In general, there are no
specific physical examinations and/or laboratory findings related to myxomas. An
auscultation finding, a "tumor plop" sound, which is an early diastolic murmur due to
penetrating myxoma into the ventricle, is considered pathognomonic<sup>[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>. The symptoms may be intermittent, resulting
from occasional prolapse of pedunculated and mobile tumors through the atrioventricular
valves into the ventricle. Valvular obstruction may cause dyspnea, arrhythmias, precordial
uneasiness, syncope, heart failure, acute pulmonary edema and sudden death. The level of
atrioventricular valve obstruction depends on the site and size of the tumor. It may change
depending on the position of the body. In patients with left atrial myxomas, the symptoms of
left-sided heart failure, such as dyspnea on exertion, may progress to orthopnea, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea or pulmonary edema because of the obstruction at the mitral valve orifice.
Systemic embolization may occur due to the friability of the tumor itself. The embolic
symptoms are often nonspecific and minor embolic events such as transient visual loss and
transient loss of consciousness are often overlooked. The most distressing is the
embolization to the brain vessels, resulting in transient ischemic attack, reversible
ischemic neurologic deficit or stroke, and persistent neurologic deficit both pre- and
intraoperatively. The embolization is not related to the size of the myxoma and may occur
with very small-sized tumors even before mechanical intervention occurs. The constitutional
symptoms and signs are fever, fatigue, weakness, weight loss, anemia, arthralgia, and
myalgia. Some investigations have revealed that it is associated with an immunologic basis,
especially with high values of interleukin-6 in plasma<sup>[<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>. In addition, unknown
factors may also affect this phenomenon. In our series, the most common symptom was dyspnea,
observed in 48.8% of the patients. The other common symptoms were palpitation (37.2%), chest
pain (20.9%), and constitutional symptoms (34.9%). Additionally, 20.9% of the patients had a
history of systemic embolization and 16.3% of the patients were asymptomatic.</p><p>Cardiac myxomas may be localized on any cardiac chamber or structure; however, in every
publication in the literature, the most common site of myxoma has been stated as being in
the left atrium, with the tumor base on the interatrial septum<sup>[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>. Myxomas may also
arise from the right atrium, the ventricles, the atrioventricular valves, or may even
originate from the atrial or ventricular free wall or appendages<sup>[<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>-<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup>. In our series, we
observed the myxoma was located in the left atrium in 86% of the patients. In 12% and 2% of
the patients, the myxoma was located in right atrium and in both right atrium and right
ventricle, respectively.</p><p>Diagnosis of cardiac myxomas is usually possible by TTE, with a detection rate of 95.2%.
TTE often defines the location, size, shape, attachment, and mobility of the tumor. In cases
where there is doubt or image quality is not optimal, TEE may be the next choice of
diagnostic tool<sup>[<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup>. Coronary angiography must be performed if coronary artery
disease is suspected or the patient is older than 40 years old<sup>[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>. Computed tomographic scanning and cardiac magnetic resonance
imaging produce high resolution images of the heart. Both can provide additional information
regarding the extent of tumor within the heart or into adjacent extracardiac structures and
may help in making further distinctions. Contrast enhancement can be used to differentiate
tumors from thrombi since thrombi do not usually show enhancement and fat-suppression
techniques may further define tumors such as lipomas<sup>[<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup>. Finally, these techniques provide well definition of lesions prior to
any surgical intervention.</p><p>When a diagnosis of cardiac myxoma has been established, prompt surgical treatment should
be performed without delay because of the high risk of sudden death from thromboembolism or
valvular obstruction. The basic principles of surgical treatment for cardiac myxomas include
complete resection of the tumor to avoid intraoperative embolization and the presence of
residual tumor. Special care must be taken to avoid intraoperative embolization of the
myxoma. Manipulation of the heart before the aortic cross-clamping must be minimized to
avoid the risk of embolization. Adequate resection with negative clear margins is the
cornerstone of tumor resection to avoid the risk of recurrence. The tumor must be removed
with a 0.5-1 cm margin of tissue<sup>[<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup>.
Sometimes extensive resections may be required and, in such cases, a remnant defect may be
reconstructed with a patch. However, removal of the tumors at the vicinity of the conduction
tissue or on the atrioventricular valves can be technically difficult and very risky.
Limited resection confined to the subendocardial level, rather than big tissue removal, may
be inevitable. In these patients, close follow-up is necessary to rule out possible
recurrence. Furthermore, copious irrigation of all cardiac chambers must be applied to
remove small tumor particles after resection of myxoma<sup>[<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>-<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup>. Therefore, it is important
to choose the appropriate surgical approach to the myxomas. The surgical approach to the
myxomas should allow minimal manipulation of the tumor, provide adequate exposure for its
complete resection, enable inspection of all four cardiac chambers, minimize recurrence, and
be safe and effective<sup>[<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The surgical approach to the myxomas may vary according to localization of the tumor. For
resection of a right atrial myxoma, classical right atriotomy is the generally accepted
approach. For resection of a left atrial myxoma, there are generally two approaches:
uniatrial and biatrial. However, the ideal surgical approach to left atrial myxomas is still
controversial and a consensus regarding the surgical approach has not been reached. We
preferred the biatrial approach that includes biatriotomy, right atrial transseptal approach
and superior transseptal approach for the left atrial myxomas in a large proportion of
patients (92%) because it provides some advantages over the uniatrial approach.</p><p>The biatrial approach to the myxomas was popularized by Kabbani &#x00026; Cooley, in
1973<sup>[<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup>. To prevent incomplete
removal and recurrence, complete eradication of the base of implantation is necessary, and
the biatrial approach offers an excellent visualization of the left and right cavities
allowing easy manipulation of the tumor<sup>[<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup>. Jones et al.<sup>[<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup>
defined the advantages of the biatrial approach as being: i) definition of tumor pedicle by
direct visualization, ii) minimal manipulation of the tumor, iii) adequate margins of
excision, iv) inspection of all heart chambers, and v) secure closure of the atrial septal
defect<sup>[<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup>. Although the biatrial
approach offers an excellent exposure, it has been criticized as being responsible for a
high incidence of arrhythmias and conduction disturbances after the resection of left atrial
myxomas<sup>[<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</sup>. In our experience, no malignant arrhythmias were observed after
surgery. Only AF occurred postoperatively as rhythm disturbance in 7 (16%) cases. AF was
present preoperatively in three of the 7 cases with postoperative AF, and the other 4 cases
with new-onset AF were succesfully converted to sinus rhythm medically. Furthermore, there
was no correlation between the type of approach and the incidence of new-onset AF (one case
with new-onset AF had uniatrial approach).</p><p>The biatrial approach was accepted as the classical approach; however, some studies which
compare biatrial and uniatrial approaches have shown that an uniatrial incision is adequate
to achieve similar outcomes<sup>[<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</sup>. Advocates of the uniatrial approach consider
the exposure to be adequate and have demonstrated the low recurrence rates and safety with
this approach. Interestingly, 34-85% had a subendocardial, not fullthickness resection of
the interatrially based tumor. Nevertheless, there were no large patient series in those
studies<sup>[<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]</sup>. The uniatrial approach to left atrial myxomas is often inadequate,
especially for large-sized tumors, because it requires excessive manipulation of the mass
and, depending on the size of the tumor, may prevent adequate excisional margins to be
obtained. Furthermore, this approach prevents inspection of all four cardiac
chambers<sup>[<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]</sup>. In our opinion, it is
for those reasons that an uniatrial approach may fail to meet required surgical principles
of left atrial myxoma resection. In our experience, we used the uniatrial approach to the
left atrial myxomas in only 3 cases, with a small tumor arising from the left atrial
posterior wall.</p><p>In a recent and intriguing study, Siminelakis et al.<sup>[<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]</sup> defined the ideal approach for the myxomas as being right atrial or
both atrial incision with excision of the fossa ovalis and the surrounding tissues and
closure with a pericardial patch, and the worst approach as the one through the left atrium,
because the technique does not allow us to see properly the base and the petiole of the
myxoma (there could be remaining tissue).</p><p>The minimal access surgery has become widespread in the milieu of cardiac surgery in last
two decades. The minimally invasive video-assisted surgery for cardiac tumor resection is
also becoming an exciting technique; recently, more cases with cardiac myxoma have received
this novel procedure. Vistarini et al.<sup>[<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]</sup>
and Schroeyers et al.<sup>[<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]</sup> have reported
that minimally invasive video-assisted technique for myxoma resection is effective, safe,
and a valuable alternative approach to standard sternotomy, with similar satisfactory
outcomes. However, those reports have small case series and there are concerns in applying a
minimally invasive approach to myxoma resection, because it may increase manipulation of
tumor, thus raising the possibility of local and systemic embolization. Therefore, there is
a requirement for larger case series and experiments.</p><p>Nowadays, the surgical treatment of cardiac myxomas may be successfully performed with low
morbidity and mortality rates in many cardiac surgery centers. In several large case series,
the early mortality rates have been 1-5%<sup>[<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]</sup>. Our results were comparable with those
reported in the literature; the early mortality rate was 2% in our series. In fact, early
and late mortality could be related to the preoperative condition of the patients rather
than cardiac or extracardiac conditions as well as to the age of the patient at the time of
surgery.</p><p>Cardiac myxomas may recur postoperatively, but the mechanism of recurrent myxoma has not
been clearly understood yet. Recurrence may occur within a few months to several years after
the initial surgical excision and most recurrent myxomas are found during the first four
years<sup>[<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]</sup>. Atypical primary sites,
insufficiency excision, metastasis, multicentricity and familial inheritance are all risk
factors of the recurrent myxoma after surgery<sup>[<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]</sup>. In the largest series in the literature, the recurrence rates of 2-6%
have been reported<sup>[<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]</sup>. In our study, we observed no recurrence in the 39 patients
that completed the follow-up, with a mean follow-up time of 102 months. That is due to the
fact that no familial or multiple myxomas were present in our series. However, Pacini et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]</sup> reported a recurrence rate of
4.4% in 91 myxoma survivors and all of recurrent myxoma cases were sporadic. We would like
to emphasize that recurrence may be prevented with the appropriate surgical approach and
technique. To prevent recurrence, complete tumor excision, including at least 5 mm normal
area of clean tissue around it, is crucial. Hence, we recommend the opening of both atria
because it provides adequate visualization and access for surgical resection of left atrial
myxomas. Lastly, despite the very low incidence of recurrence, patients should be followed
to evaluate tumor recurrence through annual echocardiography.</p><p>There were some limitations due to the retrospective nature of this study, especially
considering the long-term follow-up. Over the years, advances in cardiac surgical techniques
and myocardial protection strategies have improved patient survival and reduced
postoperative morbidity. Echocardiographic techniques are also improved, providing highly
detailed and accurate information during those years and allowing cardiologist and cardiac
surgeons to better evaluate and follow up patients. Another limitation of this study was the
lack of a control group, which precluded comparison of surgical approaches, because the
number of patients was insufficient in the uniatrial approach group. Despite these
limitations, we believe this study provides an opinion about the importance of surgical
technique for preventing recurrence. Additionally, this study also provides insight into the
natural history of cardiac myxomas, showing good long-term outcomes after surgical
resection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Although cardiac myxomas are benign tumors, they should be treated surgically as soon as
possible after diagnosis because of embolic complications and obstructive signs. To prevent
recurrence, especially in cardiac myxomas which are located in the left atrium, preferred
biatrial approach is suggested for complete resection of the tumor and to avoid residual
tumor. Appropriate surgical technique gives nearly excellent results.</p><table-wrap id="t5" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="10%" span="1"/><col width="90%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors&#x02019; roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">AY</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Conception and study design; realization of operations and/or trials;

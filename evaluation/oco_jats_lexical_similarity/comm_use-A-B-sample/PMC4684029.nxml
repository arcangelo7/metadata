Combined with the low level of remuneration and poor monitoring of outcomes, the result appears to be that the DES has had little effect on clinical behaviour.<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> For example, among 75% of newly registered patients between 2007 and 2009 who had entries for alcohol consumption on a primary care database, only 9% were recorded as completing a validated screening questionnaire despite this financial incentive<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and NICE guidance to screen newly registered patients. Locally Enhanced Services can offer moderately increased financial incentives and this may explain some of the regional variation in screening that has been identified.<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><boxed-text position="float"><sec><title>How this fits in</title><p>Guidelines recommend intervening on both smoking and alcohol use opportunistically on a regular basis. In practice, analyses of GP recording databases indicate that a brief intervention on smoking is much more common than on alcohol. However, recent evidence suggests that the QOF incentives to promote intervention on smoking may have made the estimates for delivery based on recording databases somewhat unreliable. Therefore, this study used up-to-date and representative data from the perspective of patients to assess the prevalence of people who smoke or drink excessively, and who receive a brief intervention. This study confirmed that intervention on smoking appeared much more common than on alcohol: whereas approximately half of smokers in England visiting their GP in the previous year reported having received advice on smoking cessation, &#x0003c;10% of those who drink excessively reported having received advice on their alcohol consumption. In view of the substantial QOF incentives for the delivery of smoking brief interventions and the less substantial opt-in arrangements for alcohol brief interventions, this study adds to the evidence suggesting that more substantial incentives would be associated with greater delivery of a brief intervention.</p></sec></boxed-text><p>Thus, there appears to be a large difference based on primary care databases between the delivery of brief intervention for smoking and alcohol,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> which may relate to the substantial financial incentives for smoking brief intervention but less substantial opt-in arrangements for alcohol.<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> However, it is possible that figures derived from GP recording overestimate the delivery of smoking brief interventions because it is the recording rather than the &#x02018;doing&#x02019; that is incentivised. Prior to the introduction of QOF incentives, there was a good correspondence between the rate of recording of GP advice and the proportion of patients recalling advice in the national Primary Care Trust Patient Surveys; since their introduction in 2004, however, the rate of recording has exceeded that of patient recall.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The most recent estimate from the Primary Care Trust Patient Surveys is that 40% of smokers received cessation advice; however, this is of limited use as it represents a self-selected sample of patients who chose to return the survey. Estimates regarding the delivery of alcohol brief intervention are also likely to be inaccurate because they are often based on the rate at which GPs record screening, rather than conduct a brief intervention.</p><p>The aim of this study was to use up-to-date and representative data from the perspective of patients to assess the prevalence and characteristics of people who smoke or drink excessively, and who receive a brief intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>METHOD</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design</title><p>Data were collected using cross-sectional household surveys of representative samples of the population of adults in England, conducted monthly between March 2014 and November 2014.

The first stage is to split England into 171 356 areas (each comprising approximately 300 households), stratified according to a geodemographic analysis of the population. Areas are then randomly allocated to interviewers, who conduct interviews within that area until the quota based on the probability of being at home is fulfilled. The method is superior to conventional quota sampling &#x02014; where interviewers can select non-randomly from the whole population to meet quotas &#x02014; because the output areas are randomly allocated and the scope for bias is limited to the choice of properties to approach non-randomly within the small output areas.</p><p>A response rate cannot be calculated because there is no definite gross sample, with units fulfilling the criteria of the quota being interchangeable.

Data were weighted using the rim (marginal) weighting technique to match an English population profile on the dimensions of age, social grade, region, tenure, ethnicity, and working status within sex.

In the next step, the data were then readjusted by an algorithm that sought to match the sample to a second dimension, while minimising distortion; this continued until the final dimension had been matched. This process was iterated until there was a good fit across the dimensions (indicated by the sum of root mean square differences between the sample and the specification across the dimensions being &#x0003c;0.005 multiplied by the overall unweighted sample size).

Smokers receiving advice, compared with those who did not, were more likely to be older, female, have a disability, have made more quit attempts in the previous year, have greater nicotine dependence, but be less likely to have no post-16 qualifications. People drinking excessively and receiving advice had higher AUDIT scores and were more likely to be male than those who did not receive advice, but no other associations were clearly established.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The present findings are similar to estimates of delivery of brief interventions derived from primary care databases.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> A major strength of this study is that these figures are up to date and from the perspective of patients identified from a large representative sample of the English population. A consequent limitation is that the findings may be inaccurate because patients either forgot about receiving an intervention or misjudged the time period assessed. Although self-reported data are subject to such recall bias, there is evidence that financial incentives lead to improved recording &#x02014; rather than improved delivery &#x02014; of brief interventions, so it is important to use data from both GP records and patients when forming a judgement.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Another strength of the study arises because the delivery of alcohol brief interventions is often not recorded by clinicians, but generally indirectly estimated from the rate at which patients are screened for excessive alcohol consumption.<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Future research could compare estimates more directly by surveying a representative sample of the population, and seeking permission and details to allow the patient records of responders to be identified.</p><p>This study is also limited by assessing only the association between receipt of brief interventions and patient characteristics; the receipt of brief intervention is also likely related to GP characteristics and those of their surgeries.<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with existing literature</title><p>People with higher compared with lower AUDIT scores were more likely to recall a brief intervention than to not: the associated odds of recalling a brief intervention were 17% greater for every point increase above 8 on the AUDIT scale (OR 1.17). This finding is consistent with a previous analysis which indicated that GPs were more likely to identify dependent drinkers compared with those who were drinking at lower, but still harmful, levels.<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> GPs have also been found to identify an alcohol use disorder less often in younger people and dependence less often in females,<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> which is consistent with the associations between age, sex, and receipt of brief intervention in the study presented here.</p><p>The association for smokers with age, sex, previous quit attempts, and dependence reflects the profile of treatment-seeking smokers and is likely to be related to GPs focusing on smokers who express an interest in stopping.<xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> These findings suggest GPs are not yet following the latest national guidance from the National Centre for Smoking Cessation and Training (NCSCT) in England, which recommends that they go straight to the offer of support, rather than assess a patient&#x02019;s interest in quitting.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></p><p>The association with disability may reflect the greater incentives for brief intervention among smokers with chronic health conditions.<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Previous research has found that smokers from more disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds want and try to quit as much as other smokers but find it more difficult.<xref rid="b49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> This difficulty suggests the marginal benefit from brief intervention recommending support would be greater for this group. However, the current study suggests that smokers without post-16 qualifications are less likely to receive an intervention, which is concerning in terms of health inequalities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Implications for practice</title><p>The UK government&#x02019;s alcohol strategy was criticised by Alcohol Health Alliance UK for its failure to implement a QOF indicator for screening and brief intervention for excessive alcohol consumption.<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> In view of the substantial QOF incentives for the delivery of smoking brief interventions and the less substantial opt-in arrangements for alcohol brief interventions, this study adds to the evidence suggesting that more substantial incentives are likely to be associated with greater delivery of brief intervention.<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p><p>There are other reasons why the delivery of smoking and alcohol brief interventions may differ; for example, excessive alcohol consumption takes longer to establish than smoking because it requires screening, motivation to change is weaker among those who drink excessively than among smokers in England,<xref rid="b50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="b51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> and drinking advice may be less straightforward because reduction is often the goal rather than abstinence. However, the magnitude of the difference suggests that a number of factors could be important and scope remains for enhanced financial incentives to have a significant impact.</p><p>The focus of this article is alcohol and tobacco control in England. Although it is true that the effectiveness of any policy will always depend on a variety of local, cultural, and contextual factors,<xref rid="b52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> studying what happens in England with contrasting financial incentives for the delivery of smoking and alcohol brief interventions could provide an indirect indication as to what is achievable in other countries.</p><p>There is wide debate about what constitutes an effective alcohol brief intervention.<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> An enhanced incentive scheme for alcohol brief intervention in England &#x02014; such as a QOF indicator for unselected screening and brief intervention delivery &#x02014; may maximise effectiveness and cost-effectiveness by being structured to encourage brief screening followed by simple feedback and written information.<xref rid="b53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> The simple behaviour change technique of self-monitoring has been shown to be effective for reducing alcohol consumption and would be a relatively easy technique for GPs to use with their patients.<xref rid="b56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> Including this would meet the recent recommendation of the House of Lords Science and Technology Select Committee to include more explicit advice in guidance on how behaviour change techniques can be applied to reducing excessive alcohol consumption.<xref rid="b57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></p><p>Any improvement to incentive schemes would likely be synergistically enhanced by the simultaneous provision of additional training on how to deliver brief interventions.<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> NICE guidelines recommend that all health and social care professionals should, as a minimum, be able to deliver a very brief intervention.<xref rid="b58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> The NCSCT offers an online brief advice module, which increases the frequency and quality of smoking brief interventions,<xref rid="b59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> while training on the formulation of specific action plans increases the rate of asking about smoking;<xref rid="b60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> future research could assess whether such advice modules and action plans have a similar effect on alcohol brief intervention.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We gratefully acknowledge the funding listed above.

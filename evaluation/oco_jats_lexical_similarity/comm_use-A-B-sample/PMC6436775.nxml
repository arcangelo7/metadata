effusion (PE) treatments by a survey conducted at the Department of
Cardiovascular Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Atat&#x000fc;rk University.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In order to get comparable results, the patients with PE were divided into
three groups - group A, 480 patients who underwent subxiphoid

underwent echocardiography (ECHO)-guided percutaneous catheter drainage.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the three groups of patients, the most important symptom and physical sign
were dyspnea and tachycardia, respectively. The most common causes of PE
were uremic pericarditis in patients who underwent tube pericardiostomy,
postoperative PE in patients who underwent CT-guided percutaneous catheter
drainage, and cancer-related PE in patients who underwent ECHO-guided
percutaneous catheter drainage. In all the patients, relief of symptoms was
achieved after surgical intervention. There was no treatment-related
mortality in any group of patients. In patients with tuberculous
pericarditis, the rates of recurrent PE and/or constrictive pericarditis

pericardium leaves. In routine echocardiography (ECHO) controls, this condition
occurs in one of every ten patients<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The normally existing 15-50 ml of pericardial liquid in humans let the heart work in
a frictionless environment. Phospholipids are present in this liquid. The contents
of electrolyte and plasma are nearly the same, and the protein content is 1/3 of the
plasma. The occurrence of symptoms depends on the amount of liquid, the time of
collection, and the physical properties of the pericardium<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>ECHO is the most valuable diagnostic tool for assessing PE. By using M-mode ECHO,
even a small amount of liquid can be detected. The sizes of the effusion are
classified considering the anterior and posterior regions of diastolic echo-free
space, being lightweight (&#x0003c;10 mm), medium (10-20), and large (&#x0003e; 20
mm)<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. When there is 300
ml of effusion, the separation can be seen both in front and rear regions. In
advanced degree of effusion, the image of a pendulum heart is available<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. Tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can also be
used for the detection of PE, and it has been reported that computerized tomography
(CT) can be used as a guiding method in treatment of patients with PE<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>, especially in cases of
postoperative PE. High frequency of localized effusion in postoperative cases makes
CT guiding more valuable.</p><p>The clinical significance of any PE depends on the presence of an underlying disease
and hemodynamic disturbances, determined by the intrapericardial pressure increase.
Unless there is evidence of cardiac tamponade and there is no need for
pericardiocentesis in small amounts of fluid<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>, the underlying cause, if diagnosed (<italic>e.g</italic>.,
hypothyroidism), should be treated, instead of making the pericardiocentesis. In
special conditions, like suspicion of tuberculosis, pericardial biopsy may be
required. In this case, subxiphoid pericardiostomy makes it possible, in addition to
provide symptomatic relief.</p><p>The optimal treatment is controversial. In the absence of an actual tamponade or a
high-risk effusion, management should be individualized. In the present study, it
was aimed to retrospectively evaluate the results of three drainage techniques:
subxiphoid tube pericardiostomy, CT-guided drainage, and ECHO-guided drainage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>Totally, 553 patients were divided into three groups: in the group A, 480 patients
underwent subxiphoid pericardiostomy due to PE; in group B, 28 patients underwent
CT-guided percutaneous catheter drainage; and in group C, 45 patients underwent
ECHO-guided percutaneous catheter drainage. These procedures occurred between 1996
and 2010. Patient's data were obtained from the patients' files. Before 2000, PE, if
needed, were treated by subxiphoid drainage. After 2000, in patients with
postoperative localized PE, especially in the lateral surface of the right ventricle
and posterior surface of the left ventricle, CT-guided drainage has been performed.
In patients with general effusion, causing at least 10 mm separation at the right
ventricular anterior surface, the ECHO-guided drainage is being preferred.</p><p>ECHO was used to determine both the diagnosis and the severity of effusion. While
assessing the severity, if the distance between the left ventricular posterior wall
and the pericardium during diastole is below 10 mm, it is accepted and classified as
mild PE; between 10 mm and 20 mm, it is classified as moderate PE; and over 20 mm,
as severe PE<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Cardiac tamponade
was defined by clinical evaluation and ECHO of the patient. Tachycardia, although it
is not a lung problem, causes dyspnea and tachypnea and increased the central venous
pressure (CVP). In case of presence of classic symptoms, such as hypotension and
pulsus paradoxus tamponade, patients were classified as tamponade (<xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="t1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Symptoms of patients with pericardial effusion.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="all"><colgroup span="1"><col width="25%" span="1"/><col width="25%" span="1"/><col width="25%" span="1"/><col width="25%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Symptoms</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group A (n=480)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group B (n=28)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group C (n=45)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Dyspnea</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">372 (77.5%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22 (78.5%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">36 (80%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Chest pain</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">218 (45.4%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13 (46.4%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">27 (60%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Tachycardia</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">248 (51.6%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17 (60.7%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">29 (64.4)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Edema</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">152 (31.6%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11 (39.2%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21 (46.6%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fever</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">123 (25.6%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 (28.5%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11 (24.4%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Orthopnoea</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">102 (21.2%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9 (32.1%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14 (31.1%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Abdominal respiration</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">77 (16%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (14.2%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 (17.7%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Syncope</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17 (3.5%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (3.5%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (6.6%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cough</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">116 (24.1%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11 (39.2%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19 (42.2%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Jugular venous distension</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">228 (47.5%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13 (46.4%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22 (48.8%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hypotension</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">48 (10%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (10.7%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 (22.2%)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec><title>Subxiphoid Tube Pericardiostomy</title><p>The subxiphoid tube pericardiostomy was applied under general anesthesia (n = 30,
6.25%) or local anesthesia supported by sedation (n = 450, 93.75%). General
anesthesia was preferred mostly on kids and induction was done with 1,5 mg/kg of
ketamine. Also, 0.1 mg/kg of vecuronium neuromuscular block was used and
anesthesia was maintained by 60% of nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), 40% of
oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), and 0.5-1% of isoflurane.</p><p>As there is a hypotension risk in patients who underwent general anesthesia, they
were covered and marked with paint before induction. In local anesthesia, 2%
lidocaine was injected subcutaneously. Sedation was achieved by the injection of
1 mg/kg of ketamine or 1-2cc of intravenous (IV) midazolam. About 5-6 cm of
incision was made from the epigastrium to the xiphoid. After the subcutaneous
skin incision, 2% lidocaine was injected into the rectus muscle and the xiphoid
again. By cutting the linea alba and the xiphoid and dissecting the subxiphoid
tissues, the pericardium anterior face was reached. Then, some amount of liquid
was aspirated by the injector; in order to determine whether the hemorrhagic
liquid was defibrinated or not, its coagulation was observed. By holding and
pulling the pericardium, 3-5 cm&#x000b2; of it was excised for pathological examination.
Pericardial fluid samples were collected for cytological, biochemical, and
microbiological analyses, then the liquid was poured in a controlled manner;
meanwhile, IV digoxin was injected to prevent sudden cardiac dilatation.</p><p>Pericardial cavity was visually and manually checked, adhesions and mass lesions
were investigated. Adhesions were removed carefully with the help of fingers.
With a different incision, 2-4 cm under the former incision, the drainage tube
was placed in the pericardial cavity in order to provide postoperative drainage.
Making a separate incision from the drainage tube was preferred to prevent the
development of postoperative wound infection and incisional hernia. The drainage
tube was connected to a closed underwater drainage system, and the subxiphoid
incision was closed according to the procedure.</p></sec><sec><title>CT-guided Catheter Drainage Method</title><p>The feasibility of performing CT-guided catheter drainage on 28 patients was
determined by clinical, echocardiographic, and tomographic assessments.</p><p>All patients were assessed by helical CT. In order to determine the entry point
of PE drainage, 10 mm range images were taken from the heart apex to the arcus
aorta. After the assessment, the skin was marked on the determined entry point
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). To ensure that the metallic
needle was in the right place, CT was performed. And to prevent complications
that could occur during electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, an intravenous
saline with IV opening was inserted, and blood pressure was monitored at
frequent intervals.</p><p>

</p><p>Having been colored and disinfected, the marked area was covered with sterile
drapes. As a local anesthetic agent, 2% lidocaine was used. Then, an 18 G needle
with negative puncture was entered to the pericardial cavity, the needle was
fixed at the level of liquid aspiration, and the CT was taken again to reaffirm
the needle's position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). After
confirming that it was in the intrapericardial space, the liquid was aspirated
and evaluated. If hemorrhagic characteristics were thought to be possible after
confirming that the blood defibrinated, a 0.035" guidewire was sent to the
pericardial cavity through the needle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure
3</xref>). The needle was removed and the CT was taken; after confirming
that the guidewire was in the intrapericardial cavity, an 8 or 10 F nephrostomy
catheter was advanced into the pericardial cavity through a catheter guide. A
three-way tap was installed in the tip of the catheter and the liquid was poured
into a 50 ml syringe. The catheter was identified and it was connected to the
closed underwater drainage system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure
4</xref>).</p><p>

</p></sec><sec><title>ECHO-guided Pericardiocentesis/Catheter Drainage Method</title><p>Having been assessed by ECHO and under intensive care conditions, blood pressure
and ECG monitoring were completed, and the patients were operated at the bedside
after taking all precautions. After dyeing and disinfecting the subxiphoid area,
the patients were put into a 45&#x000b0; tilt position, and they were covered by sterile
sheets. After local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine, a small incision was made by
an 11" knife. Under the xiphoid, using ECHO as a guide, an 18G needle was
lifted, with a slope of 15-20&#x000b0; and negative pressure, aiming at the left
shoulder. When the aspiration fluid came, the location of the needle tip was
confirmed by ECHO, and an 0038" guidewire was sent to the pericardial space
through the needle. After seeing the guidewire in the pericardia via ECHO, a 6F
pigtail was sent through guidewire. During this process, the patients' heart
rate and blood pressure were frequently measured. The three-way tap was
installed at the catheter and fluid was aspirated into a 50 ml syringe.
Pericardial liquid was aspirated slowly and intermittently in order to prevent
cardiac decompression. Aspiration was done every 6 hours and the amount of
liquid was checked by daily ECHO.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses of the results were done using the Statistical Packet for
Social Science (SPSS) 11.0 software and x&#x000b2; and post-hoc tests were applied to
the data. In this study, recurrent effusion ratios obtained from the groups, the
number of cases developing constriction, complication rates, and 1-month
mortality were determined by x&#x000b2; tests, 3x2 contingency table, or 2x2 Fisher's
exact test. For the length of in-hospital stay and duration of the catheter or
drainage tube stay, a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used. In
bilateral comparisons, <italic>P</italic>-values were obtained by applying the
least square difference (LSD) method and interpreted; <italic>P</italic> values
&#x0003c; 0.05 were considered significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 553 patients were included in the study. The mean age was 6 &#x000b1; 79

ages ranging from 6 months to 84 years (mean 35.7 years), 261 of whom being men
(55%) and 219 being women (45%) - were examined. ECHO detected mild PE in 16
patients (3%), medium PE in 193 patients (40%), and severe PE in 271 patients
(57%). All of the patients with traumatic PE had tamponade symptoms (n = 25).
Some patients also underwent invasive procedures like blunt thoracic trauma,
coronary angioplasty, stent implantation, and temporary endocardial pacemaker

pericardiostomy. Intraoperative myocardial injury (MI) occurred in five patients
(1%). In these cases, upon failing to control bleeding with subxiphoid approach,
urgent median sternotomy was done. In two patients, bleeding occurred during the
removal of adhesions connected to the tuberculous pericarditis; in other three
cases, bleeding occurred during the placement of the tube connected to the
traumatic rupture of the right atrium. None of the patients were lost.</p><p>The reasons for the subxiphoid tube pericardiostomy in the patients were: uremic

method, 15 were female (53.5%) and 13 were male (46.5%). Their ages varied
between 1 and 80 years (mean 41.3 years). The most important symptom in these
patients was dyspnea. Relief was observed in the symptoms of 25 patients who
were successfully operated. ECHO detected moderate effusion in ten of these
patients (35.7%) and severe effusion in 18 (64.3%). Thirteen of these patients
(46.4%) had previously undergone open-heart surgery. These patients had
effusions, two of them due to malignancy, one due to bacterial infection, and
two due to uremia. Other ten patients (35.7%) had idiopathic PE (<xref rid="t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>The effusion localization was in the left ventricular lateral in 14 patients,
left ventricular posterior in eight patients, right atrium posterolateral in
five patients, and right ventricular posterior in one patient. In the patients
whose daily amount of drainage were followed, it was applied three-way tap for
the aspiration of liquid when necessary. When the daily amount of drainage was
&#x0003c; 50 ml, catheters were taken guided by ECHO on the lack of intrapericardial
liquid.</p><p>As for complications, upon development of hemopericardium, depending on the
pericardial laceration, subxiphoid tube pericardiostomy was performed under
local anesthesia in one patient. Although the needle entered the
intrapericardial space in one patient, the liquid was not aspirated. So,
considering that there could be organized hematoma under general anesthesia, the
hematoma was evacuated by opening a pericardial window through anterior
mini-thoracotomy.</p><p>In one case in which was applied CT-guided catheter drainage method due to uremic
PE, ECHO and CT detected the existence of fluid and the presence of catheter in
the thorax; because it was a right pleural effusion in severe level,
pericardiopleural window was opened with right mini-thoracotomy.</p><p>About 1000 ml of liquid was evacuated from thorax and 1000 ml was from the
pericardial cavity. In the remaining 25 patients (93%), the desired results were
obtained from the operations performed.</p><p>In 11 patients (39%), it was aspirated serous fluid; in 10 patients (38%),
hemorrhagic fluid; in seven patients (25%), transudate fluid; and in one
patient, purulent fluid. The amount of aspirated fluid was 50-1500 ml (mean 920
&#x000b1; 225). The minimum drainage was from chronic renal failure (CRF)
patients; the maximum drainage was from an idiopathic pericarditis patient.</p><p>In two (7.1%) of the patients who underwent CT-guided catheter drainage, there
was recurrence; again, the catheter drainage was applied with the same method
and no recurrence was observed. There were no mortalities due to the process.
One patient died three days after the surgery because of fulminant hepatitis.

the pericardium can cause PE. In this study, in which the causes of PE were
presented, those were often associated with underlying causes, as uremia, malignancy
(lung, breast, ovarian carcinoma, and lymphoma), many bacterial infections, few
viral infections, myocardial infarction, and autoimmune diseases. In most studies,
uremic pericarditis is a rare cause of PE, however, in ours, it emerged as the most
common cause<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. Since our hospital
is the dialysis center of the region, the incidence of uremic PE is high.</p><p>The most important step in management of PE is to determine if tamponade is present
or if there are any features suggesting a high chance of developing tamponade in the
near time. While the tamponade rate was 44% in previous studies, 27% of the patients
had clinical tamponade in our study<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Symptomatic PE can be treated by various procedures. Pericardiocentesis with CT- or
ECHO-guided catheter drainage, subxiphoid tube pericardiostomy, and subxiphoid or
anterior thoracotomy with pericardiopleural window opening can be used in the
treatment of PE. Among these methods, the most effective one must be chosen
according to the patient's clinic and history. Therefore, the optimal treatment
modality is controversial<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>. In the absence of an actual
tamponade or a high-risk effusion, management should be individualized.</p><p>Cardiac pericardiocentesis in tamponade patients is a life-saving method. However,
more can be done safely in 10 mm and over effusions during diastole. The most common
and serious complication of pericardiocentesis is the laceration and perforation of
myocardium. ECHO- or scope-guided methods will reduce the risk<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. There were not such
complications in our studies. During pericardiocentesis, serious arrhythmias,
vascular hemorrhages, pneumothorax, infections, and major vagal reactions have also
been reported<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. As Park et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> have noted in the summary, they have shown that
PE can be monitored by videothoracoscopy under local anesthesia. In a study by Palma
et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>, videothoracoscopy has
shown excellent mediastinal and chest inspection ability, and it may be performed on
a safe and fast manner, besides providing elements that could change the diagnosis
and, consequently, the specific treatment of some patients.</p><p>In traumatic pericarditis and especially in purulent pericarditis, surgical drainage
is more preferred<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>. In our study, in the patients
who underwent subxiphoid tube pericardiostomy, the complication rate with CT and
ECHO guidance was lower than in patients who underwent catheter drainage (1%).</p><p>The ideal procedure should be easily implemented, should result in minimal morbidity
and mortality, should provide full and permanent drainage, should not be recurrent,
and should provide material for adequate histological, cytological, and
microbiological analyses to identify the cause of the effusion<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>. All the treatments were successful and have been
sufficient to ensure drainage of symptomatic effusion. CT- or ECHO-guided catheter
drainage, subxiphoid tube pericardiostomy, and anterior mini-thoracotomy with
pericardiopleural window opening were the drainage methods in our clinic. The
advantages of catheter drainage with CT or transthoracic ECHO guidance were no need
for incision and general anesthesia, and it was less painful. These methods are less
successful, and the risk of complications is high in minimal effusion and
posteriorly located effusions. Pericardial biopsy samples cannot be taken with
catheter methods. The advantages of subxiphoid tube pericardiostomy are that it
allows the visualization of the pericarditis and pericardial cavity of the pole and
that it makes possible a complete drainage and to get pericardial tissue for
pathological examination. In our studies, from the 480 PE patients who underwent
subxiphoid tube pericardiostomy, 462 (96.2 %) were subjected to local anesthesia
with sedation and 28 (5.8%) to general anesthesia. General anesthesia is usually
preferred in children. Local anesthesia was applied to patients in whom we performed
catheter drainage with transthoracic ECHO and CT guidance.</p><p>Although pericardiocentesis is life-saving in instable patients, pericardial biopsy
samples cannot be extracted; also, pericardiocentesis is inadequate to diagnose
tuberculosis in purulent pericarditis and invasive malignant cases<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>. Although this method ensures some relief in patients with
symptoms of tamponade, it is not suitable for definitive therapy<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>. Even in the presence of active tuberculous pericarditis,
culture taken from pericardial liquid may be negative. Therefore, in addition to the
pericardial fluid drainage, it is recommended to make a pericardial
biopsy<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. Since the
tuberculous pericarditis' treatment is long and difficult, the risk of recurrence
and constriction of this disease is higher than of other diseases<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>-<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>. In our study, patients with tuberculosis pericarditis
were the most prone to develop constrictive pericarditis. The low sociocultural
level of the patients and their non-adherence to treatment have led to the
development of recurrent effusions and constriction<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Malignancy is another condition leading to cardiac tamponade. In centers where there
are many oncology patients, most of those have malignancies; in other centers,
benign pathologies may occur more frequently<sup>[<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>. In the acutely symptomatic patient, pericardiocentesis
provides immediate relief of symptoms but it is associated with high recurrence
rates. Patients with a limited expected lifespan can be managed with repeated
pericardiocentesis or extended pericardial catheter drainage. For patients with a
long life expectancy, surgical drainage provides the highest freedom from
recurrence<sup>[<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>. In a
multicenter study by Moores et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> with 155 patients, the rate of tamponade due to malignancy was
53% and the rate of tamponade due to tuberculosis was 2%. In our study, the rate of
tamponade due to tuberculosis was 13.5% in group A patients, 7.1% in group B
patients, and 28.8% in group C patients. In PE due to malignancy, the treatment
method should be selected by examining the patient's condition. Although there are
intrapericardial treatment methods, there are no randomized studies providing their
reliability. Recurrence was observed in approximately 50-70% of the malignant PE
patients<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>. For these
reasons, subxiphoid pericardiostomy, a very small portion using pericardiopleural
window, was often performed in our patients. Allen et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> performed subxiphoid tube pericardiostomy in 94
of the 117 patients with cardiac tamponade; 23 hemodynamically stable patients
underwent percutaneous catheter drainage. 0% of mortality and one complication
(1.1%) were observed in patients with subxiphoid tubes pericardiostomy. While 17% of
complications were reported in patients who underwent percutaneous drainage, only 4%
them showed mortality. Recurrence was reported as 1.1% in patients who underwent
subxiphoid tube pericardiostomy and as 30% in those who underwent percutaneous
drainage. In cases of tamponade with PE, percutaneous drainage was reported in those
who didn't have hemodynamic stability. It was ensured that subxiphoid tube
pericardiostomy was more effective and trustworthy in those who had hemodynamic
stability.</p><p>In our study, as there was apparent tamponade in 10 (22.2%) cases, we've performed
catheter drainage with echocardiographic pericardiocentesis at bedside and the
relief of symptoms was observed. In addition, in 15 of the patients who underwent
ECHO-guided catheter drainage because of the recurrence of PE, a subxiphoid tube
pericardiostomy was performed and no recurrence was observed later. None of these
patients developed major complications, except one patient who developed hematoma
because of subcutaneous arterial puncture; the hematoma went down with the
application of cold. No fall was observed in the patients' hematocrit levels.
Mortality was 0% in patients who underwent subxiphoid tube drainage. While no
mortality was seen due to operations, patients died from primary diseases.
Recurrence in these patients was 9.4%, and most of them were tuberculous
pericarditis patients.</p><p>Cegielski et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> identified PCR
positive in 14 of the 20 tuberculous pericarditis patients. In this study, 42 of the
50 patients who underwent subxiphoid tube pericardiostomy were reported as PCR
positive. In our studies, we concluded that subxiphoid tube pericardiostomy is more
valuable as it allows biopsy for diagnosis and treatment.</p><p>Palatianos et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> reported that
microorganisms developed in seven of the eight exudative PE patients. In our study,
there was a breeding in the pericardial fluid samples that were extracted from the
65 patients who underwent subxiphoid tube pericardiostomy and in four patients who
underwent ECHO-guided catheter drainage.</p><p>Data obtained from our patients showed the development of recurrent effusion
(<italic>P</italic>=0.365), constriction rate (<italic>P</italic>=0.638),
complication rate (<italic>P</italic>=0.425), and mortality rate in the first
follow-up month (<italic>P</italic>=0.655). There was no significant difference
between the three groups (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) (<xref rid="t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>There are several notable limitations in this study. This is a retrospective study
that is subject to be studied in detail and subject to selection bias; nevertheless,
propensity matching was utilized to partially account for these biases. Other
reasons for limitations are that this study was performed at a single center, that
may not reflect the patients' characteristics and etiologies seen at other
institutions, and that long-term follow-up was not possible in many of our patients,
limiting our analysis to short-term outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>As a conclusion, pericardiocentesis can be always necessary for diagnosis of the
cause of PE. Although there are many methods of treatment of PE, which method should
be used in which patient must be selected by careful examination, the patient's
clinic results, and the treatment effectiveness. Although 2-D ECHO is the diagnostic
imaging modality of choice for the initial evaluation of PE, CT can be important
when more precise localization and quantification of pericardial fluid are
necessary, when an effusion is complex or loculated, or when a clot is present. We
believe that CT-guided catheter drainage method should be preferred when the
patient's comfort is at the forefront, when there is no need to take the diagnostic
tissue sample, and in postoperative PE cases. To overcome the intrinsic limitation
of the pericardiocentesis technique, it is recommended to perform the procedure with
image guidance whenever it is possible. Especially in patients with tamponade,
ECHO-guided catheter drainage is an outstanding treatment method that can be done
bedside to provide emergency relief. However, as there is no possibility of biopsy,
we believe that it can be inadequate in terms of diagnostic value because it allows
only the examination of the liquid. Subxiphoid tube pericardiostomy is a more
effective and trustworthy method; it is thought that this method is more effective
in diagnosis and treatment as it allows biopsy, examination of the pericardial
space, and removal of the adhesions. Further studies should be carried out at
multi-centered conditions to verify the results.</p><table-wrap id="t6" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="10%" span="1"/><col width="90%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">AC</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Conception and design of the work;

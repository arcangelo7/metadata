Collagen type II (COL2A1) was previously considered to be only a structural component of the cartilage matrix, but recently, it has been revealed to be an extracellular signaling molecule that can significantly suppress chondrocyte hypertrophy. However, the mechanisms by which COL2A1 regulates hypertrophic differentiation remain unclear. In our study, a <italic>Col2a1</italic> p.Gly1170Ser mutant mouse model was constructed, and Col2a1 loss was demonstrated in homozygotes. Loss of Col2a1 was found to accelerate chondrocyte hypertrophy through the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-SMAD1 pathway. Upon interacting with COL2A1, integrin &#x003b2;1 (ITGB1),&#x000a0;the major receptor for COL2A1, competed with BMP receptors for binding to SMAD1 and then inhibited SMAD1 activation and nuclear import. COL2A1 could also activate ITGB1-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and, through ERK1/2-SMAD1 interaction, it further repressed SMAD1 activation, thus inhibiting BMP-SMAD1-mediated chondrocyte hypertrophy. Moreover, COL2A1 expression was downregulated, while chondrocyte hypertrophic markers and BMP-SMAD1 signaling activity were upregulated in degenerative human articular cartilage. Our study reveals novel mechanisms for the inhibition of chondrocyte hypertrophy by COL2A1 and suggests that the degradation and decrease in COL2A1 might initiate and promote osteoarthritis progression.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><title>Breaking a destructive cycle</title><p id="Par2">A signaling feedback loop that contributes to cartilage degeneration may offer a fruitful target for the treatment of osteoarthritis. During the early stages of this disorder, cartilage-forming chondrocytes undergo a process of expansion known as hypertrophy, after which they die and are replaced by calcium. Researchers led by Peiqiang Su and Dongsheng Huang of Sun Yat-sen University have demonstrated that COL2A1, an important structural protein, represents an important safeguard against hypertrophy. COL2A1 helps maintain chondrocytes in their normal, healthy state, but Su and Huang showed that signaling factors produced during cartilage repair can reduce COL2A1 levels. This in turn accelerates hypertrophy, promoting further depletion of COL2A1 and ultimately leading to full-blown osteoarthritis. Drugs that break this cycle and preserve COL2A1 could thus help protect endangered joints before the damage becomes severe.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Pathogenesis</kwd><kwd>Bone</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100002858</institution-id><institution>China Postdoctoral Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017M622873</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lian</surname><given-names>Chengjie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100003453</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (Guangdong Natural Science Foundation)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018A0303130260</award-id><award-id>2016A030313284</award-id><award-id>2017A030311008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name><name><surname>Peng</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Dongsheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Guangzhou Science and Technology Plan(No.201804010057); The Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 17ykpy06).</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science Foundation of China)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81802217</award-id><award-id>81371907</award-id><award-id>81572134</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lian</surname><given-names>Chengjie</given-names></name><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Dongsheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes is the terminal stage of endochondral ossification in the growth plate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> Hypertrophic differentiated chondrocytes are characterized by an enlarged size, high expression of collagen type X (COL10A1), runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), and low expression of cartilaginous specific markers, such as collagen type II (COL2A1) and SRY-box 9 (SOX9).

In healthy articular cartilage, chondrocytes remain in a postmitotic quiescent state, while in OA cartilage, some chondrocytes around OA cartilage lesions can be activated and undergo hypertrophy during the whole disease process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> In the current study, we demonstrate that COL2A1 acts as an extracellular signaling molecule to inhibit chondrocyte hypertrophy. Upon interaction with COL2A1, ITGB1 receptors compete with BMP receptors to bind with SMAD1 and then inhibit SMAD1 activation and nuclear import. COL2A1 also activated ITGB1-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and through ERK1/2&#x02212;SMAD1 interaction, it further repressed SMAD1 activation, thus inhibiting BMP-SMAD1-mediated hypertrophic differentiation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). COL2A1 loss led to the release of BMP-SMAD1 signaling suppression, resulting in chondrocyte hypertrophy and the promotion of OA progression, while supplementation with COL2A1 reversed chondrocyte hypertrophy. COL2A1 is suggested to be crucial in the chondrocyte quiescent state-hypertrophic differentiation-transition: COL2A1 maintains the chondrocyte quiescent state, while loss of COL2A1 leads to hypertrophic differentiation. We revealed the detailed mechanisms underlying COL2A1&#x02019;s regulation of the cartilaginous phenotype, in which ITGB1 and BMP-SMAD1 are the critical downstream effectors. Thus, our findings provide new insight into the regulation of cartilaginous phenotype and OA progression.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p>Functional mechanisms of COL2A1 on the BMP-SMAD1 pathway. The canonical BMP-SMAD1 pathway is initiated with the oligomerization of BMPR1 and BMPR2 induced by BMPs. BMPR2 phosphorylates BMPR1, and BMPR1, in turn, phosphorylates the C-terminus of SMAD1 (Ser463/465). C-terminal phosphorylated SMAD1 proteins partner with SMAD4 and translocate into the nucleus to initiate target gene transcription. ITGB1 is the major receptor for COL2A1, and upon its interaction with COL2A1, ITGB1 competes with BMPR1 for binding to SMAD1, thus inhibiting SMAD1<sup>S463/465</sup> phosphorylation and nuclear import. COL2A1 can also regulate SMAD1 activity via ITGB1-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Activated ERK1/2 phosphorylates the linker region (Ser206) of both unphosphorylated and C-terminal phosphorylated SMAD1. The linker region-phosphorylated SMAD1 is resistant to phosphorylation by BMPR1 at the C-terminal, while the interaction between the C-terminal-phosphorylated SMAD1 and SMAD4 can also be interrupted by a second phosphorylation of the linker region of SMAD1. As a result, SMAD1 activation can be repressed via various signaling pathways specifically in response to COL2A1.

We now introduce a disease-amplifying loop model to explain the effect of decreased COL2A1 on OA development. During the early stage of OA, once focal cartilage lesions develop, the proliferation and anabolism of surrounding chondrocytes are activated to repair the damage, during which BMP-SMAD1 is simultaneously activated and plays a critical role. However, the continuous activation of BMP-SMAD1 signaling also induces a portion of the surrounding chondrocytes to undergo hypertrophic differentiation, downregulating COL2A1 expression and upregulating MMPs that can break down the existing COL2A1. COL2A1 reduction prevents its suppression of the BMP-SMAD1 pathway and further accelerates chondrocyte hypertrophy, leading to the formation of the self-perpetuating disease-amplifying loop. Through this self-enhancing loop, chondrocyte hypertrophy and cartilage matrix destruction could propagate from focal damage to neighboring cartilage. In light of this disease model, we propose that the COL2A1 decrease plays a central role in OA development by acting as a main factor driving the aforementioned disease-amplifying loop. Targeting the key factors in this disease-amplifying loop may be a promising alternative OA therapy, considering that supplementation with functional COL2A1 directly into an OA joint remains difficult.

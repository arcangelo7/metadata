In comparison, there were 23 cases among those who did not receive the vaccine during the same time period.</p><p>The trial was led by WHO, together with Guinea&#x02019;s Ministry of Health, MSF and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, in collaboration with other international partners.</p><p>&#x0201c;While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa's Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenceless,&#x0201d; said Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO Assistant Director-General for Health Systems and Innovation, and the lead author of the study.</p><p>The manufacturer, Merck, Sharpe &#x00026; Dohme, has received special designations from the United States Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency allowing for faster-than-usual regulatory review of the vaccine, once it is submitted, so that it can be licensed as soon as possible.</p><p>Since Ebola virus was first identified in 1976, relatively small outbreaks have been reported in Africa. But the 2013&#x02013;2016 West African Ebola outbreak resulting in more than 11 300 deaths, has highlighted the need for a vaccine.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2016/ebola-vaccine-results">http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2016/ebola-vaccine-results</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>NCDs in the African Region</title><p>Most adults in WHO&#x02019;s African region have at least one risk factor for developing a noncommunicable disease (NCD), including heart disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, according to the <italic>Report on the status of major health risk factors for noncommunicable disease</italic>.</p><p>&#x0201c;These are diseases that can be life-threatening as well as debilitating, and they place a significant hardship on the region, robbing people and families of those who otherwise should be enjoying their most productive years,&#x0201d; wrote Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO&#x02019;s Regional Director for Africa in the foreword of the report released in December.</p><p>&#x0201c;We must do everything we can to reverse these disturbing trends.&#x0201d;</p><p>The report is based on data from WHO STEPwise surveys in 33 countries and on global school-based student health surveys in 19 countries in the Region.</p><p>It found that the prevalence of hypertension, or high blood pressure, in the African Region is the highest worldwide, affecting an estimated 46% of adults. In half of the countries in the African Region, at least one in three adults was found to be hypertensive.</p><p>The estimated prevalence of people who are overweight ranged from 12% in Madagascar to 60% in the Seychelles, with a median level of 35%, the report showed.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.afro.who.int/en/noncommunicable-diseases/npc-publications.html">http://www.afro.who.int/en/noncommunicable-diseases/npc-publications.html</ext-link></p><boxed-text id="Bb" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Cover photo</title></caption><p>This month&#x02019;s cover photo shows migrant workers in India returning home to Nepal to celebrate the festival of Vivah Panchami. </p><p><italic>The</italic>

This led to WHO and the United States CDC formulating the strategy and guidelines for an eradication campaign. The Carter Center joined the campaign five years later.</p><p>To date, WHO has certified 198 countries, territories and areas as dracunculiasis free.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/dracunculiasis">http://www.who.int/dracunculiasis</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>The SDGs: more ways to improve health</title><p>The 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) have widened the scope of health on the development agenda, going beyond the millennium development goals by recognizing, in addition, the burden of noncommunicable diseases, mental illness and injuries, and the risks to health during epidemics and humanitarian emergencies.</p><p>WHO Director-General Dr Margaret Chan has assembled a new team that will coordinate work across the Organization, aligning technical programmes with regional offices to drive action towards achieving the goals in countries.</p><p>Making progress towards these goals requires work across many sectors.</p><p>&#x0201c;Less than 4% of the US$ 7 trillion spent on health each year is devoted to the prevention of illness,&#x0201d; said Dr Chris Dye, Director of Strategy, Policy and Information at WHO Headquarters, who will be leading the new team.</p><p>&#x0201c;By acting on a wide range of social, economic and environmental determinants of health, in addition to providing better health services, we could avert 40% of premature deaths by 2030, giving extra years of healthy life to people around the world,&#x0201d; he said.</p><p>The team will be supported by Dr Shambhu Acharya, Director, Country Cooperation, and by Dr Nata Menabde, Executive Director at the WHO Office at the United Nations, and their teams.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/topics/sustainable-development-goals">http://www.who.int/topics/sustainable-development-goals</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>Report on health, law and rights</title><p>Public health laws can play an important role in advancing the right to health and in creating the conditions for people to live healthy lives, according to a new report produced by WHO and its partners.</p><p>The report, entitled <italic>Advancing the right to health: the vital role of law</italic> was released last month and provides guidance on the issues that need to be addressed when developing or amending national public health laws.

Rather than dissect the cadaver, Braune used a still unconventional method. He froze the woman&#x02019;s corpse solid then sliced it vertically in half to produce the first &#x0201c;frozen sections&#x0201d; of a pregnant body<xref ref-type="other" id="P-611" rid="P-611"/></p><fig id="bhm-90-3-611-g001" fig-type="zoom" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Wilhelm Braune, <italic>The Position of the Uterus and Foetus at the End of Pregnancy.

For &#x0201c;such an elaborate mechanism as the human body,&#x0201d; he explained, &#x0201c;every line must be true to nature and copied with the greatest care.&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f02">2</xref></sup> Drawings of the tracings, vividly rendered as folio-size color lithographs, were reproduced, debated, and emulated in dozens of publications during what one participant&#x02019;s history called the &#x0201c;Ice Age&#x0201d; of anatomy and obstetrics between around 1870 and 1910.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f03">3</xref></sup> Negotiations over the &#x0201c;truthfulness&#x0201d; of this representational technique during this period offer a reach seam of commentary on the purpose of anatomy and its relevance to clinical medicine.</p><p>Long praised for their visual sophistication, Braune&#x02019;s plates are part of the modern canon of anatomical illustration.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f04">4</xref></sup> Recently, they have been claimed as ancestors of the digitally photographed cryosections that compose the &#x0201c;Visible Human&#x0201d; datasets launched in the mid-1990s and even computerized tomography (CT) scans now in routine clinical use.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f05">5</xref></sup> More serious assessments have attributed frozen sections to a post-Enlightenment tradition of unflinching realism that produced &#x0201c;stylistically sober&#x0201d; portrayals of the body analogous to an architectural drawing or technical plan.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f06">6</xref></sup> It is perhaps also tempting to see frozen sections as representatives of a wider regime of objectivity in scientific images around 1900. In the nineteenth century, Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison have argued, an ideal of representation that permitted manipulation in order to depict types was <xref ref-type="other" id="P-613" rid="P-613"/> challenged by a &#x0201c;mechanical objectivity&#x0201d; committed to self-restraint and the unadorned depiction of individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f07">7</xref></sup> These interpretations capture something important, but are either too general to explain the arguments for and against frozen sections during their heyday or too focused on Braune&#x02019;s plates to account for the fate of the technique in others&#x02019; hands.</p><p>Taken up at institutes across Europe, the British Empire, and North America around 1900, frozen sectioning was poised between dissection and the many strategies used to produce &#x0201c;visual displays&#x0201d; for teaching and research.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f08">8</xref></sup> Nineteenth-century anatomy professors considered dissection essential for inculcating in students the observational skills and manual dexterity required for surgery. While illustrations, models, and preparations were often disparaged as works of art rather than science, these were nevertheless ubiquitous pedagogical tools. Such emerging specialties as histology, pathology, and embryology worked around the growing dominance of dissection to carve out new roles for visual aids designed to communicate knowledge of objects that were especially small, rare, complex, or transient. Anatomists, artists, and technicians experimented with a bewildering array of techniques for rendering bodies and body parts for classrooms, museums, and publications.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f09">9</xref></sup> With so many methods to choose from, why adopt frozen sectioning?</p><p>Enthusiasts credited the technique with no less than revolutionizing understanding of &#x0201c;topography&#x0201d; of the body. This was because frozen sections offered special advantages in demonstrating complex spatial relationships and were allegedly more faithful to living anatomy than existing methods of study. But some medical practitioners doubted that frozen sections were either truthful or useful, maintaining that anatomical knowledge flowed only from direct engagement with bodies, dead and alive. To understand these positions, we need to go beyond comparing isolated pictures to recover the changing social relations of their production and use. In assessments of frozen sections, widely available attitudes <xref ref-type="other" id="P-614" rid="P-614"/> to faithful representation were refracted through disciplinary agendas and struggles over resources.</p><p>This essay concentrates on the reception of frozen sectioning in Britain, where the politics of the technique, bound up in little researched deliberations over the status of anatomy and the usefulness of dissection, are especially clear. Histories of medical education around 1900 give the impression that the ascendant laboratory sciences rendered anatomy virtually irrelevant within the preclinical curriculum, while writing on corpse supply to medicine has tended to treat the subject as synonymous with dissection.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f10">10</xref></sup> Yet frozen sectioning arrived in Britain on a wave of investment in new facilities for anatomical instruction in the late nineteenth century, and cadavers were still much in demand for research, including within clinical disciplines such as surgery and obstetrics. For although dissection is usually seen as the sum total of anatomical practice, negotiations over frozen sections demonstrate that clinicians continued to participate in the field and sought to shape the methods through which it was studied and taught.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f11">11</xref></sup> After outlining general claims made for and against frozen sections, I trace their use in British anatomy and obstetrics as research tools and teaching devices and show that anatomists&#x02019; and clinicians&#x02019; disputes over the technique hinged on divergent commitments to tactile and visual knowledge.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f12">12</xref></sup> Reconstructing these debates over the epistemological standing of hand and eye both helps to grasp what was at stake for advocates and critics and expands our understanding of the place of anatomy in medicine around 1900.</p><sec><title>The &#x0201c;Freezing Method&#x0201d;</title><p>Frozen sections came to prominence in Germany within one of the many specialized research programs to emerge from the breakup of anatomy in the mid-nineteenth century. This was &#x0201c;topographical&#x0201d; anatomy, which <xref ref-type="other" id="P-615" rid="P-615"/> analyzed the body regionally rather than by organ system or tissue type, as was more conventional. Though disparaged by practitioners of morphology, the study of organic form, as too descriptive and insufficiently scientific, topographical anatomy claimed greater relevance to the practical needs of the clinic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f13">13</xref></sup></p><p>By the 1880s several of the larger German universities accommodated the anatomical orientations favored by clinicians and those preferred by preclinical scientists by dividing teaching between two chairs. At Leipzig the former military surgeon Wilhelm Braune taught human topographical anatomy and Wilhelm His comparative anatomy, embryology, and histology. Both professors practiced a &#x0201c;mechanical&#x0201d; anatomy allied to the physicalist physiology of their colleague Carl Ludwig. They argued that the form of the human body could not be understood apart from function, nor development without mechanical principles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f14">14</xref></sup> Braune helped to unite topographical and physiological orientations by using sections to research the mechanics of stance and gait.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f15">15</xref></sup></p><p>Braune systematized a method of cutting sections from frozen corpses rather than the usual specimens preserved for weeks in spirits. A few nineteenth-century anatomists had experimented with frozen sectioning, but the technique was little known until Braune&#x02019;s <italic>Topographisch-anatomischer Atlas</italic> (1867&#x02013;72).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f16">16</xref></sup> This was part of a wider Central European trend of importing resources from analytical mechanics, the physical sciences, and industry to develop new techniques of manipulating, visualizing, and preserving anatomical structures.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f17">17</xref></sup> Traditionally, anatomical preparation making required skill and experience, and &#x0201c;preparators&#x0201d; could guard <xref ref-type="other" id="P-616" rid="P-616"/> their methods jealously.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f18">18</xref></sup> Frozen sectioning was in theory &#x0201c;open to all,&#x0201d; or at least to those with access to large institutes and research material.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f19">19</xref></sup> In the 1880s, the technique was confined to the top medical schools and few students would have encountered a frozen section directly. By 1900, however, the &#x0201c;freezing method&#x0201d; was practiced across Europe, North America, and the British Empire.</p><fig id="bhm-90-3-611-g002" fig-type="zoom" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Transverse section cut just below the larynx, from Braune&#x02019;s <italic>Topographisch-anatomischer Atlas</italic> (Leipzig, 1872; plate VII), color lithograph (56 &#x000d7; 39 cm) by C.

Widely used before electrical refrigeration, saline freezing mixtures brought the temperature inside a vessel to as low as minus <xref ref-type="other" id="P-617" rid="P-617"/> twenty-one Celsius.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f20">20</xref></sup> Minus eighteen degrees was reckoned enough to freeze an adult human corpse solid, preserving soft, pliable organs in situ within around five days.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f21">21</xref></sup> The frozen cadaver was then sliced along various planes with a fine-toothed saw. Compared to the sophisticated apparatus used from the 1870s to cut serial sections of microscopic specimens, the method seems crude, but it took skill to slice sections uniformly without disturbing the internal viscera or tearing tissue as it thawed under the blade.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f22">22</xref></sup> Transverse sections (cut at right angles to the long axis of the body) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhm-90-3-611-g002">Figure 2</xref>) were around an inch thick, full-length sagittal sections (cut along the long axis of the body from front to back) thicker still. Practitioners either drew the sections while the tissue remained frozen, or allowed them to thaw and harden in alcohol. Thawed sections could be preserved in spirits and mounted for museum display.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f23">23</xref></sup></p><p>Braune promoted frozen sections as faithfully preserved living tissue. He and other adherents drew on animal experiments showing that the vital functions of vertebrates could survive freezing and thawing and on histological knowledge that &#x0201c;sections of a perfectly fresh tissue which has been frozen will most closely represent living structure.&#x0201d; Freezing was the most &#x0201c;truthful&#x0201d; method of making microscopic or anatomical preparations, allegedly keeping structures intact and leaving colors unadulterated by such fixing agents as chromic acid.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f24">24</xref></sup></p><p>Enthusiasts also claimed that the method allowed anatomists quickly and easily to translate the three-dimensional complexity of the body into two-dimensional representations. Braune&#x02019;s technique of tracing onto a sheet of wax paper or glass placed directly on the frozen surface of the <xref ref-type="other" id="P-618" rid="P-618"/> section seemed to guarantee an almost effortless accuracy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f25">25</xref></sup> &#x0201c;Few students of anatomy attain sufficient command over pen, pencil and brush to be able to make rapid satisfactory freehand drawings,&#x0201d; but even those with no artistic skill could rapidly trace the outlines of organs from the flat surface of a freshly cut section.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f26">26</xref></sup> Yet Braune relied on artists to turn his tracings into vivid lithographs, providing samples of fresh tissue to make &#x0201c;the drawing-in of the parts . . . clear and correct.&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f27">27</xref></sup> His representations were explicitly manipulated and idealized to mimic life. A few practitioners photographed the sections directly, but, like Braune, most had artists convert their drawings into lithographs for publication.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f28">28</xref></sup> Photography provided neither the clarity nor the color of labeled drawings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f29">29</xref></sup> So while commitment to accuracy was paramount, faithfulness to the original object did not imply a ban on human intervention. The advantage was rather that the technique imposed continuity on representational routines and placed the burden on the anatomist&#x02019;s work rather than the preparator&#x02019;s skill or the artist&#x02019;s impression. Because the technique eliminated the need to draw anatomical structures in perspective, both cut sections and drawings could be interpreted in two dimensions and were therefore directly comparable.</p><p>Allegedly the &#x0201c;most . . . popular textbook of topographical anatomy in Germany&#x0201d; by the late 1870s, Braune&#x02019;s atlas stimulated much work using frozen sectioning.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f30">30</xref></sup> The other leading exponents were also teachers of human topographical anatomy who pursued a mechanical approach to the body in their research. Some practitioners followed Braune by sectioning whole adult cadavers; others focused on infants and children or such complex regions of the body as head, thorax, or pelvis. By the 1880s, wood engravings, lithographs, and photogravures of frozen sections circulated internationally in the leading textbooks, not only of human anatomy, <xref ref-type="other" id="P-619" rid="P-619"/> but also increasingly of clinical disciplines and veterinary medicine.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f31">31</xref></sup> Anatomists exchanged practical knowledge of the technique at professional societies, and meticulously described and debated frozen sections in research publications.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f32">32</xref></sup> Recognizing that these were the preparations &#x0201c;the student and the practitioner most desire[d] to see,&#x0201d; museum conservators improved methods for mounting frozen sections for permanent display.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f33">33</xref></sup> As the technique became more widely known, however, claims about the advantages of frozen sections were subjected to greater scrutiny.</p></sec><sec><title>Fallacy in Frozen Sectioning</title><p>Judgments about the value of the freezing method hinged on two related issues: the relative merits of frozen sections compared to dissection and their usefulness to clinicians. Nineteenth-century medical educators venerated dissection as essential preparation for practice. They considered dissecting room experience necessary for forming professional character, cultivating manual dexterity and teaching students to recognize complex structures. So it was a bold move for topographical anatomists to claim frozen sectioning as an advance on &#x0201c;old-fashioned&#x0201d; &#x0201c;scalpel and forceps&#x0201d; dissecting. More &#x0201c;faithful&#x0201d; anatomy, they insisted, would do &#x0201c;the clinician a real service&#x0201d; by encouraging better diagnoses and safer surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f34">34</xref></sup></p><p>Adherents asserted that frozen sections compared favorably with &#x0201c;ordinary methods of dissecting, in the determination of the exact position and relations of the viscera and other structures.&#x0201d; Braune&#x02019;s technique had &#x0201c;dispelled&#x0201d; &#x0201c;many erroneous ideas.&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f35">35</xref></sup> One proponent compared viewing a frozen section to seeing a jellyfish in its natural habitat: &#x0201c;the living embodiment of symmetry and beauty propelling itself through the clear blue water&#x0201d;; a corpse dissected in the &#x0201c;old-fashioned&#x0201d; manner, by contrast, was like a jellyfish &#x0201c;half embedded in the sand, a shapeless and repulsive mass.&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f36">36</xref></sup><xref ref-type="other" id="P-620" rid="P-620"/></p><p>Such arguments provoked three criticisms. The first came typically from research anatomists who accepted the freezing method as valuable in principle, but had reservations about deductions from single frozen sections. Against those who treated sections like architectural plans from which viewers would derive &#x0201c;mental pictures&#x0201d; of the living body, these critics argued that the sections should be seen as a means to an end, rather than finished products.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f37">37</xref></sup> Anatomists should work through serial sections to produce graphic reconstructions of particular organ systems or regions of the body, or model individual organs in plaster or wood.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f38">38</xref></sup> From the mid-1890s, formalin challenged freezing as a preservative that hardened corpses so they held their shape during cutting and mounting and could be kept indefinitely. Sections of a formalin-fixed cadaver could be dismantled and individual organs reassembled in &#x0201c;the fashion of a child&#x02019;s model house.&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f39">39</xref></sup> But many anatomists continued for some years to use both methods.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f40">40</xref></sup></p><p>A second critique suggested that frozen sections, however accurate, tended to confuse the uninitiated. Even enthusiasts who reckoned these &#x0201c;anatomical puzzles&#x0201d; became more intelligible through familiarity conceded that viewers approached them with &#x0201c;bewilderment.&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f41">41</xref></sup> Unsurprisingly, then, many teachers of anatomy regarded frozen sections as beyond the capabilities of most students.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f42">42</xref></sup> Detractors argued that since frozen sections depicted only (potentially abnormal) individuals, they could not compete with the collective knowledge built up through centuries of &#x0201c;scalpel and forceps&#x0201d; dissection and examining living subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f43">43</xref></sup></p><p>The third, and most fundamental, criticism dismissed as fallacious the claim that freezing kept the organs and viscera in the positions they <xref ref-type="other" id="P-621" rid="P-621"/> assumed during life. Detractors, typically clinicians who wanted anatomical knowledge from cadavers subservient to bedside experience, argued to the contrary that the freezing process altered the size, proportion, and relations of parts: &#x0201c;the turgor of life,&#x0201d; one suggested, &#x0201c;is very different from the shrunken condition of the corpse.&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f44">44</xref></sup> Many agreed that frozen sections by Braune and others gave a misleading impression of the shape, position, and texture of parts in the living body, making all tissues appear alike and conveying nothing of their elasticity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f45">45</xref></sup> Jena gynecologist Otto K&#x000fc;stner greeted an anatomist&#x02019;s intervention with evidence from frozen sections in a long-running debate over the normal position of the uterus with the stroppy retort, &#x0201c;we poor gynecologists with our touching fingers groping around in the darkness of inexactness, look up reverently and expectantly to the mother of all medical science, anatomy.&#x0201d; All too often, the gynecologist complained, &#x0201c;anatomical investigation . . . leads us astray.&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f46">46</xref></sup></p><p>These arguments indicate the variety of objections to the freezing method promoted by topographical anatomists. Some researchers found it sufficient only when using sections to reconstruct 3-D views. Many clinicians dismissed frozen sections as misleading or of limited applicability in teaching. For a better grasp of these positions and the interests behind them, the rest of this essay focuses on the prominent debate over frozen sections in Britain.</p></sec><sec><title>The Varieties of British Anatomy, ca. 1900</title><p>Frozen sectioning arrived in Britain amid growing debate over the purpose and relevance of anatomy. Late nineteenth-century medical schools began to set new standards for preclinical education by emphasizing laboratory training, especially in physiology and pathology. Meanwhile, teachers in clinical subjects pressed for a greater share of the curriculum to be given to practical bedside instruction. These pressures forced anatomists <xref ref-type="other" id="P-622" rid="P-622"/> to justify the continued significance of their discipline.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f47">47</xref></sup> Complaints about run-down dissecting rooms with insufficient cadavers, unenthusiastic teaching, and inadequate examinations reinforced concerns that anatomy was in crisis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f48">48</xref></sup></p><p>Late nineteenth-century anatomists saw themselves as either clinicians or career academics. The dominant approach was &#x0201c;surgical anatomy,&#x0201d; an orientation for which the London hospital schools were renowned.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f49">49</xref></sup> Most London anatomy teachers lectured part-time but derived most of their income and status from surgery. Research was &#x0201c;quite a voluntary effort&#x0201d; for part-time instructors who identified as surgeons, and had &#x0201c;little time to keep themselves abreast of the advancing state of the science.&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f50">50</xref></sup> They viewed anatomy as a stepping-stone to a more prestigious post in clinical medicine, teaching anatomy as the &#x0201c;handmaiden of surgery&#x0201d; and dissection as the practical foundation of a surgical career.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f51">51</xref></sup> The leading textbook, <italic>Gray&#x02019;s Anatomy</italic>, exemplified this utilitarian orientation, drawing a direct line between the illustrations, the experience of dissection, and the practice of surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f52">52</xref></sup></p><p>By around 1870, a few anatomists had begun to distinguish themselves from the clinicians who dominated teaching of the subject. The expansion of provincial schools, together with the growth of preclinical education at the Scottish universities and later Oxford and Cambridge, created opportunities for teachers identifying themselves as career academics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f53">53</xref></sup> Concerned that territory lost to physiology and other experimental <xref ref-type="other" id="P-623" rid="P-623"/> disciplines had left anatomy departments sterile, this group insisted that the subject should be a science in its own right. These self-styled &#x0201c;scientific&#x0201d; anatomists found models for reform in German universities, where full-time professors advanced their field with original research.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f54">54</xref></sup> From university-based medical schools outside London, scientific anatomists sought to define their field as the &#x0201c;highest branch of biology,&#x0201d; emphasizing embryology, histology, and comparative anatomy as the pillars of instruction in morphology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f55">55</xref></sup></p><p>Some scientific anatomists disparaged surgical approaches as diminishing their discipline, but most dared not push this argument too far lest it detach &#x0201c;pure&#x0201d; anatomy from students&#x02019; requirements altogether.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f56">56</xref></sup> As physiology and other laboratory-based subjects jostled for space in increasingly congested curricula, anatomists fought to preserve their status as custodians of preclinical medicine. Many among the new generation of academic anatomists were keen to secure their discipline&#x02019;s identity as a science without sacrificing its clinical relevance. Committed to introducing better remuneration for full-time academic work, teachers were also concerned to revitalize anatomy as a research subject for both professional anatomists and practicing clinicians.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f57">57</xref></sup> By the 1890s, there was broad agreement that anatomical instruction should be more closely aligned with practitioners&#x02019; needs. But rather than return to traditional surgical approaches, these younger teachers sought to expand the repertoire of anatomical pedagogy beyond dissection, emphasizing instead the value of small-group demonstrations, independent study, and practical training in research techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f58">58</xref></sup> Many departments also began to provide facilities for clinicians to participate in anatomical research and offered new courses in German-style topographical anatomy&#x02014;sometimes termed &#x0201c;regional&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;applied&#x0201d; anatomy&#x02014;for advanced undergraduates and post-graduates. <xref ref-type="other" id="P-624" rid="P-624"/> How did this shifting disciplinary landscape shape the British reception of frozen sectioning?</p></sec><sec><title>Between &#x0201c;Fashionable&#x0201d; Preparations and &#x0201c;the True Anatomy&#x0201d;</title><p>In 1879, the Royal College of Surgeons of England had a British student of Braune&#x02019;s make frozen sections for display at the Hunterian Museum in London to &#x0201c;supplement&#x0201d; its already &#x0201c;splendid collection.&#x0201d; The consensus was soon that &#x0201c;every good teaching museum should have its <italic>repertoire</italic> of such specimens.&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f59">59</xref></sup> As medical institutions both in and outside London invested in new facilities for anatomical teaching at the end of the century, space and resources were set aside for these most &#x0201c;fashionable&#x0201d; preparations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f60">60</xref></sup> The variety and quality of preparations had long been signs of an anatomical school&#x02019;s vitality and an important means of attracting students.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f61">61</xref></sup> Schools now highlighted their collections of frozen sections as an indication that their anatomical department had been improved for teaching purposes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f62">62</xref></sup> Despite broad agreement that frozen sectioning was a valuable new resource, surgical and scientific anatomists differed about what those purposes should be.</p><p>These fissures were first apparent in Edinburgh, where anatomists took a leading role in establishing the new technique in the 1880s. The major rival to London as Britain&#x02019;s foremost center of medical education, Edinburgh was the largest and most prestigious of the Scottish universities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f63">63</xref></sup> In William Turner, the university also had the country&#x02019;s preeminent scientific anatomist. A full-time professor since 1867, he was committed to anatomy teaching in the German style, from the morphological as well as the surgical point of view, by career academics involved in research. With new facilities for anatomical instruction prioritized within a broader program <xref ref-type="other" id="P-625" rid="P-625"/> of institutional redevelopment during the 1870s and 1880s, Turner looked on German universities, especially Leipzig, as models for rebuilding his department. Combined with systematic lectures and dissecting classes, small group demonstrations in human topographical anatomy were a cornerstone of teaching at Edinburgh from the mid-1870s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f64">64</xref></sup></p><p>Impressed by Braune&#x02019;s innovations in frozen sectioning, Turner made the technique central to the activity of his refurbished department, opened in 1880.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f65">65</xref></sup> Generations of demonstrators recruited to assist with teaching were encouraged to regard frozen sectioning as a means of advancing knowledge in human anatomy. The most famous of these, Daniel Cunningham, who succeeded Turner as professor in 1905, used frozen sections to reconstruct wooden models of the &#x0201c;true forms&#x0201d; of the human stomach, kidney, liver, and spleen.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f66">66</xref></sup> Equipping practicing clinicians with &#x0201c;more precise&#x0201d; anatomical knowledge, Turner and his prot&#x000e9;g&#x000e9;s argued, would give &#x0201c;greater definition&#x0201d; to their diagnoses and interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f67">67</xref></sup></p><p>Produced in abundance for research, frozen sections also gained an important role in the department&#x02019;s teaching. In practical anatomy classes, students typically encountered dismembered, often decayed corpses, fulfilling the requirement to dissect an entire body part by part, often over several years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f68">68</xref></sup> Then there was the shortage of cadavers, a perennial source of concern for anatomy instructors in Edinburgh; in 1880, 650 students shared a meager eighty-five bodies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f69">69</xref></sup> These constraints, the teachers <xref ref-type="other" id="P-626" rid="P-626"/> alleged, made it difficult to visualize the whole, living body. Studying the sectioned frozen cadavers displayed in the university&#x02019;s &#x0201c;magnificent&#x0201d; new dissecting hall was &#x0201c;necessary to correct . . . impressions gained by dissection,&#x0201d; which &#x0201c;artificially&#x0201d; separated parts and &#x0201c;disturbed&#x0201d; relations.&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f70">70</xref></sup> Students learned to make reconstruction drawings of organs from serial sections, and where resources allowed, the more advanced were encouraged to produce their own. Through sustained engagement with sections a pupil &#x0201c;gradually builds up in his own mind a picture of the human body,&#x0201d; considered impossible through piecemeal dissection alone. At the university, then, studying frozen sections was part of the &#x0201c;mental training in exact observation&#x0201d; Turner considered the key to a higher anatomy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f71">71</xref></sup></p><p>Like many Scottish anatomists, Turner contrasted his approach with what he portrayed as the narrowly &#x0201c;professional&#x0201d; training on offer in London. But even as he built up the university department as a bastion of anatomical science, a second group of teachers in Edinburgh cultivated a parallel pedagogical tradition that resembled the London model. Existing alongside the university was an &#x0201c;extramural&#x0201d; medical school, which taught for the diplomas of the corporate licensing bodies, the Royal Colleges of Physicians and of Surgeons. A long-standing source of competition to the professoriate, these independent teachers attracted students by targeting perceived weaknesses in the university curriculum.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f72">72</xref></sup> In the 1880s, many still claimed that anatomy could be effectively taught only in relation to practical surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f73">73</xref></sup> Especially dangerous for Turner&#x02019;s department were the courses in surgical anatomy run by the senior clinical staff of the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, who had first access to &#x0201c;teaching material.&#x0201d; Seeking to exploit student grievances about the limited opportunities in the city for hands-on experience, these courses promised anatomical instruction tied closely to clinical pathology and operative surgery. For these teachers, <xref ref-type="other" id="P-627" rid="P-627"/> students should &#x0201c;view and study anatomy through surgical spectacles&#x0201d; either at the bedside on living patients, or in the postmortem room.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f74">74</xref></sup></p><p>In judging frozen sections, these surgically oriented teachers drew on long-standing assumptions about the role visual aids should play in anatomical pedagogy. While preparations, plates, and models were pervasive in classrooms, generations of educators had denied that they could ever rival dissection.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f75">75</xref></sup> Although preparations were better established and more tolerated than either drawings or models, the dominant view among surgeons was that visual aids all too often distracted students from gaining direct experience handling and observing corpses. Because surgery was a &#x0201c;handicraft,&#x0201d; teachers argued, &#x0201c;costly apparatus, splendid cabinets, magnificent plates&#x0201d; were mere diversions, useless for building students&#x02019; confidence with knife and forceps.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f76">76</xref></sup></p><p>Surgeons by and large tolerated frozen sections as preparations so long as they were used &#x0201c;merely for reference or for the completion of the anatomical series.&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f77">77</xref></sup> One of Edinburgh&#x02019;s leading surgeons, James Spence, thus accepted in 1881 that frozen sections were &#x0201c;useful aids in their proper place,&#x0201d; but denied they had any bearing on the cultivation of the &#x0201c;clinical method,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;skilful . . . diagnosis and treatment of surgical disease.&#x0201d; Spence was typical in balancing praise for frozen sections as museum preparations with the warning that, like any visual aid, they were no substitutes for &#x0201c;actual careful dissection of the body, the student working <italic>for himself</italic>.&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f78">78</xref></sup> More generally, where drawings of frozen sections appeared in textbooks of surgical anatomy, they were always secondary to schematic diagrams that taught general principles, or representations that depicted the body as it would be seen in the dissecting room or operating theater.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f79">79</xref></sup><xref ref-type="other" id="P-628" rid="P-628"/></p><p>Surgeons viewed frozen sections as just one variety of visual aid among many. At the university, by contrast, the technique represented a novel way of studying human anatomy that exposed the didactic shortcomings of dissection. In what would become the leading English-language dissecting guide, Cunningham went so far as to write that &#x0201c;sectional anatomy is the true anatomy.&#x0201d; It was among Edinburgh-trained anatomists of Cunningham&#x02019;s generation that frozen sectioning would take hold. The technique offered them an attractive prospect: a &#x0201c;promising field of research&#x0201d; and a new orientation in anatomical instruction that was clinically relevant and yet distinct from the established surgical tradition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f80">80</xref></sup> By the mid-1890s, the university had formalized this aspect of training by instituting a new lectureship in &#x0201c;regional anatomy.&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f81">81</xref></sup> Anatomists justified the emphasis on frozen sectioning by pointing to the &#x0201c;extended range of modern surgery as a consequence of anaesthesia and antisepsis.&#x0201d; More interventionist, complex surgery, they argued, required a more accurate knowledge of the positions and relations of organs than dissection alone could provide.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f82">82</xref></sup></p><p>By now Edinburgh-trained anatomists were filling new full-time professorial chairs elsewhere. Twenty-three of Turner&#x02019;s former students went on to hold appointments at universities across the British Empire and North America, where many would promote the gospel that frozen sections were indispensable to anatomical teaching and research.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f83">83</xref></sup> But that is not the whole story. While anatomists were the main users, frozen sectioning also attracted a second group in Edinburgh.</p></sec><sec><title>Reforming Obstetric Anatomy</title><p>Traditionally subordinate to medicine and surgery, obstetrics with gynecology had become prominent in nineteenth-century medical education. Courses in these subjects had substantial anatomical components; teachers had long claimed that advanced knowledge of anatomy, transmitted through formal training, distinguished the (male) &#x0201c;science of obstetrics&#x0201d; <xref ref-type="other" id="P-629" rid="P-629"/> from the (female) &#x0201c;art of midwifery.&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f84">84</xref></sup> Nineteenth-century obstetricians judged Scottish-born man-midwife William Hunter&#x02019;s 1774 <italic>Anatomy of the Human Gravid Uterus</italic> an unsurpassed &#x0201c;masterpiece . . . of careful dissection and accurate drawing.&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f85">85</xref></sup> But female cadavers were notoriously scarce and tended to be reserved for anatomical or surgical instruction. Obstetric teachers therefore relied heavily on textbook diagrams, models, plates, and specimens to instruct students in normal female anatomy and the various stages of pregnancy and parturition, together with all manner of diseases and complications.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f86">86</xref></sup> How did frozen sections inform obstetric approaches to studying anatomy?</p><p>Published in 1872 as a supplement to his atlas, Braune&#x02019;s pregnancy plates alerted &#x0201c;adventurous obstetricians&#x0201d; to the potential of frozen sectioning to refine their understanding of the anatomy of the gravid uterus. The plates had soon &#x0201c;attained wide circulation&#x0201d; in Edinburgh, where obstetrics was unusually well established.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f87">87</xref></sup></p><p>The university had Britain&#x02019;s oldest midwifery chair, held since 1870 by Alexander Russell Simpson, nephew of previous incumbent and anesthetic pioneer James Young Simpson. An Obstetrical Society, founded in 1839 to promote this emerging specialism as a formal branch of medicine, encouraged both corporate identity and scientific enterprise. Long before frozen sections arrived, obstetricians in Edinburgh were accustomed to associating the collection, preparation, display, and discussion of anatomical and pathological specimens, drawings, and models with the advancement of both individual careers and the standing of their discipline.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f88">88</xref></sup> The university <xref ref-type="other" id="P-630" rid="P-630"/> justified A. R. Simpson&#x02019;s appointment on the grounds that the new professor would have &#x0201c;the advantage of possessing his uncle&#x02019;s invaluable museum, medical library, diagrams, apparatus, and other appurtenances used in lecturing.&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f89">89</xref></sup> Simpson earned a reputation as a cosmopolitan and progressive instructor, his teaching &#x0201c;filled with the latest obstetric knowledge of the Continent.&#x0201d; If his enthusiasm for frozen-section anatomy was motivated by a concern to improve the university&#x02019;s teaching apparatus with the latest in German innovations, it was also grounded in a commitment to advancing obstetrics and gynecology with &#x0201c;serious scientific research.&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f90">90</xref></sup></p><p>By around 1880, a handful of European obstetricians and gynecologists were making their own frozen sections, though always fewer than the anatomists who were better positioned to access cadavers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f91">91</xref></sup> Inspired by these continental exemplars, Simpson encouraged his best students to seize opportunities to advance obstetric science, rather than merely receiving knowledge from anatomy. At the same time, then, that anatomists in Turner&#x02019;s department were adopting frozen sectioning, Simpson led a generation of his own prot&#x000e9;g&#x000e9;s in using the technique to cultivate a parallel tradition of obstetric anatomy. A stream of influential studies on the sectional anatomy of the female pelvis and fetus prompted other obstetricians and even anatomists to recognize a distinctive &#x0201c;Edinburgh School&#x0201d; of obstetrics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f92">92</xref></sup></p><p>Together with Simpson, two students in particular, David Berry Hart and Alexander Hugh Freeland Barbour (Simpson&#x02019;s son-in-law), made frozen sectioning central to their identities as &#x0201c;scientific obstetricians.&#x0201d; Having adopted the technique while working as Simpson&#x02019;s teaching assistants in the early 1880s, both moved into extramural lectureships and, soon after, clinical positions at Edinburgh&#x02019;s major lying-in hospital, the Royal Maternity, and on the gynecological wards of the Royal Infirmary. Members of the senior clinical staff at these institutions were permitted to make use of the bodies of deceased patients for teaching and research. Simpson, Hart, and Barbour succeeded in claiming some of this material for frozen sectioning, including rare corpses of pregnant women who had died in labor. In a body of work spanning around three decades, <xref ref-type="other" id="P-631" rid="P-631"/> they would contend that obstetricians and gynecologists, who seldom had opportunities to dissect, could learn most from scarce resources by embracing sectional anatomy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f93">93</xref></sup></p><p>Hart and Barbour achieved international recognition with their <italic>Manual of Gynecology</italic> (1882), which carried many drawings of frozen sections and insisted that sectional anatomy should form the very foundations of obstetric and gynecological pedagogy and practice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f94">94</xref></sup> In this and other publications, the authors reiterated anatomists&#x02019; general arguments for the technique: that frozen sections came &#x0201c;closest to [capturing] the actual condition&#x0201d; of the living body and were the most effective means of studying the &#x0201c;true&#x0201d; positions and relations of parts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f95">95</xref></sup> But despite the common ground, there were important differences in emphasis.</p><p>First, obstetricians of the Edinburgh School highlighted the potential of the technique for investigating dynamic physiological and pathological processes beyond static structures. Barbour, for instance, concentrated on the mechanism of labor, comparing sections cut from the cadavers of women who had died at different stages of advanced pregnancy to build &#x0201c;an instructive picture&#x0201d; of the changes in the shape and position of the uterus, fetus, and placenta during childbirth. For Barbour, collecting a &#x0201c;complete series of sections from every stage&#x0201d; would enable obstetricians to &#x0201c;read the changes&#x0201d; as if they were &#x0201c;turning over the pages of a book&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhm-90-3-611-g003">Figure 3</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f96">96</xref></sup></p><p>Second, obstetricians invoked frozen sections to critique the casual use of pictures within their discipline. Unlike anatomists, they were not interested in using sections to reconstruct 3-D views, but engaged with drawings of bodies bisected along a single plane. Representations of the female pelvis in cross section had long been a fixture of obstetric works. <xref ref-type="other" id="P-632" rid="P-632"/> For Edinburgh obstetricians, frozen sections were more authentic than these &#x0201c;diagrammatic&#x0201d; illustrations of medical theories, surgical procedures, and diagnostic techniques. Claiming to show &#x0201c;things exactly as they are,&#x0201d; they contrasted the &#x0201c;<italic>representing</italic> of portions of the body as they might appear in section from the <italic>making</italic> of sections as a means of investigation.&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f97">97</xref></sup> Barbour explained that with frozen sections,</p><disp-quote><p>Nothing is left to the imagination. It is remarkable how much of what we are accustomed to regard as &#x02018;knowledge&#x02019; is imaginary; we get one fact, and fill in all the rest from the imagination. We have only to compare any of the numerous diagrams in obstetrical works with an actual section to see how many erroneous ideas creep in with the single fact which the diagram was intended to express.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f98">98</xref></sup></p></disp-quote><p content-type="continued">In other words, obstetricians should not be content with &#x0201c;mere&#x0201d; diagrams, but should inform their teaching and practice with &#x0201c;actual&#x0201d; anatomical research.</p><fig id="bhm-90-3-611-g003" fig-type="zoom" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Lithograph of a vertical section of the uterus before labor, from Alexander H.

During Simpson&#x02019;s tenure, the university required degree students to attend a six-month course in midwifery, with one lecture per week on the diseases of women. For a medical license, students needed only three months of midwifery. These constraints meant that a significant portion of gynecological instruction, including in the anatomy of female pelvis, was left to dissecting classes, or general medicine and surgery. Edinburgh obstetricians maintained that this unsystematic training was inadequate. Their work in frozen sectioning both exposed curricular failings and bolstered demands for more gynecological instruction by specialists. The university recognized this need by creating a separate lectureship in gynecology, awarded to Barbour on Simpson&#x02019;s retirement in 1905.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f103">103</xref></sup> In his new position, Barbour promoted sectional anatomy as ideal for preclinical teaching. Depicting &#x0201c;relations of parts as they are found in the living subject,&#x0201d; drawings of frozen sections introduced students to the form, size, and <xref ref-type="other" id="P-634" rid="P-634"/> position of normal and pathological structures that they would later learn to recognize at the bedside.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f104">104</xref></sup></p><p>Beyond teaching, however, members of the Edinburgh School sought to establish a lineage for frozen sections as part of an independent tradition of obstetric anatomy going back to Hunter.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f105">105</xref></sup> These practitioners found encouragement in a medical culture increasingly favorable to research. Obstetricians were among the first clinicians to make use of the new Laboratory of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, opened in 1887 to provide research facilities and diagnostic services for the local medical elite.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f106">106</xref></sup> Obstetric advocates of frozen sectioning also benefited from a fund established by the college to subsidize the cost of preparing illustrations for their publications, as well as numerous bequests to the university to foster &#x0201c;original scientific work&#x0201d; by younger members of the profession.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f107">107</xref></sup> The main setting for these investigations was the Obstetrical Society, which in 1883 convened a special committee to &#x0201c;induce Fellows to preserve for exhibition and examination preparations they might have been ready to throw aside as useless.&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f108">108</xref></sup></p><p>Presenting preparations and drawings of frozen sections also in the Medico-Chirurgical Society, the Pathological Club and the Royal Physical Society allowed a form of &#x0201c;virtual witnessing&#x0201d; of the fruits of the Edinburgh School&#x02019;s research by the city&#x02019;s medical elite.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f109">109</xref></sup> Collective judgments about the credibility of individual reports worked to build consensus that frozen sectioning had inaugurated &#x0201c;a new era in obstetrics,&#x0201d; providing both &#x0201c;anatomical facts&#x0201d; and a new pictorial idiom that should form the &#x0201c;immediate basis of clinical work.&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f110">110</xref></sup> Under Simpson&#x02019;s leadership, Hart and Barbour established a set of procedural and representational conventions in obstetric anatomy that subsequent generations would be encouraged, even obliged, to emulate.

For although praise for the technique overwhelmed any significant dissent in the Scottish capital, not all medical practitioners accepted frozen sections as the &#x0201c;true anatomy.&#x0201d;</p><p>Advocates of frozen sectioning claimed that the new technique promised to put clinical work on a secure &#x0201c;anatomical basis,&#x0201d; with more &#x0201c;correct&#x0201d; views of the body than could be obtained by any other method. In adopting this strategy, Edinburgh anatomists and obstetricians met with skepticism, even hostility, from counterparts elsewhere, and especially in London. Here, elite medical culture differed from that of Edinburgh. Hospital schools, rather than universities, dominated medical education, research was a relative rarity, and specialization was denigrated as fostering narrow-mindedness. Hospital doctors were often distrustful of innovations derived from the preclinical sciences, which they perceived as undermining the physician&#x02019;s holistic and intuitive clinical skills. On the contrary, diagnostic and therapeutic judgment could be developed only through personal experience of practice itself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f111">111</xref></sup></p><p>Metropolitan clinicians deployed such rhetoric against sectional anatomy. Operating in a professional world that considered diagnostic acumen a higher virtue than specialist expertise, these physicians and surgeons tended to regard frozen sections as unwelcome infringements of their clinical authority. The default position here was that conclusions drawn from frozen sections &#x0201c;must harmonise with clinical phenomena to be accepted.&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f112">112</xref></sup> Robert Barnes, one of the country&#x02019;s best known gynecological surgeons, was typical among London-based clinicians in expressing his disdain for frozen sections. He discouraged treating sections as &#x0201c;trustworthy evidence of the position of pelvic organs.&#x0201d; Neither preparations nor pictures were able to convey &#x0201c;turgescence of the blood-vessels, the play of the muscles, and other vital conditions. . . . Clinical explorations, although seemingly less precise,&#x0201d; he argued, &#x0201c;give really better information.&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f113">113</xref></sup> For Barnes, the <italic>tactus eruditus</italic>, the educated touch, was the ultimate arbiter <xref ref-type="other" id="P-636" rid="P-636"/> of clinical truth. This could be cultivated, he insisted, only through long practice in &#x0201c;feeling the various conditions of form, size, consistency, and relations of the parts upon which this sense is to be exercised.&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f114">114</xref></sup> As purely anatomical evidence, frozen sections could therefore never supersede the &#x0201c;clinical method&#x0201d; derived from &#x0201c;unsurpassed experience.&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f115">115</xref></sup></p><p>Such views chimed with a broader ambivalence to frozen sectioning among London-based anatomy teachers. Continuing to see visual aids as either luxury adjuncts or &#x0201c;inadequate substitutes for dissection,&#x0201d; metropolitan surgical anatomists remained unconvinced by claims that frozen sections were essential classroom aids. Charles Lockwood, demonstrator of anatomy and operative surgery at Saint Bartholomew&#x02019;s Hospital, presented the standard suspicions to an audience at the British Medical Association annual meeting in 1888. Lockwood accepted that such preparations &#x0201c;may in a trifling degree assist in training the powers of observation,&#x0201d; but protested that they did nothing to teach &#x0201c;manual dexterity and the use of instruments, [or] familiarity with the appearance, texture, and consistence of the different tissues.&#x0201d; If the purpose of teaching anatomy was to discipline hand and eye, frozen sections privileged the latter at the expense of the former.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f116">116</xref></sup></p><p>No anatomist would have denied that dissection was the bedrock of medical training. But such criticisms pushed some university-based teachers, asserting themselves in debates about educational reform, to harden their stance. In the most provocative polemic in support of frozen sections yet, Alexander Macalister, recently appointed to the first full-time chair in anatomy at the University of Cambridge, argued in 1893 that there were &#x0201c;limitations of the utility of dissection.&#x0201d; Because dissection rendered the body &#x0201c;like the fallen Humpty-Dumpty,&#x0201d; frozen sections &#x0201c;were the only way of learning relations.&#x0201d; Sections, he insisted, were therefore not &#x0201c;mere superfluities&#x02014;ornamental adjuncts to a dissecting room [but] necessary parts of the teaching apparatus in any properly equipped school.&#x0201d; They were essential for enabling the practitioner, &#x0201c;without hesitation, to put his finger over or a needle into any structure of the body&#x0201d; and for &#x0201c;mentally picturing how the parts lie with regard to each other.&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f117">117</xref></sup> A full-time <xref ref-type="other" id="P-637" rid="P-637"/> academic in Turner&#x02019;s mold, Macalister defined himself as a scientific anatomist, committed to teaching the subject both systematically and topographically.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f118">118</xref></sup> He insisted that frozen sections and morphology alike invested &#x0201c;the whole subject with an interest which raises anatomy from the level of an engrossing handicraft . . . and makes it a science as well as an art, an exercise of the understanding as well as a training of the senses.&#x0201d; Both were essential elements of the &#x0201c;modern curriculum.&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f119">119</xref></sup></p><p>Macalister incited one London anatomy teacher to open revolt. Thomas Cooke, surgeon to the Westminster Hospital and the proprietor of a long-running private anatomy school, offered supplementary tuition to struggling students and access to corpses during the summer months, when the dissecting rooms of the hospital schools were closed. Several hospital-based anatomy teachers offered private lectures and demonstrations and many &#x0201c;coaches&#x0201d; helped struggling students prepare for exams, but Cooke&#x02019;s was the only private anatomy school recognized by the medical licensing bodies. Established in 1870, it thrived before being forced from permanent premises when a neighbor sued Cooke for endangering public health by running a dissection room in public view. By 1880, Cooke operated out of a temporary building in a disused Bloomsbury graveyard. Repeatedly threatened with closure, the school nevertheless survived into the twentieth century on a reputation for providing expert tuition to students who wanted more opportunities to dissect.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f120">120</xref></sup></p><p>Institutional insecurity made Cooke an unusually vocal commentator on transformations in anatomical teaching. Lacking prestige and resources, his business depended on student demand for supplementary dissecting and expectations that his courses were identical in content to those at the hospital schools, just better taught and tailored to individual needs. Threatened by a new breed of university-trained anatomist he punned were &#x0201c;divorced by degrees from the humble duties of the consulting room,&#x0201d; Cooke contrasted the &#x0201c;thoroughly honest practical work&#x0201d; of dissecting with the &#x0201c;lofty aspirations&#x0201d; of &#x0201c;scientific anatomy.&#x0201d; An 1893 pamphlet claimed that &#x0201c;scientific anatomists&#x0201d; had been lured &#x0201c;into the clouds of Dreamland&#x0201d; by morphology and the assumed &#x0201c;hyper-correctness&#x0201d; of the frozen section. &#x0201c;Neither [were] guides in operating, nor data verifiable <xref ref-type="other" id="P-638" rid="P-638"/> in dissecting&#x0201d; but led teachers down the &#x0201c;road of plates, diagrams, casts and the like.&#x0201d; Resentful of the superior resources of the universities and hospital schools, Cooke condemned the pretentions of &#x0201c;the favoured few who can keep a freezing tank&#x0201d; for neglecting their main responsibility to help students cultivate a &#x0201c;trained hand&#x0201d; for the clinic. &#x0201c;We should describe what can really and truly be seen by ordinary dissecting room processes as are within every student&#x02019;s rank, and nothing else,&#x0201d; he wrote of frozen sections; &#x0201c;to the practical mind, scientific truth is conformity to what one learns through one&#x02019;s own senses.&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f121">121</xref></sup></p><p>Claims that frozen sections were the best means of &#x0201c;learning relations&#x0201d; by Macalister and others drew outrage from Cooke in letters to <italic>Lancet</italic> and an extraordinary attack on what he termed &#x0201c;paper anatomists&#x0201d; in the tenth and eleventh editions of his dissecting guide <italic>Tablets of Anatomy</italic> (1894 and 1898). Cooke insisted that frozen sections were a fad and, like all visual aids, threatened to lead &#x0201c;the student away from the dissecting room, and injure him as a practical man.&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f122">122</xref></sup> Harking back to &#x0201c;the teaching of the good old time,&#x0201d; Cooke argued that only cultivation of tactile observation by dissection could train surgeons: &#x0201c;the <italic>digital</italic> eye is of more importance than the &#x02018;ocular.&#x02019;&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f123">123</xref></sup> Yet &#x0201c;paper anatomy,&#x0201d; he claimed, had pushed &#x0201c;dissecting-room anatomy [into] the background; for speculation is always more attractive than hard work.&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f124">124</xref></sup> The London surgeon Timothy Holmes, who edited <italic>Gray&#x02019;s Anatomy</italic> between 1864 and 1880, wrote to <italic>Lancet</italic> to agree with Cooke, who alleged he had the backing of other metropolitan anatomy teachers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f125">125</xref></sup> Yet other onlookers saw an outmoded &#x0201c;grinder&#x0201d; whose &#x0201c;denunciations&#x0201d; were &#x0201c;unbecoming.&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f126">126</xref></sup> Sneering commentaries on the controversy dismissed Cooke as a relic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f127">127</xref></sup></p><p>Cooke&#x02019;s struggles bear witness to larger shifts in British anatomy around 1900. Following Edinburgh&#x02019;s lead, anatomy was coming to be seen as a separate discipline, taught by career academics rather than part-time clinicians. Extramural teaching declined as &#x0201c;university education&#x0201d; was accepted as the standard, and students were expected to further their <xref ref-type="other" id="P-639" rid="P-639"/> training with periods of advanced study and research. Cooke may have been more prepared than other surgical anatomists to proclaim his contempt for frozen sections but was not without support. A <italic>Lancet</italic> editorial endorsed his complaint that dissection was becoming a &#x0201c;lost art,&#x0201d; ironically even as medical schools were expanding facilities for anatomical teaching and acquiring cadavers on an unprecedented scale.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f128">128</xref></sup> Cooke&#x02019;s claim that he had the private sympathy of exponents of what he termed the &#x0201c;old schools of anatomy&#x0201d; may not have been so far-fetched.</p><p>As the only licensed teacher of dissection in Britain with no affiliation to a medical school, Cooke was exceptional. Yet his campaign against &#x0201c;paper anatomy&#x0201d; brings surgeons&#x02019; ambivalence toward frozen sections&#x02014;and the modernizing project of scientific anatomy&#x02014;into sharper focus. Academic anatomists singled out frozen sections as necessary teaching apparatus that offered more than the models, plates, and even preparations routinely disparaged as distractions from dissecting room learning. Those who saw anatomy as a &#x0201c;handmaiden to surgery&#x0201d; did not recognize the distinction. For this group, teaching with &#x0201c;hyper-correct&#x0201d; frozen sections was to miss the point of anatomical instruction, to educate surgeons&#x02019; fingers rather than anatomists&#x02019; eyes. More than a competition for resources, the dispute was a contest over anatomy&#x02019;s very soul.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Around 1870 German topographical anatomists systematized a technique that had been known for decades, but only sporadically employed. In Britain, university anatomists adopted frozen sections as exemplary products of German science with which to reassert the relevance of their discipline to research and teaching. This horrified those teachers struggling to keep anatomy solidly in the business of training surgeons and away from the &#x0201c;dreamland&#x0201d; of speculation. Similarly, frozen sections were embraced by academic obstetricians and gynecologists who viewed anatomical research as a means of elevating their discipline, but alarmed those for whom tendentious arguments from pictures challenged the authority of clinical experience. For advocates, handling a corpse or examining a patient no longer sufficed to cultivate an authoritative understanding of the body. Opponents complained that frozen sections privileged ocular over digital expertise.<xref ref-type="other" id="P-640" rid="P-640"/></p><p>In Edinburgh&#x02019;s academic medical culture, anatomists and obstetricians who embraced frozen sectioning had a common concern with preserving the autonomy of their disciplines, especially from surgery, but used the technique in different ways. For anatomists, learning from frozen sections encouraged the full mental participation that would lead to a higher conception of bodily form and anatomy itself. They defined frozen sections as physical preparations necessary for helping students to cultivate three-dimensional knowledge of normal anatomical relations, and often made reconstructions from series. Anatomists presented the drawing, handling, and contemplation of these preparations as complementing dissection, creating the vivid and permanent &#x0201c;mental pictures&#x0201d; required for accurate diagnosis and surgery. Obstetricians likewise emphasized the tendency of dissection to mislead, but saw the advantage of frozen sections as providing more anatomically correct illustrations of difficult-to-obtain cadavers from which students could learn. Research on frozen sections highlighted the inadequacies of current teaching of female pelvic anatomy, and signaled that students needed more specialist instruction in obstetrics and gynecology.</p><p>By the early twentieth century, in part as anatomists and, to a lesser extent, obstetricians trained in Edinburgh took positions at medical schools across the anglophone world, the technique became common elsewhere, too.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f129">129</xref></sup> Frozen sections gained a surer foothold in teaching as part of a wholesale reevaluation of methods of medical instruction. Reformers encouraged schools to prioritize &#x0201c;inductive&#x0201d; learning, including by expanding opportunities for independent, practical, and often research-based study. In both anatomy and obstetrics, this brought a new appreciation of auxiliary aids, with X-ray and stereoscopic photographs, cinema films, living models, preparations, and frozen or formalin-hardened sections fixtures of practical demonstrations and self-directed learning in laboratories, teaching museums, and study rooms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f130">130</xref></sup> Anatomical <xref ref-type="other" id="P-641" rid="P-641"/> departments invested in &#x0201c;freezing apparatus&#x0201d; and even dedicated laboratories to produce frozen sections for teaching and research.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f131">131</xref></sup> Yet interest in frozen sectioning as a research technique faded in the 1910s, as the diminishing returns of gross anatomy drove advanced students toward the newer laboratory disciplines. Obstetricians recognized that innovation in their field relied increasingly upon bacteriology, experimental pharmacology, and biochemistry rather than anatomy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f132">132</xref></sup> Frozen sections continued to be used in undergraduate teaching, but their distinctiveness and appeal perhaps paled when compared to X-rays and as textbooks swelled with ever more various illustrations.</p><p>Sectional views of the body are routine in medicine today as clinicians and anatomy teachers exploit computers to visualize internal structures in both two dimensions and three. This has helped revive interest not only in nineteenth-century frozen sectioning as a precursor, but also in the section as a representational device across the sciences and in craft traditions such as architecture and engineering. Sections are claimed to have a unique capacity to convey relations among structures and spatial domains.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f133">133</xref></sup> The history of frozen sections suggests that we should focus less on their allegedly inherent qualities than on contexts of use. Frozen sections provoked controversy because, around 1900, anatomy and its relations with clinical disciplines were in flux. The arguments recapitulated earlier disputes over the roles of hand and eye in transferring medical knowledge and anticipated more recent ones over modalities of anatomical learning. As cryosections, X-rays, ultrasound, MRI, CT, and 3-D imaging controversially replace dissection in some medical schools, many anatomists still insist upon &#x0201c;hands-on&#x0201d; experience of cadavers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="f134">134</xref></sup> We should recognize the continuities of these debates, but also appreciate the contingencies that have shaped them.<xref ref-type="other" id="P-642" rid="P-642"/></p></sec></body><back><ack><p>I am grateful, for comments on earlier versions of this article, to Tatjana Buklijas, Christopher Lawrence, Malcolm Nicolson, Mike Sappol, J&#x000fc;rgen Schlumbohm, Jim Secord, Elizabeth Smith, Charissa Varma, and the anonymous reviewers of this journal.

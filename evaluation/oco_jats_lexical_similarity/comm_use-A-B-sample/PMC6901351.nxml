identified risks related to importing of laboratory vector snails and
schistosome strains from the Netherlands to Uganda; exposure to natural
infection in endemic settings concurrently with CHI-S studies, and unfamiliarity
of the community with the nature, risks and rationale for CHI. Mitigating
strategies are proposed. With careful implementation of the latter, we believe
that CHI-S can be implemented safely in Uganda. Our reflections are presented
here to promote feedback and discussion.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>Schistosoma mansoni</kwd><kwd>Controlled Human Infection Studies</kwd><kwd>Uganda</kwd><kwd>risk assessment</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="version-changes"><sec sec-type="version-changes" id="S1"><label>Revised</label><title>Amendments from Version 1</title><p id="P4">We would like to thank the reviewers for their insightful discussion and

people worldwide<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Infection is caused by
trematodes (flukes) of the genus <italic>Schistosoma.</italic> Because the infection
is responsible for considerable morbidity worldwide, particularly in Africa,
schistosomiasis was recently listed among the top 10 infections for which a vaccine
should urgently be developed<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>.</p><p id="P6">Controlled human infection (CHI) studies are an important tool for vaccine
development. They provide a platform to safely and swiftly test vaccine candidates
for the pathogen in question. Furthermore, they can contribute to understanding
host-pathogen interactions and help to unravel the nature of protective immunity.
They have been used successfully for a substantial number of infectious diseases,
including malaria, dengue, and influenza<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. A
CHI model has now been developed for schistosomiasis at Leiden University Medical
Center, where Dutch volunteers with no previous exposure to schistosomiasis
participated<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. However, the response to
schistosome infection, and to candidate vaccines, is likely to be different in
endemic countries. In such settings multiple differences in environmental exposures,
as well as prior exposure to schistosomes, drive differences in both the innate and
adaptive immune responses which determine infection susceptibility and vaccine
responses<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>.</p><p id="P7">We are therefore working towards the establishment of a controlled human
infection model for schistosomiasis in Uganda, where <italic>Schistosoma
mansoni</italic> is highly endemic. Almost 30% of the population is estimated to
be infected<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, with half the population at
risk<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. As a first step we held a
stakeholders&#x02019; meeting in Uganda in November 2017, and we published the
meeting report and resultant road-map for the implementation process<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. A key element of the road-map was to undertake a risk
assessment. This document therefore aims to provide an assessment of risks that may
arise before, during and after start of a controlled human infection model with
<italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> (CHI-S) in Uganda.</p><p id="P8">Male and female schistosomes live in the mesenteric or perivesical veins of
their human host, where they mate and produce eggs. These eggs are either released
into the environment through faeces and urine or stay within the host tissue where
they induce inflammation. When the excreted eggs reach fresh water, they hatch and
release miracidia that can then infect a suitable snail host. Infected snails are
able to shed larvae, called cercariae, which infect humans. The Leiden University
Medical Center (LUMC) CHI-S exposed healthy na&#x000ef;ve volunteers to increasing
doses of male cercariae to study the tolerability of such a controlled human
infection model. This male-only model avoids the risk of pathology caused by
schistosome eggs. To generate the infectious cercariae for a male-only CHI-S,
individual laboratory-reared freshwater snails are infected, each with a single
miracidium. Clonal replication follows, such that thousands of single-sex cercariae
are subsequently shed by the snail. The sex of the cercariae can be determined by
PCR, and the appropriate number of cercariae can be prepared for dermal infection.
Because snails shed thousands of cercariae over a period of weeks, every time they
are exposed to light, it is possible to first perform quality control (QC) testing
on every batch (e.g. to assess the viability, sex and bioburden of the cercariae).
Following principles set forward in good manufacturing practices (GMP) guidelines,
the cercariae and their excipients are produced and tested for consistent quality
according to predefined criteria. Only when compliant, is the cercariae batch
released for clinical use. To this date, 17 people have been exposed to <italic>S.
mansoni</italic> cercariae during CHI-S studies in Leiden.</p><p id="P9">In terms of the technical aspects of shipping infectious material to Uganda,
culturing the infectious material in Uganda and preparing the infectious cercariae,
we have considered three options. </p><p id="P10">
<bold>Option 1: Shipping of parasites and snails from the Netherlands to
Uganda.</bold> In this scenario, <italic>S. mansoni</italic> parasites and
snails would be shipped from Leiden (The Netherlands) for preparation of the
cercariae for human infection in Uganda. From a technical perspective, the easiest
approach to rapid implementation of CHI-S in Uganda would be to produce and release
the infectious snails in Leiden and subsequently ship them to Uganda. In Uganda, a
further snail shedding would be used to generate the infectious cercariae.
Alternatively, <italic>S. mansoni</italic> parasites (for example in the form of
<italic>S. mansoni</italic> eggs contained in a rodent liver) could be shipped
separately from uninfected snails, which would mitigate shipment risks.</p><p id="P11">The CHI-S model in Leiden uses a schistosome strain which has been genotyped
and has been mapped to be of Puerto Rican origin<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. Because this strain has been laboratory adapted and kept in the
Leiden facility since 1955, it has the advantage of its known virulence in animals,
experience of its effects in the Dutch human volunteers, and its sensitivity to
praziquantel. As well, the Leiden model uses <italic>Biomphalaria glabrata</italic>
snails which are not indigenous to Uganda (Appendix 1 [Extended data<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]). Therefore, the ecological risks of accidental
release of schistosomes or snails or into the environment have to be considered.</p><p id="P12">
<bold>Option 2: Shipping of parasites from The Netherlands followed by use of local
Ugandan snails.</bold> This scenario would involve transporting only <italic>S.
mansoni</italic> parasites (Puerto-Rican strain), then using local snail species
such as <italic>B. choanomphala</italic> (from Lake Victoria) or <italic>B.
stanleyi</italic> (from Lake Albert) to produce cercariae in Uganda<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. Advantages, as in option 1, would be the
fact that the parasite strain has been characterized in both animals and humans,
which decreases its potential risk for the volunteers. Disadvantages would be
possible technical hurdles to be overcome to establish a local snail colony and
achieve successful infection with release of infectious <italic>S. mansoni</italic>
cercariae. However, expertise in these processes already exists in Uganda<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, subject to laboratory renovations and staff
training to ensure compliance with GMP principles. This option would also be
relatively simple to implement.</p><p id="P13">
<bold>Option 3: Using local Ugandan parasites and local Ugandan snails.</bold> In
this scenario the full <italic>S. mansoni</italic> laboratory life cycle would be
established in Uganda, using a local snail species and starting with a new
<italic>S. mansoni</italic> strain, and a rodent mammalian host. Although the
risk of clinically unexpected, unwanted side effects, or of relative resistance to
praziquantel treatment, might be higher when using the local strain of <italic>S.
mansoni</italic>, the ecological risk would be lowest.</p><p id="P14">All options require preparation of the cercariae for human infection under
strict Quality Assurance and controlled conditions in Uganda with adherence to Good
Manufacturing Guidelines. In Leiden, procedures were developed based on GMP
principles contained in the European Commission directive 2003/94/ EC, with the
infectious cercariae considered as an &#x0201c;auxiliary medicinal product&#x0201d;.
Details of the procedures have been published<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. These include production in a biosafety level 3 facility, governed by
stringent standard operating procedures including for quality control, logging and
monitoring; production and counting of infectious cercariae by two independent
technologists; and antibiotic treatment and microbiological bioburden testing to
ensure that the cercarial product is free of pathogens with potential to harm CHI
volunteers. Equivalent procedures and quality control will be needed in Uganda in
order to implement CHI-S.</p><p id="P15">In this document we address risks associated with CHI-S in Uganda on three
different levels: i) the introduction of new species (the transport of snails, the
snail culture facilities, the potential for ecological harm as a result of importing
snails), ii) the introduction of a new schistosome strain into Uganda, and iii)
clinical trial risks common to all options (natural infection during the trial
period, and the risks to volunteers resulting from the controlled infection).</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Risk assessment methods</title><p id="P16">We identified risks and potential approaches to mitigation based on relevant
literature, experience from the Leiden CHI-S model, stakeholder discussions, and
discussion with experts. The level of risk and effectiveness of proposed controls
was determined by consensus between the authors. The inherent risk was defined as
the risk before putting controls in place, calculated as the product of the
likelihood and impact scores. The residual risk was similarly calculated, based on
likelihood and impact scores after controls have been put in place. Mitigating
controls could reduce the residual risk score by reducing the likelihood of an event
occurring, or by reducing the impact if it should occur. Likelihood was scored as
almost certain/common, 5; likely, 4; possible, 3; unlikely, 2; rare, 1. Impact was
scored as critical, 5; major, 4; moderate, 3; minor, 2; insignificant 1. Resulting
risk scores of 18&#x02013;25 were considered high, and unacceptable. Resulting risk
scores in the range of 9&#x02013;17 were considered moderate, with further controls
desirable if possible, and caution required if implemented at this risk level.
Resulting scores of 0&#x02013;8 were considered low, and usually acceptable.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Option 1: Shipping of parasites and snails from the Netherlands to Uganda</title><p id="P17">According to our first idea, infected snails would be shipped. The WHO
report &#x02018;Guidance on regulations for the Transport of Infectious Substances
2017&#x02013;2018&#x02019;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> provides
information on how to adequately transport infectious substances. In accordance with
these guidelines, shipment of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> infected snails falls
under &#x02018;CATEGORY B, INFECTIOUS SUBSTANCES&#x02019; (UN3373). Shipment of live
snails is a time-sensitive undertaking and therefore can only be facilitated by air
shipment. Infectious substances cannot be carried on as hand-luggage. Transport of
infectious substances are subjected to International Air Transport Association
(IATA) requirements. Packaging of Category B substances need to comply with rules
set out in the P650 packaging instruction<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>.
This involves triple packaging and proper marking and documentation. Upon arrival in
Uganda, it would be crucial for the package to clear customs as quickly as possible
so that snails arrive in good condition. In order to achieve this, the customs
office should be notified about the arrival of the shipment. In collaboration with
the customs officer, all required documentation should be prepared in advance and
approval for import of the products should be sought.</p><p id="P18">Alternatively, snails and <italic>Schistosoma</italic> parasites would be
shipped separately. Uninfected snails can be shipped more easily because this
shipment does not have to comply with the regulations for the transport of
infectious substances. Similar to the previous option, shipment should clear customs
as soon as possible. These snails could be kept to reproduce in the Ugandan
laboratory to sustain their life cycle.</p><p id="P19">A second shipment would contain <italic>Schistosoma</italic> parasites.
There are two ways in which this material can be transported (still under the
&#x02018;CATEGORY B, INFECTIOUS SUBSTANCES&#x02019; (UN3373)):</p><p id="P20">1) Within a living host such as a Schistosoma-infected hamster. These
animals can shed <italic>Schistosoma</italic> eggs that can be used to infect the
snails.</p><p id="P21">2) Within a preserved liver sample kept on medium from a
<italic>Schistosoma</italic>-infected hamster. This liver sample contains
<italic>Schistosoma</italic> eggs. Upon arrival in Uganda, further processing of
the sample provides miracidia which can be used to infect the snails. Test shipments
should be scheduled to determine the feasibility of such transports and the
conditions in which the liver sample should be shipped. From previous experiments in
Leiden, the preserved liver sample can be used to infect snails for up to one week
after being harvested.</p><p id="P22">Risks associated with shipping of parasites and snails from the Netherlands
to Uganda, and mitigating strategies, are summarized in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Option 1: snail culture facilities; potential ecological harm</title><p id="P24">To house the <italic>Biomphalaria glabrata</italic> snails in Uganda, they
would need to be kept in strict quarantine. <italic>B. glabrata</italic> are not a
naturally occurring snail host in Uganda, and should therefore not spread to the
environment. In order to house snails, an incubator, or room temperature, set and
monitored at 28&#x000b0;C is needed. The incubator (if used) door should be fully
closed when the laboratory is not in use. Precautionary measures to contain the
snails to the facility should be taken and include physical barriers, such as rooms
with closed doors and windows. The snail culture basins and water drainage system
should be covered with fine mesh to prevent escape (appendix 1 [Extended data<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]). In addition, access to the laboratory
should be controlled and restricted to the research team. The incubator (if used)
should preferably be positioned away from the door. Additional security measures
could be a double door to create a sluice. Appendix 2 (Extended data<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) lists precautionary measures that should to be taken
when working with schistosomes. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) will be
exchanged with LUMC and reviewed to fit the Ugandan facility. These SOPs deal with
culture processes as well as the disposal of infectious material.</p><p id="P25">In case a single snail would accidentally be released into the environment,
it is capable of reproducing in the absence of an opposite-sex snail using
self-insemination<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. This ability poses
an ecological hazard where a single snail could develop into a colony. In addition,
snails can be transported over large distances attached to birds and can survive dry
conditions for up to two months. This snail itself is not endemic in Uganda,
although previously this species has been held at the Vector Control Division of the
Ministry of Health for a different project. The consequences of accidental
introduction of this new species are difficult to predict, however it may result in
the following (Appendix 1 [Extended data<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]):</p><list list-type="simple" id="L1"><list-item><label>1)</label><p id="P26"> Interspecific hybridization between <italic>B. glabrata</italic>

local snail species for cercarial production</title><p id="P32">This approach only requires transport of <italic>S. mansoni</italic>
infectious material. This would use the second transport approach described in
option 1, within a preserved liver sample from a schistosomiasis-infected hamster.
The same regulatory guidelines for transporting infectious material apply. With
regard to Ugandan snail species, there is variability between snail species in
susceptibility to <italic>S. mansoni</italic> infection; however, there is
experience of conducting infection of local species at the Vector Control
Division<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, so this is expected to be
feasible. A major advantage of this approach is that the potential ecological and
genetic risks related to introduction of a non-endemic snail species can be
avoided.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Option 3: re-establishing the full <italic>S. mansoni</italic> laboratory life

strain</title><p id="P33">The alternative to shipping infectious material and snails from The
Netherlands is to re-establish the full laboratory life cycle of <italic>S.
mansoni</italic> using Ugandan snail species and Ugandan isolates of <italic>S.
mansoni</italic>. The life-cycle has been maintained in the past at the Vector
Control Division of the Ministry of Health, but is not currently available. The
advantages of using a Ugandan life cycle include reducing the environmental risk
associated with non-endemic snail species and schistosome strains. In addition, this
model would be most representative of the field infections in Uganda. Similar to
option 2, although susceptibility to <italic>S mansoni</italic> infection varies
between snail species, we do not expect this to be an issue, because the Vector
Control Division has experience in infecting local species. There are however
several challenges with using Ugandan snails and isolates. With regard to the new
schistosome laboratory strain, the characteristics of this would be unknown in terms
of virulence and susceptibility to praziquantel treatment. Determining these
characteristics would not be simple, since validated tests for schistosome
resistance are currently not available. In addition, the new isolate would not be
clonal and variability within the newly collected schistosome population might
result in variable responses in the host, and to drug treatment. An inbred Ugandan
strain could be achieved by crossing clonal males and clonal females to produce a
single F1 generation and subsequently cloning the offspring through snails followed
by another crossing. This procedure would need to be repeated several times to be
able to generate a reasonably monomorphic strain. This process would be laborious
and time-consuming and might also result in quite atypical parasites, not
necessarily representative of the Ugandan population of schistosomes in general.
Ugandan populations have been exposed to regular praziquantel treatment for over a
decade, so there is a risk that the initial isolates would include individuals with
relative praziquantel resistance<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and could
not be established with certainty in the initial stages of the above process.
Starting with a more diverse selection of cercariae would generate a more
representative laboratory population of Ugandan schistosomes, but would mean that
the characteristics of any particular clone (notably pathogenicity or praziquantel
resistance) selected for CHI-S would be unpredictable.</p><p id="P34">Options 1, 2 and 3 all require the establishment of facilities in Uganda for
production of the infectious cercariae under GMP principles, in order to ensure high
quality, reproducible infectious doses. Option 3 requires also the establishment of
suitable, specific pathogen free animal facilities to house the rodents (hamsters or
mice) that will provide the mammalian hosts in the laboratory life cycle. Risks
associated with these elements are also considered here (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Natural infection during trial period</title><p id="P36">The single-sex <italic>S. mansoni</italic> challenge has been designed to
prevent the occurrence of egg-associated morbidity. In the current model, volunteers
participating in the trial will be infected using only male cercariae which
penetrate the skin and result in patent infection. In future, a single-sex female
cercariae model may also be used to infect volunteers. The sex of the male cercariae
can be determined using a specifically designed multiplex real-time PCR which has
been described elsewhere<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. Once infected,
individuals should avoid any exposure to contaminated water. If a subject were to be
naturally infected over the course of the study, this might lead to mixed, male and
female, infections, with mating of the schistosomes resulting in egg production that
causes morbidity. If the Puerto Rican strain used in Leiden is imported for use in
Uganda, mating and (if adequate sanitation is not used) excretion of eggs into the
environment could alter the genetic make-up of Ugandan schistosome populations, with
unknown consequences. However, given the fact that the Puerto Rican strain has been
kept in rodents for &#x0003e;60 years, it seems likely that fitness in humans will be, if
anything, lower than Ugandan human strains. Moreover, given that the Puerto-Rican
strain is relatively inbred after prolonged passage in the laboratory, and was shown
to be praziquantel-sensitive in the CHI-S, hybridisation with Ugandan schistosome
populations is unlikely to result in increased praziquantel resistance or
virulence.</p><p id="P37">The chance of natural infection can be limited by choosing a study
population which does not come into contact with freshwater. However, this would
over-restrict recruitment from the true target population, which is people at risk
of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> infection. Options to minimise this risk among
volunteers from the preferred target population include the following:</p><list list-type="simple" id="L2"><list-item><label>1)</label><p id="P38"> The feasibility of avoiding fresh water may be surveyed using
questionnaires in a pilot study at the field site and the information used
to select volunteers least at risk of re-exposure, and to make provisions to
support volunteers to avoid re-exposure.</p></list-item><list-item><label>2)</label><p id="P39"> While selecting subjects, the investigator may ask whether the
subject is likely to spend time in, or to travel to, areas where the risk of
contracting a natural infection is high. If so, once again it should be
stressed that contact with fresh water should be avoided; volunteers
unlikely to achieve this would be excluded.</p></list-item><list-item><label>3)</label><p id="P40"> Apart from providing information to the volunteer and raising
awareness of this issue, frequent testing for eggs in stool and urine
samples may be performed by microscopy (and PCR). Eggs can be found
5&#x02013;7 weeks after mixed male and female infection<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. <italic>S. mansoni</italic> eggs in stool
would indicate a concomitant natural infection, which would necessitate
immediate treatment of the volunteer with praziquantel. However, stool
microscopy and PCR is likely to be unreliable given variable egg excretion
and the low sensitivity of stool examination for eggs<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>.</p></list-item><list-item><label>4)</label><p id="P41"> In those trials in which natural infection may be a considerable
risk, testing using plasma circulating anodic antigen (CAA) may be conducted
weekly from the outset of the trial. Both natural and experimental
infections may then be terminated as soon as patent infection has been
detected (e.g. at ~7 weeks post controlled human infection, when CAA levels
&#x0003e; 1pg/mL). Early abrogation of the infection will prevent mating and egg
laying. There would be modest drawbacks to the resulting data, because it
would not be possible to study the dynamics of antigen excretion over time
and quantitation of infection would be less accurate.</p></list-item><list-item><label>5)</label><p id="P42"> Alternatively, volunteers may be displaced to a non-endemic region
for the study duration. However, the prolonged, seven to 12-week
&#x0201c;admission&#x0201d; required for the CHI-S would be a major burden and
inconvenience, as opposed to the relatively short-duration (24 days) for
malaria CHI studies where such approach has been employed<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. The possibility of volunteers absconding
during the study, given the long duration, might be significant, abrogating
the value of such an approach. Additionally, this would have cost
implications, in terms of providing suitable accommodation and compensation
for loss of income.</p></list-item></list><p id="P43">Risks associated with natural infection during the CHI-S, and mitigating
strategies, are summarised in <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Risks to volunteers resulting from the controlled human infection</title><p id="P46">Controlled infection with <italic>S. mansoni</italic> has been successfully
performed in 17 Dutch volunteers. Although the single sex infection does not cause
egg-related morbidity in volunteers, it may cause symptoms in response to the
infection. These include dermatitis due to the percutaneous penetration of the
cercariae and an acute schistosomiasis as a consequence of a systemic
hypersensitivity response<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. Severe acute
schistosomiasis syndrome (Katayama fever) may present with symptoms such as fever,
fatigue, myalgia, malaise, non-productive cough, eosinophilia and patchy infiltrates
on chest radiography. In Leiden, several volunteers reported with systemic symptoms
which seemed to be an acute schistosomiasis syndrome, with one volunteer presenting
with prolonged symptoms of Katayama fever<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>.
In addition, one volunteer presented with peri-orbital oedema which lasted one day,
and may have been related to the infection<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>.
Such symptoms can be treated symptomatically and all recovered. Both these
volunteers had received the highest dose of cercariae (30 cercariae) used in Leiden.
The risk of severe symptoms can be minimised by dose escalation in modest
increments. The impact can be reduced by careful monitoring, provision of
symptomatic relief and abrogation of infection by treatment if necessary. Frequent
follow up visits need to be scheduled throughout the trial to discuss adverse events
and conduct clinical assessments of the study volunteers. Safety laboratory tests
need to be routinely performed. Volunteers can also experience side effects related
to the praziquantel treatment. Common side effects include nausea, dizziness, and
fatigue. Volunteers can be reassured that these symptoms are well recognised and
transient. Their severity can be reduced by taking praziquantel after food.
Symptomatic relief can be provided when required.</p><p id="P47">The 2017 stakeholders&#x02019; meeting identified community engagement to
ensure proper understanding of the CHI-S as an essential basis for ethical conduct
of a CHI study. CHI is a novel concept in Uganda, where CHI have not been undertaken
in the past and understanding of medical research, in general, is at a low level.
The idea of a &#x0201c;medical&#x0201d; procedure being undertaken which is expected
to cause symptoms, and undertaken for the greater, rather than an individual, good
needs careful explanation. Rumours and misunderstandings have the potential to
critically affect the work, and to have an adverse effect also on other
institutional research activities. Engagement with national and community leaders,
work with community advisory boards who can identify, and help to address,
misinformation; effective education of volunteers to a full understanding of the
expected effects of the CHI (and reasons for undertaking it) will all be essential
to the smooth and safe running of these projects. Experiences from the first malaria
CHI in Kenya give helpful guidance as to which issues are particularly relevant to
participants and may require careful explanation<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>.</p><p id="P48">Volunteers will receive remuneration for participating in the trial to
reimburse for expenses and compensate for time and burden of participation. Careful
consideration will need to be given to determine the exact amount of the
remuneration to avoid coercion. Recent remuneration guidelines from Malawi can help
to calculate the amount<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. In addition,
formative research is currently being undertaken to explore within the target
community what remuneration would be considered appropriate and acceptable.</p><p id="P49">Risks related to volunteers and communities during the CHI-S, and mitigating

establishing a controlled human infection model for schistosomiasis in Uganda. The
opinions expressed and risk scores allocated have been arrived at by discussion
between the authors and are therefore subjective. In submitting this document to
open peer review through the African Academy of Sciences Open Research Platform we
welcome discussion of these issues.</p><p id="P52">Based on the assessments made, our own reflections and proposed plans are as
follows.</p><p id="P53">First, we have decided not to pursue the option of importing <italic>B.
glabrata</italic> snails from the Netherlands to Uganda. Although the proposed
controls were estimated to reduce the risk or establishing a colony outside the
laboratory to low, it seems unnecessary to incur them. Since snail species endemic
to Uganda are susceptible to <italic>S. mansoni</italic> infection we expect that
option 2 will work. </p><p id="P54">Second, we propose to further pursue the option of using the Puerto Rican
laboratory strain of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> in the CHI-S in Uganda. We consider
that the recognised virulence and praziquantel susceptibility profile of this strain
makes it the safest option for CHI-S and have decided to have safety prevail over
the ecological risk. The long-term in-breeding of the laboratory strain is an asset
in this regard, making the characteristics of each clone of male cercariae
reasonably predictable, and the strain possibly less fit as compared to circulating
Ugandan strains. We also believe that the ecological risk of possible spread of the
Puerto Rican strain of Sm will be minimized with the proposed measures.</p><p id="P55">To generate infectious cercariae for human infection and challenge studies
following the principles of GMP it will be essential to establish a suitably
controlled snail facility in Uganda. For sustainability (to avoid the need of
repeated shipping of infectious material from the Netherlands) it will also be
necessary to establish a specific pathogen free animal facility to house the
mammalian host and complete the laboratory life cycle.</p><p id="P56">With regard to the selection of volunteers, and avoidance of natural
infection during the CHI-S, current activities include engagement with relevant
Ugandan communities which are potential settings for recruitment of volunteers. As
part of the engagement, options for avoidance are being explored. Our current view
is that careful volunteer selection, close follow up and immediate abrogation of
infection (on detection of CAA) will be preferable to 12-week
&#x0201c;admissions&#x0201d;; but views from the communities will influence our future
approach.</p><p id="P57">Controlled human infections with known pathogens inevitably involve risks
and possibly the burden of symptoms. Available mitigations in several examples
reduced our risk scores only to moderate, rather than low: for example, symptomatic
treatment and early abrogation of infection cannot reduce the likelihood of symptoms
below common, but can reduce the impact of the symptoms. Such areas emphasise the
need for caution &#x02013; for example, small group sizes and carefully monitored
dose-escalation approaches.</p><p id="P58">We realize that symptoms may be different among Ugandan volunteers than
among Dutch volunteers. Particularly, Katayama fever is considered less likely to
occur in subjects from endemic, compared to subjects from non-endemic settings<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Nevertheless, we shall provide full
information to potential volunteers about symptoms predicted from the literature,
and those which occurred previously in the Dutch volunteers. We are currently
piloting educational materials, volunteer information sheets, and tests of
comprehension in order to ensure that Ugandan volunteers can be enrolled with
genuine understanding and fully informed consent. As well, we shall work with
community leaders and advisors to ensure optimal understanding of the work, and to
mitigate the impact of rumours about the work which are likely to arise.</p><p id="P59">We conclude that, with careful risk management, CHI-S can be safely
implemented in Uganda with a view to accelerating vaccine development against this
important communicable disease.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>DisclaimerData availability</title><sec id="S12"><title>Underlying data</title><p id="P60">No data are associated with this article.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Extended data</title><p id="P61">Open Science Framework: Controlled Human Infection Model &#x02013;

<bold>We thank Dr Harn for his review.&#x000a0; Our response is as follows.</bold>
</p><p id="P85"> Comment. The authors produced a document that attempts to summarize the
risks associated with each scenario and how they would be reduced if proper
interventions were imposed. Overall, a nicely written paper that concludes that
&#x0201c;Option 2&#x0201d; introducing the Puerto Rican strain of Schistosoma
mansoni into Ugandan labs, and possibly the ecology, is the best way forward. I
disagree with this assessment as outlined here and feel that the more costly
(initially) &#x0201c;Option 3&#x0201d; is the best way forward to minimize unknown
potential ecological risks.</p><p id="P86"> Response. We agree that the choice between the safety concerns on the
one hand and the ecological risk on the other, is a challenging one. We also
understand from this comment that we have not been clear about why, on balance,
we prefer option 2. We have extended the paragraph in the discussion on this
decision to be more specific about why this is our current preference.</p><p id="P87"> Comment. A few things concern me. One, the authors state &#x0201c;The
level of risk and effectiveness of proposed controls was determined by consensus
between the authors.&#x0201d; Some of these authors were involved in establishing
CHI in Dutch volunteers in Leiden. However, I am concerned with the level of
expertise the authors have in ecology or ecologic modeling to accurately assess
the likelihood of introduction of new parasite or snail into the environment,
and the impact of such new species into the Ugandan environment?</p><p id="P88"> Response. We agree that we, the authors, have little experience in
assessment of ecological risks. For these parts of the risk assessment, we
therefore consulted relevant ecologists and geneticists including Dr A. J. de
Winter (Naturalis Biodiversity Center, Leiden, The Netherlands) regarding the
snails and Dr. M. Berriman (Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, UK) regarding the
parasite. To make this clear, we have better outlined the considerations. With
his permission, we have added Dr. Berriman to the acknowledgements.</p><p id="P89"> Comment. For Option 3 the authors state &#x0201c;There are however
several challenges with using Ugandan snails and isolates. With regard to
Ugandan snail species, there is variability between snail species in
susceptibility to S. mansoni infection;&#x0201d;&#x000a0; Wouldn&#x02019;t this
concern be the same for option 2.?</p><p id="P90"> Response. This is correct. We have adjusted accordingly and mention
this concern for option 2 as well.</p><p id="P91"> Comment. Also under Option 3, the authors state &#x0201c;With regard to
the new schistosome laboratory strain, the characteristics of this would be
unknown in terms of virulence and susceptibility to praziquantel treatment.
Determining these characteristics would not be simple, since validated tests for
schistosome resistance are currently not available. In addition, the new isolate
would not be clonal and variability within the newly collected schistosome
population might result in variable responses in the host, and to drug
treatment. In addition, dose-finding studies would start from scratch to find
the balance between tolerability and attack rate.&#x0201d;</p><p id="P92"> I find all of these arguments not justifiable. Determining
susceptibility to PZQ in their animal model is straightforward and they can do
this. They can easily produce a clone or clones of schistosomes to initiate
these studies. Yes, infectious dose studies will have to start from scratch, but
in reality, as this is an endemic population, not Dutch volunteers, this will
have to be done with Ugandans anyway.</p><p id="P93"> Response. We agree that an inbred population of Ugandan schistosomes
could be established in a rodent model, but are not confident that it would be
straightforward. Many generations of crossing following initial infection with a
clone of males and a clone of females would be required to produce a monomorphic
strain. Initiating the strain with a single clone of males and a single clone of
females would minimise variability, but might also result in quite atypical
parasites, not necessarily representative of the Ugandan population of
schistosomes in general.&#x000a0; Starting with a more diverse selection of
cercariae would generate a more representative laboratory population of Ugandan
schistosomes, but would mean that the characteristics of any particular clone
(notably pathogenicity or praziquantel resistance) selected for CHI-S would be
unpredictable. &#x000a0;</p><p id="P94"> Indeed our greatest concern is the potential for praziquantel
resistance. Ugandan populations have been exposed to regular praziquantel
treatment for over a decade, so there is a risk that the initial isolates would
include individuals with relative praziquantel resistance<sup>1</sup>&#x000a0;
which&#x000a0;could not be established with certainty in the initial stages of the
above process.&#x000a0; While we agree that some testing could be done in animals
the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of praziquantel are complex and
different between rodents and humans.<sup>2,3</sup>
</p><p id="P95"> With regards to the dose-finding study, we agree that this would be the
case for any of the three options and therefore removed this sentence.</p><p id="P96"> Comment. In the &#x0201c;Natural Infection during trial period&#x0201d;
the authors note that at some point they may introduce female cercariae
infections. Are they implying single-sex female cercariae infections? Later in
this section the authors note that infected individuals should avoid any contact
with schistosome contaminated water. How feasible is this? Much of the risk here
will depend on the residence of the cohorts for the Ugandan CHI trials. If the
volunteers are urban, with little to no chance of encountering contaminated
water, this point is moot and perhaps the authors have considered this as a
likely way to mitigate this potential problem.</p><p id="P97"> Response. We have clarified the sentence on female cercariae &#x02013;
we indeed plan on developing a single-sex female model in the future.</p><p id="P98"> With regard to avoiding contact with contaminated water, the location
we are considering to recruit volunteers for this work is a peri-urban fishing
village close to Entebbe, well known to the research team, where many communal
taps are available to provide an alternative water source. In addition, it will
be possible to select volunteers who have access to adequate sanitation. We thus
envision that it will be feasible to avoid any lake contact for these
inhabitants. Through surveys and group discussions, we are currently assessing
possible strategies to incentivise the use of tap water &#x02013; for example,
making it freely available for study participants. We hope that this will allow
participation from the true target population i.e. people with previous exposure
to <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic>.</p><p id="P99"> Comment. General, the Tables are informative. I may have missed this
but, it is not clear to me how the authors determined the reduced &#x0201c;Total
risk post control&#x0201d; score? We can see large swings in score from initial
&#x0201c;Total inherent risk&#x0201d; to the score for &#x0201c;Total risk post
control&#x0201d; but do not have a numerical rationale mentioned or discussed for
why this lower score.</p><p id="P100"> Response. The inherent risk was defined as the risk before putting
controls in place, calculated as the product of the likelihood and impact
scores. The residual risk was similarly calculated, based on likelihood and
impact scores after controls have been put in place. The difference in the
calculated scores is based on the degree to which the proposed controls are
expected to alter either the likelihood of the event happening, or the impact of
the event, should it happen. We have added the scores to the legend of the
tables for clarity.</p><p id="P101"> Comment. Potent should be patent</p><p id="P102"> Response. We have changed this.</p><p id="P103"> Comment. Hybridisation with local schistosome population unlikely to
result in praziquantel resistance? Maybe true, but you still have created a
hybrid parasite.</p><p id="P104"> Response. This is true. We have added a sentence to include this
concern.</p><p id="P105"> Comment. Under &#x0201c;Option 1: snail culture facilities, potential
ecological harm&#x0201d; page 5, first paragraph, line 4 should be corrected to
read &#x0201c;access to the laboratory should be controlled&#x02026;&#x0201d;</p><p id="P106"> Response. We have corrected this.</p><p id="P107">

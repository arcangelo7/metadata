the beauty and soul of curious researcher.</p><p>Leonardo Da Vinci affirmed that knowledge makes the soul younger and reduces the
bitterness of elderly age. So when we awake, despite all the problems of modern
society, we must reap wisdom and store softness for tomorrow.</p><p>The quest for knowledge is a source of joy it is the root of the findings and
inexhaustible source of progress.</p><p>Examples of exciting love of knowledge changed the history of humanity. Leonardo Da
Vinci was a proof of brain power for life. In addition to the master painter, he was
an architect, mechanic, engineer, chemist, botanist, geologist and also developed
several other activities. Maybe he was the first to study the human body dissecting
corpses, prohibited action at that time and now so important to the learning of
everybody of health area.</p><p>Surely science and technology have done wonders in many fields, but I agree that they
did not stimulate goodness. When we remember figures such as Da Vinci and the Dalai
Lama, we should take them as examples of great men who changed the world, because
they were great observers, its own characteristic of great scientists.</p><p>What we want represents what is best into universities, it is a time of great
curiosities, many questions, intense studies, inquiries and research and we can
immortalize youth through knowledge and make smooth each new day (our and
everybody's) to share the blessings of wisdom.</p><p>The great and immortal Pasteur has already stated: "Science and peace will triumph
over ignorance and war. People will understand themselves not to destroy but to
build." In ancient times it reflected a desire which still remains.</p><p>What is happening on the national scene is the existence of a defective medical
education with needy universities, creating new schools, when in fact, we should
think about removing some, because we cannot give them the least consistent
conditions with its superior design. The demerit is not private medicine, because we
still have illiteracy in Basic, Secondary and also in Degree education,
intercommunicating in his weakness because its lack of a solid foundation.</p><p>It is very serious that students traverse of faltering way these various stages and
come to the university, it should accept the brain of the nation. Must have a
demanding and selective teaching, no prejudice on creed, color, sex or
nationality.</p><p>Participating in enlightened meetings (politicians and others) that we hear proposals
that every student that conclude the high school could raise degree education
without entrance exam or defending the free profession without diplomas, another
barbarity that only weakens universities looking leveling down.</p><p>University teachings in health in Brazil were initiated by the French school, which
favored the patient as a whole. Today we see with rare exceptions it is a
mercantilist teaching, demagogic and electioneering often sponsored by the agencies
that should regulate medical practice.</p><p>For sure, what we all want, with USH (Unified Health System) or without USH, is a
social medicine of great magnitude, covering the entire Brazilian population,
preventive and curative medicine and that universities and university hospitals are
the source of knowledge based on education , research and extension focused on the
human individual.</p><p>"Where are the true sources of human dignity, freedom and democracy, but in the
infinite sense before which everybody are equal?" Questioned by Pasteur in his
prayer of thanks to Renan, who greeted him to join the French Academy. And the same
Renan said: "Life is a moment between two eternities, the one that precedes the
birth and that succeeds death".</p><p>Medicine and health are human activities toward humans. The clinical encounter is
their central point in the diagnosis, the rest is addition, nothing more than people
working tools taking care of people.</p><p>The increasing use of technology is welcome and signifies progress, but its use must
be done judiciously, targeting benefits without risk to patients and effectively
viable costs.</p><p>It discusses what should be modified or implemented first, finance, management, human
resources or health care model.</p><p>I see no possibility of separating these sectors: if there is no funding, no models
will implement, not improve efficiency and no human resources in quantity and
quality needed.</p><p>The model approach to ensure health should be reviewed. The induction ducts order
tests led people to demand the right such practices costly tests made by
experts.</p><p>On the other hand promoting and preventive practices in relation to disorders health
and sanitation policies should be prestigious, incorporate health professionals and
integrated with each other.</p><p>There is no possible to treat strokes (human suffering and higher expenses) when not
dedicate time and resources to the effective control of blood pressure. The same
should be in relation to vector-borne diseases caused by lack of sanitation.</p><p>Do not discuss a poor medicine, but a rationalization of the global focus on the
health of human, with simple steps that will have better and long-term effects on
citizens, society and the quality of life for all<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Some Facts to Ponder:</p><p>Federal Constitution - "Health is a right of everyone and a duty of the state" -
Brilliant!</p><p>How to make? Who pays?</p><p>The reality is that over 50% of people who go to consultation are not carrying any
organic disease; 50% of diseased, about half is sick because poor habits. In 90% of
cases, the conversation between doctors and the patient is able to establish a
diagnosis. Has anyone paid attention to the ad agencies that say "Health" and
offering most modern ambulances, helicopters, next-generation devices and stay in
ICU (Intensive Care Unit) for 365 days?</p><p>In public hospitals, large numbers of dependent patients of surgery to treat stomach
cancer and cholecystitis are operated only at an advanced stage of their disease
with obvious impacts on morbidity/mortality.</p><p>They found that the number of pharmacies in our neighborhood exceeds the real
needs?</p><p>So how about to face this health frenzy in the private field with the health neglect
in the public service?</p><p>"The state seriously injured and, stills, the Federal Constitution with impunity"
(Luiz Roberto Londres)</p><p>We are producing first world advertising and pushing the poor to a sanitary
underworld with consequent regression of health.</p><p>"The Education of a nation, according to what history teaches us, is one of the
greatest weapons for health. How much more health, culture and wisdom have a nation,
much more it will be happy" (Professor Mario Rigatto)</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Londres</surname><given-names>LR</given-names></name></person-group><source>Sintomas de uma &#x000e9;poca: quando o ser humano se torna um

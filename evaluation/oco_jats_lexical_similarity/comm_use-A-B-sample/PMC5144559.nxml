the pioneering work of Christian Barnard in this field<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. As impressive as the fact that this procedure was the
17<sup>th</sup> heart transplant done in the world, is that this surgery was
performed with a cardiopulmonary (CPB) machine made in Brazil.</p><p>At that time, the homegrown cardiac surgery was side by side with the cardiac surgery of
the developed world due to the capabilities of the bioengineering industry and the
remarkable surgical skills and dedication of the local pioneers<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. However, nowadays, there is an
industry stagnation with low technology incorporation in the country and a gap in this
field with the international technological development due to multiple factors. The
diminished number of publications by Brazilian authors - less than 0.9% of total
worldwide publications - registered in PubMed (US National Library of Medicine National
Institutes of Health) database ratify the scientific stagnation in the knowledge of
CPB.</p><p>Translational research, a "bench-to-bedside and beyond" approach, aims to improve
individual and public health by generating multicenter and multidisciplinary
collaboration to pull discoveries from basic science arising from laboratory, clinical,
or population studies into clinical applications<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p><sec><title>The importance of testing the devices used in our clinical practice</title><p>Recently, driven by the need of introducing translational research in CPB, the Heart
Institute of University of S&#x000e3;o Paulo (Instituto do
Cora&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o da Universidade de S&#x000e3;o Paulo) began
collaborative studies in pediatric CPB with the Penn State University Health Center
for Pediatric Cardiovascular Research.</p><p>Brazil has a large number of medical devices manufactured and available only in this
region that are approved by the National Health Surveillance Agency
(Ag&#x000ea;ncia Nacional de Vigil&#x000e2;ncia Sanit&#x000e1;ria - ANVISA)
without further clinical data or benchmarking with other similar devices. Moreover,
only FDA approved or widespread used products in the developed countries are object
of research by the international scientific community.</p><p>Monitoring pressure, blood and water temperature, use of bubble detectors and blood
level sensors devices are not incorporated neither in the clinical perfusion
guidelines, nor in the training school curriculum and clinical practice.
Furthermore, despite that some imported CPB machines equipped with all these safety
devices are available for use in a great number of cardiac centers, only less than
5% of them are used with the servo control mode turned on. In other words, the
majority of the clinical perfusions are conducted without any automatic safety
device control, thus making impossible to identify, explain and document undesirable
events. Building a stronger knowledge about CPB through basic research and clinical
trials, and the incorporation of the new information in the perfusion curriculum,
will help the management of children with congenital heart defects (CHD).</p><p>Altogether, a better understanding of the hemodynamics characteristics and
differences among these devices, as well the interaction between them and the
patients, will help to improve clinical outcomes in pediatric cardiovascular surgery
in Brazil and other Latin American countries using them.</p><p>The manuscript entitled "<italic>In-vitro</italic> evaluation of two types of
neonatal oxygenators in handling gaseous microemboli and maintaining optimal
hemodynamic stability during cardiopulmonary bypass", published as an original
article in this issue of the Brazilian Journal of Cardiovascular Surgery, represents
an important initiative of an international multicenter and multidisciplinary
collaboration. This study was conducted at the Pediatric Cardiovascular Research
Center at the Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, under the supervision and
mentorship of Prof. Akif Undar<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.
The purpose of this joint venture was to understand the characteristics of a
Brazilian oxygenator by using an internationally used oxygenator as a benchmark
rather than to determine the superiority of one of them.</p><p><overline><underline>READ ARTICLE ON PAGE 343</underline></overline></p><p>It is well known that only FDA approved devices are used in large clinical trials
published by the international scientific community. Thus, this study represents the
first published evaluation of the hemodynamics and handling capabilities of
microemboli in a Brazilian made oxygenator, using a FDA approved oxygenator as a
point of reference. Both oxygenators are clinically used for the same population and
although with different characteristics regarding maximum flow and prime volume,
they have a very similar hemodynamic performance. The undesirable passage of
microemboli from the venous side of the oxygenator to the patient is sometimes
forgotten, as well that the capability of capturing them by the oxygenator may be
different and dependent on the membrane area/maximum flow rate ratio.</p><p>Clinically, rather than the existence of microemboli in the arterial side of the
oxygenator, the most important issue is to diminish the passage of air to the
patient by placing an arterial filter in the circuit. Unfortunately, this practice
is not yet part of the routine.</p><p>I am aware that another study was done recently, in order to further understand the
role of an arterial filter - to be published soon - testing the Braile pediatric
oxygenator with and without an arterial filter in the CPB circuit, using another FDA
approved oxygenator as a benchmark.</p><p>The knowledge acquired with these and other experiments in CPB should enable the
authors and others to improve the outcomes for their CHD patients. They should be
congratulated for their initiative and efforts to embrace international parameters
in their clinical practice.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Leirner</surname><given-names>AA</given-names></name><name><surname>Puig</surname><given-names>LB</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Brazilian pioneers in artificial organs and heart

The known anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic actions of the active metabolite of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D [1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D] are mediated through binding to the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Here, we report on the unexpected finding that stable knockdown of VDR expression in the human breast and prostate cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and PC3, strongly induces cell apoptosis and inhibits cell proliferation <italic>in vitro.</italic> Implantation of these VDR knockdown cells into the mammary fat pad (MDA-MB-231), subcutaneously (PC3) or intra-tibially (both cell lines) in immune-incompetent nude mice resulted in reduced tumor growth associated with increased apoptosis and reduced cell proliferation compared with controls. These growth-retarding effects of VDR knockdown occur in the presence and absence of vitamin D and are independent of whether cells were grown in bone or soft tissues. Transcriptome analysis of VDR knockdown and non-target control cell lines demonstrated that loss of the VDR was associated with significant attenuation in the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway. In particular, cytoplasmic and nuclear &#x003b2;-catenin protein levels were reduced with a corresponding downregulation of downstream genes such as Axin2, Cyclin D1, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-8. Stabilization of &#x003b2;-catenin using the GSK-3&#x003b2; inhibitor BIO partly reversed the growth-retarding effects of VDR knockdown. Our results indicate that the unliganded VDR possesses hitherto unknown functions to promote breast and prostate cancer growth, which appear to be operational not only within but also outside the bone environment. These novel functions contrast with the known anti-proliferative nuclear actions of the liganded VDR and may represent targets for new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in breast and prostate cancer.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Breast and prostate cancers are among the most prevalent malignancies in industrialized countries. Although mortality has steadily declined over the past 20 years, a significant proportion of patients eventually develop metastatic disease, most frequently to the skeleton.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> Skeletal related events due to bone metastasis are frequent and a major cause of mortality and morbidity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup></p><p>We have previously shown in rodent models that reduced bone turnover inhibits, while increased bone turnover accelerates, breast and prostate cancer growth in bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4 bib5 bib6 bib7 bib8 bib9 bib10">4&#x02013;10</xref></sup> These experimental findings provide a logical explanation for the clinical observation that accelerated bone turnover is associated with higher rates of skeletal related events and poorer prognosis in patients with breast or prostate cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> They also offer a rationale for the use of anti-resorptive agents in these patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> We have further reported that in rodent models, vitamin D deficiency promotes the growth of breast and prostate cancer cells in bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> These effects appear to be mediated mainly through an increase in bone remodeling, that is, indirectly through changes in the bone microenvironment. However, inhibition of bone remodeling with potent anti-resorptive treatments (for example, osteoprotegerin, zoledronic acid) fails to completely reverse the pro-proliferative effects of vitamin D deficiency,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> suggesting that vitamin D deficiency may also promote cancer cell growth by an additional and possibly direct mechanism.</p><p>Apart from its function in calcium and phosphate homeostasis, vitamin D is known to exert strong anti-proliferative, pro-differentiation and pro-apoptotic actions in numerous cell types and tissues, including cancers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> The biologically active metabolite of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D [1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D], acts through binding to the vitamin D receptor (VDR), a member of the nuclear steroid hormone receptor superfamily. In the absence of vitamin D, the VDR remains in the cytoplasm. Ligand binding causes the VDR to form a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor, which facilitates movement of the VDR-ligand complex out of the cytoplasm and into the nucleus. Within the nucleus this complex binds to vitamin D-responsive elements in the regulatory region of target genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> In keeping with the classical function of vitamin D in regulating calcium and phosphate homeostasis, the VDR is expressed at high levels in tissues such as the intestine, bone and kidney.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> However, research into the pleiotropic actions of vitamin D has revealed that the VDR is also expressed in numerous other tissues, including malignant tumors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> Limited clinical studies in patients with breast and prostate cancer demonstrated that VDR expression in these tumors is negatively associated with tumor size and lymph node involvement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16 bib17 bib18">16&#x02013;18</xref></sup> Furthermore, mice with global VDR knock-out show increased sensitivity to carcinogen challenges.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> These and the findings of our previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> point to a broader role of the VDR in the regulation of cell growth, which may go beyond its classical function as a ligand-specific nuclear receptor. Using a VDR knockdown approach, the current <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies aimed to further define the role of the VDR in the regulation of breast and prostate cancer growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>The human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> was obtained from ATCC. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, JRH Biosciences, KS, USA) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. The human prostate cancer cell line, PC3, was obtained from ATCC. Cells were cultured in RPMI, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, Kansas, USA) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution. Unless otherwise stated, tissue culture media and supplements were from Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Knockdown of VDR expression in cancer cells</title><p>VDR expression was silenced in MDA-MB-231 and PC3 cells via a lentiviral-based expression system driving the production of short hairpin RNA species (shRNAs, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). The clones selected were VDR (referred as &#x0201c;VDR-KD&#x0201d;, transfected with shRNA, TRCN000019506, Sigma) and non-target control (referred as &#x0201c;NT&#x0201d;, transfected with non-target RNA, SHC002V, Sigma). VDR-KD and NT cells from both MDA-MB-231 and PC3 cells were selected using 2&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x000b7;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> puromycin (Sigma, USA) for two weeks. The cells resulting from this transfection will be referred to as MDA-NT, MDA-VDR-KD, PC3-NT, and PC3-VDR-KD.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell growth assays</title><p>NT and VDR-KD cells were treated with 10<sup>-8</sup>&#x02009;mol&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D<sub>3</sub> [1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>] or vehicle (0.1% ethanol) in medium supplemented with 2% charcoal stripped heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS). In our hands, untreated FBS contains 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D at a concentration of 360&#x02009;pmol&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> when measured by RIA (Diasorin, Stillwater, MN, USA). In contrast, 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D is undetectable in media supplemented with 2% charcoal stripped heat-inactivated FBS. We therefore consider culture media supplemented with 2% charcoal stripped heat-inactivated serum to be free of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D (&#x0201c;ligand-free media&#x0201d;). Cell growth assays were performed as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> Briefly, cells were seeded in media containing 2% charcoal stripped FBS and treated with either 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>&#x02009;mol&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> or vehicle. For the rescue experiments, cells were treated in the same manner with 1&#x02009;&#x003bc;mol&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> 6-bromoindirubin-3&#x02019;&#x02013;oxime (BIO, Sigma), a compound that binds to, and inactivates the enzyme that normally phosphorylates and degrades &#x003b2;-catenin (that is, GSK-3&#x003b2;). Addition of BIO to the cell culture inhibits this process and therefore stabilizes &#x003b2;-catenin signaling,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> allowing for &#x003b2;-catenin to translocate to the nucleus and maintain Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling in VDR-KD cells. Media were replaced every 24&#x02009;h and cells were counted daily by trypan blue exclusion until reaching 100% confluence on day four. Experiments were repeated three times in independent settings to ensure validity of the results.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell apoptosis assay</title><p>NT and VDR-KD cells were cultured in medium containing 2% charcoal stripped FBS and treated with either 0.1% ethanol or 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>&#x02009;mol&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> for 6 days as described above. For the rescue experiment, cells were treated with vehicle or 1&#x02009;&#x003bc;mol&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> BIO for 24&#x02009;h, allowing for stabilization of &#x003b2;-catenin in VDR-KD cells. Apoptosis was measured by TUNEL assay using an <italic>in situ</italic> cell death detection kit (POD, Roche Pharmaceutical, Manheim, Germany). TUNEL-positive and total cells were counted in 3-5 random fields/well at 400X magnification.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcriptome analysis and Quantitative RT-PCR</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from MDA-NT (<italic>n</italic>=3) and MDA-VDR-KD (<italic>n</italic>=3) cell cultures and was labeled and hybridized onto Affymetrix Human GeneChip Gene 2.1 ST arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions (Ramaciotti Centre for Genomics, University of New South Wales). Interrogating probes were imported and normalized using RMA algorithm and RMA background corrected. One-way ANOVA was carried out to extract significantly differentially expressed genes at unadjusted <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 level. Principle component analysis indicated that these cell lines had distinctive gene expression profiles (data not shown). Pathway enrichment analysis was then carried out on the top 150 differentially expressed genes to characterize and compare the biological pathways best represented in both cell types and affected by VDR-KD. The genes are ordered by their <italic>P-</italic>values and based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). These genes are compared to the database which consists of hundreds of carefully constructed, publicly available and curated pathway networks reflecting accumulated biological data from the field. Using Fisher&#x02019;s Exact test at <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01, these top 150 genes were embedded and compared within the network structure. Accordingly, under the null hypothesis, Fisher&#x02019;s Exact test was used to establish whether or not the candidate genes are associated with the pathway. The higher the enrichment score the more enriched the genes are within a specific pathway. This enabled us to infer a VDR-KD effect at the systems level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> and identify specifically which essential regulatory pathways are affected. To further validate the array data, cDNA was generated from the same RNA samples using Super Script III (Life Technologies). Expression levels of candidate genes were assessed by real-time RT&#x02013;PCR. Primer sequences are listed in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.

Whole cell lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer and cell fractions were prepared using NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA), supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Pharmaceutical). Protein concentrations were determined using a Pierce 660&#x02009;nm protein assay (Thermo Scientific), proteins were separated on Bolt 4%&#x02013;12% mini gels and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane by means of the iBlot2 rapid transfer (Life Technologies).</p><p>Membranes were blocked in TBS-T 5% skim milk for 1&#x02009;h, incubated overnight with primary antibody and then with secondary antibody for 1&#x02009;h.

Lytic bone areas within the tibiae were measured using interactive image analysis software (ImageJ, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA) and the size of osteolytic lesions was calculated.

This previously unrecognized function of the VDR is operational both within and outside the bone microenvironment. Mechanistically, we established that knockdown of the VDR in cancer cells interferes with the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway. Thus, VDR knockdown is associated with a robust reduction in cytoplasmic &#x003b2;-catenin protein levels, resulting in enhanced cell apoptosis and reduced proliferation rates. Of note, stabilization of &#x003b2;-catenin and hence re-activation of &#x003b2;-catenin signaling in VDR knockdown cells partly restored cell growth, mostly through inhibition of cell apoptosis.</p><p>We previously reported that vitamin D deficiency promotes the growth of human breast and prostate cancer cells in bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> This acceleration in cancer cell growth was, at least in part, attributable to the effects of vitamin D deficiency on the bone microenvironment, as hypovitaminosis D&#x02014;via an increase in parathyroid hormone secretion&#x02014;induces a significant increase in osteoclast-mediated bone resorption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> In addition, treatment with 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> inhibits breast and prostate cancer cell growth <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> This and the fact that inhibition of bone remodeling failed to completely reverse the pro-proliferative effects of vitamin D deficiency provided evidence that vitamin D signaling may be directly involved in the control of tumor growth in bone. Disrupting vitamin D signaling in cancer cells would therefore be expected to promote cell proliferation and tumor growth, similar to the effects of vitamin D deficiency.</p><p>However, contrary to this assumption and our expectations, we found that silencing of the VDR in breast and prostate cancer cell lines consistently resulted in reduced cell growth and increased apoptosis <italic>in vitro</italic>.

Taken together, our findings indirectly suggest that the VDR holds hitherto unknown functions that promote cancer cell growth independent of its ligand.</p><p>Most of the known biological effects of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D are mediated through binding to the VDR.

However we acknowledge that this conclusion cannot be seen as definitive due to incomplete VDR ablation. Our data indicate that the pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects of VDR knockdown are mediated through inhibition of the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway. Indeed, stabilizing &#x003b2;-catenin in VDR-KD cells partially restored the growth of these cancer cells. In this context, it was interesting to note that <italic>in vitro</italic>, BIO-induced stabilization of &#x003b2;-catenin reversed the effect of VDR-KD on cell apoptosis but not on cell proliferation (for example, Ki67, cyclin D1 expression). Also, compared to NT controls, the expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 mRNA was significantly reduced in breast cancer cells with disrupted VDR signaling. We have previously shown that IL-6 mediates direct paracrine&#x02013;autocrine signaling between cells of the osteoblast lineage and cancer cells, thereby enhancing the growth of breast cancers in bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> The reduced growth of VDR knockdown cells and tumors derived from such cells may, at least in part, be due to their diminished expression and secretion of interleukins like IL-6.</p><p>Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling plays a crucial role in breast and prostate cancer cell growth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26 bib27 bib28">26&#x02013;28</xref></sup> Aberrant activation of the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway in cancer cells is associated with the modification of pivotal processes such as Wnt expression, &#x003b2;-catenin stabilization or degradation, and nuclear translocation of &#x003b2;-catenin. In the nucleus, &#x003b2;-catenin complexes with T-cell factor and facilitates transcription of target genes activating cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. Currently, it remains to be seen how the VDR interacts with &#x003b2;-catenin in cancer cells. For example, we did not detect changes in GSK-3&#x003b2; protein levels, suggesting that the low &#x003b2;-catenin levels observed in VDR knockdown cells may not be due to its degradation. Instead, in cells with disrupted VDR signaling we found significant changes in the expression of genes upstream of &#x003b2;-catenin (for example, Wnt3a, FZD4), although it appears that these changes would not fully explain the profound reduction in &#x003b2;-catenin concentrations and signaling.</p><p>Clinical research into the role of vitamin D and VDR status in breast and prostate cancer has remained controversial. While it appears that the VDR is present in differentiated breast cancers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> the associations between VDR expression, its downstream signaling and patient prognosis or survival still require further clarification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> VDR expression levels may be associated with the transition from benign to invasive breast tumor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> Some studies showed cancer progression in breast tumors was characterized by reduced CYP27B1 and increased CYP24A1 expression, indicating that during the process of malignant transformation the reduction in VDR expression and higher CYP24A1 levels renders the tumor less sensitive to vitamin D.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></sup> Our results may help to explain some of the discrepancies between vitamin D status and clinical outcome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref></sup> as tumor behaviour and patient outcome may likely depend on both vitamin D and VDR status. Thus, in the case of vitamin D deficiency, cancer cells may lose the ligand-mediated nuclear signaling effects of the VDR and as a consequence, the unliganded VDR may become the dominant functional form. Hence, in a ligand-depleted context (that is, vitamin D deficiency), the unliganded VDR may be responsible for increased breast cancer cell growth. In the presence of adequate vitamin D, increased nuclear VDR localization and reduced unliganded VDR actions could together reduce breast cancer proliferation. It is possible that local production of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D, dependent on adequate serum 25(OH)D levels and tissue CYP27B1 activity, may be more important than levels of serum 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D which do not correlate closely with vitamin D status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref></sup> These possibilities need to be further investigated by measuring nuclear and unliganded VDR expression in human tumors at different stages of progression and correlating these results with the patient&#x02019;s vitamin D status in a prospective clinical trial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref></sup></p><p>In conclusion, the current study demonstrates that the unliganded VDR possesses intrinsic functions that control cancer cell growth in a ligand-independent manner through interference with the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway.

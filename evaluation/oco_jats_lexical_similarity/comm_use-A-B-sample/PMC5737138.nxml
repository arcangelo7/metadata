Yet, in spite of 25 years of research, there are still no such shuttles available. To this end, we have designed magnetic and gold nanoparticles (NP)-embedded silica nanoshuttles (MGNSs) with nanopores on their surface. Fluorescently labeled Doxorubicin (DOX), a cancer drug, was loaded in the MGNSs as a payload. DOX loaded MGNSs were encapsulated in heat and pH sensitive polymer P(NIPAM-co-MAA) to enable controlled release of the payload. Magnetically-guided transport of MGNSs was examined in: (a) a glass capillary tube to simulate their delivery via blood vessels; and (b) porous hydrogels to simulate their transport in composite human tissues, including bone, cartilage, tendon, muscles and blood&#x02013;brain barrier (BBB). The viscoelastic properties of hydrogels were examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Cellular uptake of DOX-loaded MGNSs and the subsequent pH and temperature-mediated release were demonstrated in differentiated human neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) as well as epithelial HeLa cells. The presence of embedded iron and gold NPs in silica shells and polymer-coating are supported by SEM and TEM. Fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy documented DOX loading in the MGNSs. Time-dependent transport of MGNSs guided by an external magnetic field was observed in both glass capillary tubes and in the porous hydrogel. AFM results affirmed that the stiffness of the hydrogels model the rigidity range from soft tissues to bone. pH and temperature-dependent drug release analysis showed stimuli responsive and gradual drug release. Cells&#x02019; viability MTT assays showed that MGNSs are non-toxic. The cell death from on-demand DOX release was observed in both neurons and epithelial cells even though the drug release efficiency was higher in neurons. Therefore, development of smart nanoshuttles have significant translational potential for controlled delivery of theranostics&#x02019; payloads and precisely guided transport in specified tissues and organs (for example, bone, cartilage, tendon, bone marrow, heart, lung, liver, kidney, and brain) for highly efficient personalized medicine applications.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The controlled delivery of active molecules in specific cells and tissue is highly challenging. It becomes more difficult to deliver drug and active biomolecules in highly vascularized and hierarchical structure such as bone and cartilages. However, the development of multifunctional integrated nanomaterials with magnetic, optical and electronic properties have opened new avenues in nanomedicine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1 bib2 bib3 bib4 bib5">1&#x02013;5</xref></sup> In bone tissue, nanomaterials can be used for drug and biomolecule delivery, tissue repair, and differentiation of stem cells to osteocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> Multifunctional nanostructures may deliver drugs and active components for bone tissue repair.

Gold NPs can be tuned to exhibit distinctive optical properties in near-infrared (NIR) region that allow photothermal therapy as well as localized imaging-based diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> Super paramagnetic properties of iron oxide NPs are suitable for magnetically targeted delivery of therapeutic molecules and holds significant potential for clinical applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup></p><p>We reasoned that a hollow nanoshuttle made of hybrid materials, such as silica, gold and iron oxide NPs with multimodality functions would have broad applications in personalized nanomedicine ranging from imaging to therapy. To this end, we integrated the gold and iron oxide NPs in the hollow silica golf balls (termed MGNS) as a next generation multifunctional delivery system. In order to control on-demand delivery by external physio-chemical stimuli, we enclosed MGNS in heat and pH sensitive polymer P(NIPAM-co-MAA) as a gatekeeper. To examine the effectiveness of P(NIPAM-co-MAA) coated MGNS for target on-demand payload delivery, we loaded Doxorubicin (DOX), a known cancer drug, in the MGNS using precipitation method. Further, we investigated the drug release in epithelial and neuronal cells&#x02014;the HeLa cells and differentiated human neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> The results of fluorescence imaging experiments showed a controlled DOX release as a function of pH and temperature. The transportation of MGNS was demonstrated in simulated capillary flow and in porous tissue models under external magnetic field using 5% polyacrylamide gel (PAG). Atomic force microscopy successfully showed the cellular uptake of MGNS and viscoelasticity of PAG in tested environment. The results of the studies delineate potential of MGNS for theranostics in bone, muscles, brain and other human tissues and organs.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>The aqueous suspension of carboxylated polystyrene microspheres of average size 0.2&#x02009;&#x003bc;m and 0.05&#x02009;&#x003bc;m and poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) were purchased from PolySciences, Inc, ammonium hydroxide (NH<sub>4</sub>OH), potassium carbonate (K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>), isopropyl alcohol (IPA), and ammonium carbonate were procured from Fisher Scientific, NJ, USA.

However, external magnetic field-guided delivery of MGNS/DOX/Magnet showed higher cytotoxicity than MGNS/DOX or free DOX. The reason is that the application of external magnetic field promotes MGNS mediated higher amount of DOX delivery into HeLa cells compared to DOX without MGNS. Further, we analyzed the effect of thermal stimuli on drug release and subsequent cytotoxicity. MGNS/DOX under heat treatment shows the highest cytotoxicity among all tested samples, potentially due to the heat-mediated accelerated release of the DOX.</p></sec><sec><title>Intracellular drug release in HeLa cells</title><p>We compared HeLa cell drug uptake between free DOX and MGNS/DOX drug delivery methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a and d</xref>).

However, when HeLa cells were exposed to the MGNS/DOX, only very weak red fluorescence was observed after 5&#x02009;min that gradually increased over 1&#x02009;h.

For the other three samples (with heat, with a magnet, with heat and magnet), the fluorescence intensity increased significantly at 60&#x02009;min compared with the 30&#x02009;min culture. After 90&#x02009;min of drug exposure, the cells without treatment appear to keep nearly the same fluorescence intensity while other three samples showed amplified fluorescence intensity due to the increase of the intracellular DOX concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>).

However, for the other three conditions, the MGNS-exposed NPCs showed the increase in the fluorescence intensity with the increased exposure time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Similar to the HeLa cells, the NPCs exposed to combined heat and magnetic field showed the highest fluorescence intensity. MGNS-exposed NPCs with the magnetic field and heat treatments showed much higher increase in fluorescence intensity compared to HeLa cells after 90&#x02009;min. In NPC experiments, a higher level of fluorescence intensity in the treated cells compared with the corresponding untreated (control) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>) was observed. After 15&#x02009;min of NPCs exposure to MGNS/DOX, the heat-treated sample and both heat- and magnetic field-treated samples already showed increased fluorescence intensity, while the only magnetic field-treated sample and untreated control samples showed no changes. We observed the rapid enhancement of fluorescence intensity for NPCs exposed to MGNS for 30&#x02009;min to 90&#x02009;min interval, while continuing incubation from 90&#x02009;min to 120&#x02009;min showed relatively slow increase in the fluorescence intensity of all the samples. At all examined experimental time points, comparisons of the cells cultured under three treatment regimens revealed that the heat-treated and dual stimuli-treated cells (cells&#x02019; subjected to both heat- and magnetic field-treatments) showed much higher fluorescence intensity than the cells treated with the magnetic field only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>AFM images of MGNS/DOX uptake in HeLa cells</title><p><italic>In vitro</italic> effect of MGNS/DOX on cellular morphology as a function of time was analyzed by AFM.

For this analysis, 5% polyacrylamide gel (PAG) was used. Mechanical properties of polyacrylamide hydrogel was analyzed by AFM using silicon nitride probe (DNP-10, Bruker) with a nominal spring constant of 0.06&#x02009;N&#x000b7;m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and tip radius of 20&#x02009;nm.

The MGNS design makes biomolecules smaller than the size of the pore suitable cargo for targeted theranostics&#x02019; applications. We demonstrate that external stimuli-responsive polymer P(MAA-co-NIPAM)-coating on MGNS acts as an efficient gatekeeper to prevent the spontaneous DOX release. This property of P(NIPAM-co-MAA) is the result of its temperature and pH sensitivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29 bib30 bib31 bib32">29&#x02013;32</xref></sup> At a temperature below the phase transition temperature (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub>=37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C), the polymer is in hydrogel state and stretched, and the pores on the MGNS are covered completely. In contrast, when the temperature raised above 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, the polymer becomes condensed and opens the pores. In acidic conditions, the DOX precipitate (DOX-NH<sub>3</sub>)HCO<sub>3</sub> decomposes, thereby allowing controlled DOX release. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, at temperatures below <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> low fluorescent readings are observed. This is because pores on the MGNS are fully covered by the P(NIPAM-co-MAA) polymer, and DOX remains in its precipitated state of (DOX-NH<sub>3</sub>)HCO<sub>3</sub> due to less solubility in aqueous solution. Increase of temperature is associated with increased fluorescent readings reflecting DOX release. Therefore, P(NIPAM-co-MAA) coated MGNS is shown to manifest thermo-responsive drug release.</p><p>Similarly, pores are also opened when the pH is decreased to acidic conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> Higher DOX release at acidic pH is due to pH sensitivity of the MAA moiety in P(NIPAM-co-MAA) polymer; the polymer changes from hydrophilic to hydrophobic state with decrease in pH. There is little or no DOX released in neutral pH conditions because the polymer exhibits an extended hydrophilic state that covers MGNS pores. In contrast, at acidic pH, the polymer changes to a hydrophobic state and was contracted, thus opening the pores resulting in higher fluorescent signals in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>. Dual stimuli-triggered drug release profiles demonstrate dynamics potentially relevant to complex physiological conditions <italic>in vivo</italic>. At the sites of inflammations and in solid tumor tissues across all organs and structures including brain, heart, lung and bone, typically characterized by acidic pH, the polymer-coated nanoshuttles would respond by polymer condensation following the temperature increase, causing pore opening and drug release. Additionally, MTT assay results show that MGNS have good cyto-compatibility, indicating that subsequent decrease in cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>) are due to the presence of the released drug, DOX, in response to combined effect of external stimuli (heat, pH, and external magnetic field).</p><p>We have reported previously that MGNS/DOX drug delivery system showed lysosome-mediated fast release of a drug due to lower pH (that is, 5) in lysosomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> Here we showed that MGNS/DOX could potentially deliver and maintain a high concentration of DOX in HeLa and in differentiated neural cells. From analysis of fluorescence intensity profiles HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a and d</xref>) and NPC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a and b</xref>), the effect of thermal stimuli and magnetic field on the intracellular DOX release is evident in both the cells. It was evident that dual stimuli (thermal/pH and magnetic field) further enhanced the release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This suggests that combining the responsiveness to two stimuli should increase the therapeutic effect due to enhanced drug release. More importantly, results demonstrated that MGNS nanoshuttles could potentially deliver and release much more drugs selectively at tumor sites. Application of the magnetic field localized MGNS in the cells and enhanced the MGNS/DOX entry inside cells while increased temperature increased local temperature due to presence of gold and iron oxide and enhanced the release. This conclusion is supported with AFM data that show that MGNS readily enter HeLa cells and the number of particles inside the cell increased with time. Consequently, the cell morphology changed to irregular shape after 120&#x02009;min of exposure to the DOX-loaded nanoparticles. Intracellular uptake experiments with NPC indicated that the NPCs exposed to the DOX-loaded MGNS appear more sensitive to the external stimuli than HeLa cells. This is consistent with AFM images that show higher uptake of MGNS in NPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6j</xref>) than in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). All the AFM images demonstrate that the MGNS could readily enter the neural cells and the magnet was instrumental in localizing nanoshuttles in the cell.</p><p>Targeted delivery of drug molecules in bone tissue, which is a suitable microenvironment for cancerous cell growth and destination for metastatic cells, is a major challenge. Since MGNS nanoshuttles have the ability to be magnetically guided to a target region, their transport behavior becomes important to study in different environment such as flowing liquid and porous composite materials.. As the bone is a composite material, the stiffness varies dramatically among various sub-structures.

MGNS travel slowly and in clusters in dense gel such as PAG, indicating that they are capable of being directed to a target site, for example, in porous bone tissue. Polymer-coated MGNS travel faster in fluid environments, although in larger clusters. This property could be exploited for intravenous delivery of payload through blood to target areas such as the bone marrow.</p><p>Preclinical development of theranostics using our Nanoshuttles, that have potentially broad practical applications, would accelerate implementation in clinical practice of the evidence-based next generation nanomedicine for all tissues and organs, including bone. Specifically, there are several significant promises, including targeted magnetic guidance based on-demand retention at defined anatomic locations of bones. This feature is particularly important for specific hard-to-reach anatomic locations in human body such as internal linings of the skull, other parts of the skeleton, surfaces of bone cavities, and bone marrow. Targeted magnetic guidance will enable passage from blood through biological barriers such as blood&#x02013;brain barrier and/or blood-solid tissues barriers. Moreover, intrinsically embedded features enable the real-time imaging of tissues and this feature is particularly important to extend the potential utility of this technology from delivery to theranostic application.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Magnetic and gold nanoparticles embedded nanoshuttle was designed and used as a drug carrier in human cells to demonstrate its uptake and controlled release of the payload. We loaded DOX inside the MGNS using the precipitation method and utilized thermal/pH bi-sensitive polymer P(NIPAM-co-MAA) as a gatekeeper to nanopores. Fluorescence signal shows significantly high loading efficiency of DOX as well as pH and temperature controlled release. <italic>In vitro,</italic> drug release experiments in HeLa cells and neurons indicated that we could effectively control the DOX release inside the cells by applying heat and magnetic field. MGNS/DOX can be concentrated and retained inside human cells, and DOX can be released in a controlled manner with high efficiency. Human neurons (ie, NPCs) showed more responsiveness to the control external stimuli compared with the HeLa cells. These differential drug release responses of MGNS in HeLa cells and NPCs show a promise for the design of cell specific controlled drug release systems. Moreover, a use of the magnetic field to pull MGNS holds a great potential for tissue specific (eg, bone, heart, lung, and brain) clinical applications in targeted drug delivery and on-demand drug release.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors acknowledge and appreciate Abhijith G Karkisaval, for providing a schematic diagram, Shyni Varghese and Yuze Zheng for providing hydrogels.

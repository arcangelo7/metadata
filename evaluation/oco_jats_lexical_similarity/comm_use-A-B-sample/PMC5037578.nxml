We have applied the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) approach to quantify load-induced fluid and solute transport in the LCS <italic>in situ</italic>, but the measurements were limited to cortical regions 30&#x02013;50&#x02009;&#x003bc;m underneath the periosteum due to the constrains of laser penetration. With this work, we aimed to expand our understanding of load-induced fluid and solute transport in both trabecular and cortical bone using a multiscaled image-based finite element analysis (FEA) approach. An intact murine tibia was first re-constructed from microCT images into a three-dimensional (3D) linear elastic FEA model, and the matrix deformations at various locations were calculated under axial loading. A segment of the above 3D model was then imported to the biphasic poroelasticity analysis platform (FEBio) to predict load-induced fluid pressure fields, and interstitial solute/fluid flows through LCS in both cortical and trabecular regions. Further, secondary flow effects such as the shear stress and/or drag force acting on osteocytes, the presumed mechano-sensors in bone, were derived using the previously developed ultrastructural model of Brinkman flow in the canaliculi. The material properties assumed in the FEA models were validated against previously obtained strain and FRAP transport data measured on the cortical cortex. Our results demonstrated the feasibility of this computational approach in estimating the fluid flux in the LCS and the cellular stimulation forces (shear and drag forces) for osteocytes in any cortical and trabecular bone locations, allowing further studies of how the activation of osteocytes correlates with <italic>in vivo</italic> functional bone formation. The study provides a promising platform to reveal potential cellular mechanisms underlying the anabolic power of exercises and physical activities in treating patients with skeletal deficiencies.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>It is well known that bone tissue is capable of adapting its mass and structure in response to mechanical cues.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>
</sup> Although the cellular and molecular mechanisms of how the mechanical environment affects bone tissue are still not well understood, various mechanical parameters including (but not limited to) matrix deformations (strains), interstitial fluid pressure, and fluid flow-induced shear and drag forces have been found to impact bone&#x02019;s responses to mechanical loading at cellular and tissue levels.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>
</sup> Quantification of the strains associated with physiological mechanical stimuli in bone has been performed at both tissue and cellular levels.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3 bib4 bib5">3&#x02013;5</xref>
</sup> Using strain gages, the tissue-level strains were found to vary from ~600&#x02009;&#x003bc;&#x00190; during the light activity of walking to ~2&#x02009;000&#x02009;&#x003bc;&#x00190; during vigorous activities such as running and jumping.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>
</sup> Strains at the cellular levels have been mapped recently using finite element analysis (FEA) or imaging correlation techniques, and inhomogeneous strains (0.8%&#x02013;3%) were recorded near the lacunar pores.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>
</sup> Whether these matrix strains directly excite osteocytes, the presumed mechanical sensors in bone remain debatable. Previous experiments have shown that bone cells were more sensitive to loading-induced fluid flow than matrix strains.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>
</sup> Recent studies strongly suggest that osteocytes, due to their large number and strategic positioning in the bone matrix, have very important roles in bone adaptation and metabolism.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8 bib9 bib10">8&#x02013;10</xref>
</sup> These multi-functioning cells form an extensive and well-connected network that optimizes them for detecting external mechanical stimuli, for example, fluid flow in the canaliculi driven by load-induced matrix deformations. In response, osteocytes release various soluble bioactive factors, which modulate the functions of other bone cells and trigger biological processes such as osteoclastic resorption during overuse and disuse as well as load-induced osteoblastic bone formation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11 bib12 bib13">11&#x02013;13</xref>
</sup> The microscopic lacunar&#x02013;canalicular system (LCS) that houses the osteocytes within the mineralized matrix is one key feature that enables the osteocytes to perform these important functions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>
</sup> Not only does the LCS provide the critical &#x0201c;life line&#x0201d; for nutrient supply and &#x0201c;network&#x0201d; for cell signaling<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14 bib15 bib16">14&#x02013;16</xref>
</sup> but it also possesses the structural components (for example, tethering fibers within the fluid annulus) to amplify the loading signals and convert the overall loading to cellular stimulation forces such as shear stress and/or drag force acting on the osteocytes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>
</sup>
</p><p>We and others have built mathematical models to predict the magnitudes of load-induced fluid flow and solute transport in the LCS<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19 bib20 bib21 bib22 bib23 bib24 bib25 bib26">19&#x02013;26</xref>
</sup> based on the groundbreaking paper by Weinbaum <italic>et al.</italic>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>
</sup> A mathematical model was developed to investigate the net solute (for example, nutrients and tracers) transport in the discrete LCS channels during cyclic loading of bone, and solute mixing within the extracellular space in lacunae was found to be responsible for the net solute transport.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>
</sup> To guide the experimental investigation of solute convections using the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) approach that was developed initially for diffusion studies,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>
</sup> Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>
</sup> developed a one-dimensional, three-compartment model to simulate load-induced solute transport in the LCS during FRAP experiments. This modeling work enabled the use of experimental FRAP measurements at the lacunar level to predict fluid flow in the canalicular level in a later study.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>
</sup> We further expanded the three-compartment model by considering the solute&#x02013;matrix interaction as exogenous tracer probes moved through the osteocytic pericellular matrix,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>
</sup> allowing us for the first time to quantify the average fiber spacing in bones from young and aged mice with normal or altered pericellular matrix conditions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>
</sup> However, due to limited laser penetration into mineralized bone tissue, FRAP measurements have been limited only to the cortical bone 30&#x02013;50&#x02009;&#x003bc;m underneath the periosteum of the tibial cortex.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27 bib28 bib29">27&#x02013;29</xref>
</sup> Currently, transport measurements on deeper cortex and trabecular bone areas are lacking. These locations are of biological significance because they typically undergo changes under mechanical loading or disuse conditions.<sup>

</p><p>FEA is a powerful numerical tool of analyzing stress&#x02013;strain fields in objects of irregular shapes and has been extensively used in bone research. A multilevel FEA model of a human femur cortex was developed to predict local matrix deformations at the osteocyte level during normal gait.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>
</sup> To predict interstitial fluid flow in bone, a two-dimensional FEA poroelasticity model was developed to investigate the load-induced fluid flow in cortical bone.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>
</sup> In another study, solute/fluid flow fields were predicted in an FEA model of a rat tibia under four-point bending.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>
</sup> All of these models have focused on cortical bone sites. In this study, we aimed to develop a multiscale approach combining FEA and ultrastructural modeling. Our objective was to test the feasibility of the multiscale approach to predict functional outcomes resulted from mechanical loading. These outcomes include macroscopic (whole-bone level) and microscopic (LCS level) distribution fields of matrix strains, interstitial fluid pressure, as well as stimulation (fluid shearing and drag forces) at the cellular level. The rich pool of experimental data that we have obtained using FRAP on cortical bone<sup>

This greatly improved the fidelity of our model predictions on deeper cortex and trabecular bone regions, which are inaccessible with current FRAP techniques.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Whole-bone model</title><p>An intact mouse tibia from an adult C57BL/6J male mouse was imaged by a Scanco &#x003bc;CT35 scanner (Scanco USA, Inc., Wayne, PA, USA) using a standard protocol (55&#x02009;keV, 145&#x02009;&#x003bc;A, 200&#x02009;ms integration time, 3&#x02009;600 projections, and 20&#x02009;&#x003bc;m voxel size). The raw image slices (998 slices) were imported in the DICOM format into ScanIP (Simpleware, Chantilly, VA, USA), with which the entire tibia, including the cortical and trabecular bone, was thresholded and meshed with 5&#x02009;112&#x02009;690 tetra elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

The average strain of a 1&#x000d7;3&#x02009;mm area on the medial&#x02013;anterior surface that was 20%&#x02013;40% distal from the tibial proximal end was compared with the strain measurement of a similar area in our previous studies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>

These intertwined pores make direct measurements of bone permeability quite challenging. The reported permeability varied from 10<sup>&#x02212;12</sup> to 10<sup>&#x02212;23</sup>&#x02009;m<sup>2</sup>, depending on the levels of pores probed.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>
</sup> Because the murine cortex is relatively thin with pores being predominantly smaller LCS ones, the permeability at the tissue (element) level was chosen to be in the lower range of the reported values associated with the smaller pores. In the model, the permeability was varied parametrically over three orders of magnitude (2.8&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;20</sup>, 2.8&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;21</sup>, or 2.8&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;22</sup>&#x02009;m<sup>2</sup>). The permeability was assumed to be isotropic and identical at both trabecular and cortical bones. Solute diffusivity was assumed to be isotropic for small strain cases as in loaded tibia.<sup>

Large variations of LCS porosity (1%&#x02013;22%) were reported in literature using either two-dimensional or 3D imaging techniques.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>
</sup> We thus measured the volume fractions of lacuna and canaliculi in the murine cortical bone using <italic>in situ</italic> confocal microscopy and a protocol modified from a previous study.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>
</sup> In brief, femoral mid-shafts were dissected and sectioned into 0.3&#x02009;mm-thick segments, fixed in 10% formaldehyde for 24&#x02009;h, polished to 0.05&#x02013;0.10&#x02009;mm thickness, dehydrated in ascending grades of ethanol, stained in sodium fluorescein solution for 4&#x02009;h, and mounted on an imaging chamber with a bottom cover glass. High-resolution 3D stacks (122 slices) of a field of 512&#x000d7;256 pixels (pixel 0.199&#x02009;&#x003bc;m; <italic>z</italic>-step=0.2&#x02009;&#x003bc;m), which contained several lacunae and numerous canaliculi, were captured using a 60&#x000d7; oil objective and a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, LLC, Peabody, MA, USA). The raw images were then imported to the Volocity software package (PerkinElmer, Tempe, AZ, USA), where an adaptive threshold and a size-dependent segmentation scheme were applied sequentially to separate the larger lacunae from the smaller canaliculi. The surface area of the lacunae and the total volume of the canaliculi was then obtained. Unlike previous measurements, we quantified the volume fraction of the LCS pores by subtracting the cell body volume. Our previous transmission electron microscopy studies showed that within the lacunae there was a 0.49&#x000b1;0.15&#x02009;&#x003bc;m gap between the lacunar matrix wall and the cell body, and that the pericellular fluid space occupied 79% of the total canalicular cross-sectional area.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>
</sup> These measures were used to calculate the volume fractions of the lacunar pores and the canalicular pores, respectively. The lacunar pore volume was the product of the total lacunar surface area and the lacunar gap. The total canalicular pore volume was a fraction (79%) of the total measured canalicular volume. Our result (shown later in the Results section) demonstrated a total lacunar and canalicular porosity (15.4%) in mouse, where the majority was contributed by canaliculi (87.5%). This value was adopted for all the simulations shown below. Please note that this value may represent an overestimation of the LCS porosity due to potential artifacts such as the partial volume effect and axial distortion associated with light microscopy.<sup>

Quantifying the mechanical stimulation, however, remains a challenge, because of the complex structure and inhomogeneous material properties of the bone tissue<sup>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>
</sup> With the advances of imaging techniques, we are now able to reconstruct the 3D structures of bones with sufficient details from the whole-bone level (on the order of 0.1&#x02013;1&#x02009;m), individual osteon/trabecula level (on the order of 0.2&#x02009;mm), and down to the cellular level (on the order of 0.01&#x02009;mm).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>
</sup> One striking feature of the bone tissue is the multiscaled, interconnected pore system housing the cellular components in bone, spanning the central marrow cavity, vascular channels, and the LCS.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>
</sup> These pores are saturated with interstitial fluid, providing a continuous pathway for nutrient supply, waste removal, and exchange of signaling molecules. Furthermore, when bone is subjected to mechanical strains during exercise, it behaves as a stiff sponge: pore pressure builds up and fluid is forced to flow within the bone matrix through the pores.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>
</sup> The osteocytes residing in the bone thus experience matrix deformation, fluid pore pressure, fluid shear force, as well as fluid drag force due to the pericellular tethering fibers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>
</sup> These mechanical parameters have been quantified using various engineering techniques. Matrix deformations have been measured with strain gages and imaging correlation methods.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>
</sup> FRAP-based imaging techniques in combination with mathematical models provide measures of fluid and solute flows at the canalicular level under loading,<sup>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>
</sup> These data greatly enhance our understanding of the mechanosensing and mechanotransduction processes in bone that underlie the anabolic power of physical activities.

The objective of this study was to expand the mapping of mechanical stimulations to the inner portions of the bone in a multiscale manner.</p><p>This study demonstrated the feasibility of performing such comprehensive mapping using an image-based FEA platform. This approach is consisted of three coupled models at the whole bone, bone segment, and single canaliculus levels. Comparing with previous models,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19 bib20 bib21 bib22 bib23 bib24 bib25 bib26">19&#x02013;26</xref>

The model is physically sound, where the segment model is coupled with the whole-bone level through load-induced displacement fields, and the intrinsic LCS pores couple the segment model with the single canaliculus model. We also took advantage the available experimental data (on cortical bone) to extensively validate the model. The optically measured strain data<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>

Using the validated models, we showed that loading-induced cellular stimulations such as pore pressure, fluid flow-induced shear stress and/or drag force acting on osteocytes could be mapped at both cortical and trabecular sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These quantitative data would help us to better understand which loading-induced parameters, including but not limited to matrix deformation, pore pressure, fluid shear, and fluid drag, correlate well with the spatial distribution of <italic>in vivo</italic> bone formation.</p><p>As with any model, our model has its limitations and assumptions. (1) The FE model was generated from a single biological sample, limiting the adoption of statistical analysis. As the goal of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of modeling bone fluid flow, this simplified approach was chosen to remove any potential variabilities from the bone geometry and thus allow the study to better focus on validating model parameters and coupling schemes. With the procedure being streamlined and computational power ever increasing, the methodologies described herein can be applied for multiple samples to account for variations on bone anatomy. (2) The scaling factor between tissue-level fluid flow and the canalicular-level fluid flux was assumed to depend on the LCS porosity (15.4%), which was measured using confocal imaging. As noted earlier, this value may be an overestimation due to the scattering of fluorescence signals and axial stretching in the point spread function.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>
</sup> Indeed, smaller porosity values (1%&#x02013;5%) have been reported using methods based on electron microscopy and x-ray computation topography.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>
</sup> Were the LCS assumed to be 1.5%, the model outputs (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) would be expected to be nearly one order of magnitude higher. (3) The permeability we used in the model (2.8&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;20</sup>&#x02009;m<sup>2</sup>) was based on our experimental measurement in dog bone.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>
</sup> Large variations (in several orders of magnitude) of permeability have been reported in the literature.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>
</sup> We also tested the sensitivity of the model outputs to permeability. As the permeability was reduced for one or two orders of magnitude (2.8&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;21</sup> and 2.8&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;22</sup>&#x02009;m<sup>2</sup>), fluid flow velocity was found to decrease compared with the values presented here (that is, 22% and 0.25% for locations A&#x02013;C, and 69% and 15% for locations D&#x02013;F, respectively). We thus conclude that accurate permeability measurement is the key to predict fluid flow velocity in the model. (4) We assumed sealed boundaries in our segment model for faster convergence in solute concentration simulations. This idealized condition was not fully compatible with <italic>in vivo</italic> situation where periosteum was found to be permeable for fluid and small solute.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>
</sup> Leaky permeability should be considered for future modeling. (5) We assumed a biphasic material with isotropic linear elastic solid phase, which has constant isotropic permeability and constant isotropic solute diffusion coefficients. Previous studies<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>
</sup> indicated that the anisotropy of bone has an important role in the occurrence and distribution of the fluid flow in bone, which should be quantified in future experimental and modeling studies. Despite these limitations, our model was demonstrated to serve as a promising platform that would allow in-depth studies of local loading environment, which may help identify the important mechanical factors that drive bone&#x02019;s response to loading and disuse in normal and disease conditions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The study was supported by grants from NIH (P30GM103333 and RO1AR054385 to LW), a China CSC fellowship (to LF), and DOD W81XWH-13-1-0148 (to XLL).</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="bib1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">

aneurysm repair, the benefits of this abdominal aortic aneurysm type of
surgical management are justfied by minor recovery time and hospitalization,
as well as an option for patients not elected to conventional open repair.
In this minimally invasive surgical aproach, time of procedure and radiation
doses can be substantial - and the increasing frequency of these procedures
and it's complexity have impelled vascular surgeons to face additional and
successive risk to occupational radiation exposure. Meticulous study of the
computed tomography angiography during the endovascular aneurysm repair
preparation allows reduction of unnecessary radiation exposure, as also
reduces consecutive image acquisition and contrast use (that may be related
to renal overload in susceptible patients). Some studies have proposed
strategies to optimize endovascular intervention to reduce contrast use and
X-ray exposure. Although they might prove to be effective, they rely on use
of additional specific and advanced equipment, available only in major
centers. As an alternative to this expensive and restrict technology, it is
presented a simpler technique through image manipulation on software OsiriX,
aiming to reduce both exposures.</p></sec><sec><title>OBJECTIVE</title><p>To analyze the efficacy of the adoption of a study protocol and a

performed endovascular aneurysm repair were compared to a historic control

tomographic image manipulation in the prospective group was performed with
OsiriX MD software. A script-based guide upon gathering detailed computed
tomography angiography images was elaborated by the author and distributed
to the performing surgical team for appreciation, instruction and pre
operatory judgment. Based upon the script, the C-arm gantry angle was
specifically corrected in each case of endovascular aneurysm repair, for
image optimization and aneurysm's neck visualization. Arteriography was
performed under digital subtraction angiography after catheters were
positioned according to predicted level description in the referred guide.

modality and tool for aortic disease evaluation most widely used by vascular
surgeons. Multidetector devices can acquire thinner slices in reduced time,
generating high definition images resolution over one single contrast injection.
Therefore, they are essential for three-dimensional reconstructions, with plenty of
detailment in any selected incidence. Despite the ionizing radiation exposure, this
modality of image acquisition is viable, fast, efficient and high
cost-benefit<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. However,
the angiotomography study produces a large series of digital data with difficult
handling, wherein interpretation and discrimination of the variations are better
accessed when post processed in softwares, as in multiplanar reconstructions, volume
rendering and maximum intensity projection<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The evaluation of these tomographic images consists of three main tasks: determining
the eligibility for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), choosing the appropriate
graft and simulate an intervention plan. For preoperative planning, several
anatomical factors must be accessed, including neck localization and morphology in
relation to major branches of the aortic axis, to establish the endograft landing
zones, it's diameters to choose the device's size, the iliac and femoral arteries'
conditions towards the vascular access site<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>It is known that in this endovascular modality, time of procedure and radiation doses
to the patient and surgical staff may be substantial<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. The increasing frequency of these procedures and
its complexity has impelled vascular surgeons to face additional and successive risk
to occupational radiation exposure<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. Meticulous study of the CTA during the procedure's planning
allows reduction of unnecessary exposure, beyond the use of consecutive contrast
image acquisition - that may contribute to renal overload and chronic renal disease
development, especially in patients with diabetic nephropathy or any kind of
pre-existent renal impairment<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Of these, the contrast induced nephropathy (CIN) may vary from 12% to 50% after
exposure, thus it should be one of the main concerns about EVAR<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. The Contrast Media Safety
Committee (CMSC) states CIN as a condition whereas renal injury (an increase of 25%
over serum creatinine level or 44 umol/L) occurs within 3 days after intravascular
contrast infusion and no other etiology involved<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Several studies have proposed strategies to optimize endovascular intervention in
reducing renal contrast overload and ionizing radiation exposure<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>. Such steps might prove effective, however rely
solely on use of additional features, specific and sophisticated equipment,
available only in major centers.</p><p>Aiming to reduce both exposures related to the use of contrast and ionizing
radiation, we believe instead that it's possible to use a simpler technique through
image manipulation on software (OsiriX, Pixmeo Labs, Geneva, Switzerland) as an
alternative to this expensive technology. In this present article we propose the
adoption of a study protocol in preparation for EVAR, gathering detailed information
of the aneurysm's morphologic aspects, its spatial relation to bone structures that
may be visualized under fluoroscopy with immediate applicability - allowing reducing
operatory time, prolonged exposure to radiation and iodinated intravascular use.</p><p>The primary aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of the adoption of a study
protocol and a script-based guide in preparation for EVAR. Within the protocol
application, detailed individualized data of patient's radiographic characteristics
was collected and applied as a script to intraoperative steps - which allowed to
verify the protocol impact over the surgical procedure, as referred to intravascular
contrast infuse, effects over renal function, blood loss and operatory time.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>A longitudinal prospective study was performed from March 2014 through March 2015. A
non randomized convenience group was selected, with patients diagnosed with
infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) treated at the High Complexity Center for
Endovascular Surgery at the State University of Campinas (Unicamp). Within this
period, 30 of the 34 performed EVAR were included for statistical analysis. These
surgeries were followed by the author in each step of the planning, endovascular
execution and postoperative time at the intensive care unit (ICU). Patients with
ruptured AAA treated by EVAR and surgeries that the author could not follow, for any
reason, any part of planning or execution were excluded from statistical
analysis.</p><p>All EVAR were performed over a radio-transparent table in an operatory room, equipped
with a C-arm fluoroscopy device (General Electric 9800 Plus - GE OEC Medical
Systems, Inc., USA), with a 15 inches visual field.</p><p>The control group (historic) is composed by 28 elective EVAR performed between
January 2009 and December 2010. At that time, the preparatory plan was not made as
in this present model - the main tool of this study's analysis.</p><p>For both groups, the X-ray tube was positioned under the operating table and the
fluoroscopic image capture was performed in pulsed mode at a 7.5 frames per second
(FPS). The digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was used at moments of image
capture for aneurysm's neck visualization and control arteriography for aneurysm sac
exclusion under a 15 FPS rate. Data of fluoroscopy time, DSA time, total air kerma
X-ray cumulative dose were registered in the prospective group, provided
automatically by the device's software. It was not possible to retrieve the same
informations in the historic group, because they were not described in patients'
files.</p><p>The planning for EVAR through the patient's tomographic image manipulation in the
prospective group was performed through OsiriX MD software (Pixmeo Labs., Geneve,
Switzerland). The stages were composed of: 1) identification of the C-arm gantry
angle for the ostial visualization of the neck's lowest renal artery within the
virtual geometric correction<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>;
2) renal arteries' spatial marks and three-dimensional by volume rendering under
virtual fluoroscopy preset<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>; 3)
recording of complementary information that were essential to visualize and
recognize the aneurism's neck during the intra-operatory time, such as renal artery
positioning under fluoroscopic view related to bone structures (vertebrae,
osteo-degenerative individual characteristics) and other details that helped to
foresee angiographic catheter positioning for optimal image acquisition. A script
based upon gathering these images and registered information was elaborated by the
author and distributed to the performing surgical team (fellows and medical
assistants) a day before the surgery for appreciation, instruction and pre operatory
judgment, as exemplified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>

</p><p>Based upon the script, the C-arm gantry angle was specifically corrected in each case
of EVAR, for image optimization and aneurysm's neck visualization and lowest renal
artery's ostial exposure. Arteriography was performed under DSA, after insertion of
the endoprosthesis infrarenal main body, with the image capture at the centre of the
radioscopic field. Manual intra-arterial injection of nonionic iso osmolar iodinated
contrast (Omnipaque 300 mg/mL) was performed with the patient under temporary apnea.
At this moment, a guide-catheter or the prosthesis sheath itself was positioned
right under the bone reference for the lowest renal artery's position (under
fluoroscopic view, predicted by the virtual fluoroscopy). Endovascular devices
compounded by a separated sheath (Endologix AFX and Gore Excluder), the contrast
injection was made with 10 mL of pure iodinated flushed by 20 mL of saline bolus. In
those conjunct to the delivery sheath (Cook Zenith, Medtronic Endurant, Lombard
Medical Aorfix), the iodinated contrast was diluted to saline in equal parts of 10
mL and injected through a RDC or MP guide-catheter.</p><p>All participants were hospitalized under preoperative hydration (saline infusion of
1-1.5 ml/kg.h), administered to N-acetylcysteine (NAC) (600 mg twice daily) and had
suspension of nephrotoxic drugs. Additionally, according to our institutional
protocols, for patients with renal impairment (serum creatinine over 1.8 mg/dL), it
was given isotonic sodium bicarbonate (150 mL Bic 8.4% diluted to 850 mL NaCl 0.9%)
in a dose of 3 mL/kg of body weight 1h prior to procedure and 1 mL/kg.hr within the
next 6 hours. All patients were referred to postoperative medical care at the ICU.
Laboratory tests (hemogram, hydroelectrolytic and renal profile) were collected at
admission and daily for the first 72h.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed, with the Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests for
two qualitative categories or likelihood ratio (more than two categories). A
statistical significance level of 5% was considered (<italic>P</italic> value &#x0003c;

contrast used or preparatory study technique for endovascular repair.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The study of CTA in the preoperative period of EVAR has an essential role in not only
planning the type of endoprosthesis that should be used, but also offers the
possibility of detailed analysis of the aneurysm morphological characteristics, such
as its length, visceral involvement, tortuosity and angulation<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Image high-resolution multislice equipment allows refinement of its processing as
well as reducing the time of acquisition and improvement of the spatial resolution
into thinner slices<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Thus, the greater the ability to process these images, the larger is the number of
information from the CTA exam can be extracted. Our hypothesis consisted in applying
these informations intraoperatively, resulting in less need of contrast use to
perform angiograms and thereby reducing surgical time (with consequent lower
exposure time to ionizing radiation). This would be achieved by the detailed study
of each patient's individual characteristics, with foreknowledge of topographic
positioning of visceral arteries and their respective references under fluoroscopic
visualization, anticipation of intraluminal positioning of angiographic catheters
and correction of the X-ray beam incidence angle of the fluoroscopic device,
techniques already published during the pilot study<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In the present study it was possible to demonstrate the impact of the adoption of a
script based on the compilation of these information collected during the
preoperative planning, on considerable reduction of intravascular contrast use,
surgical time and blood loss, compared to a previous period where this kind of
script-based planning did not happen as current.</p><p>Consequently, one would expect that the prospective group could present significant
outcomes when comparing the volume of contrast used and manifestation of renal
toxicity.We did not find, however, that the reduction of the use of contrast was
directly related to the reduction in renal overload in both compared groups, because
in our sample only one patient in the prospective group and two from historical
expressed an increase of 25% of serum creatinine compared to baseline, with no
statistical significance. Fortunately, the evolution to acute renal failure is
rare<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Although is expected a higher incidence of CIN to intraarterial administration
compared to intravenous, this known related risk is expected in patients with
established chronic kidney disease. For intravenously administered contrast, several
studies have shown that the risk of CIN is a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less
than 45 ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>. For intraarterial administration, it maintains a
GFR cutoff point of 60 mL/ min/1.73m<sup>2[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>. In our study, 16
patients from the prospective group and 20 from the control group presented such
risk, however, into none of these there was a significant increase in serum
creatinine in the postoperative period.</p><p>There are other risk factors for the occurrence of NIC: diabetic nephropathy,
dehydration, congestive heart failure, age over 70, low hematocrit, hypotension and
concomitant use of nephrotoxic drugs<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>. The incidence of
CIN is also related to the dose of the used contrast. It is suggested that the dose
in grams of iodine is numerically equal to the GFR in mls/min<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>. While the risk of nephropathy is dose-dependent, it is
recommended that patients with less than 60 GFR the administered contrast volume
shall be less than 100 ml<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Compared to the literature, Alsac et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> cites the average intraoperative use of contrast around
137.5 mL (for infrarenal fixation) and 157.9 mL (for suprarenal fixation
stent-grafts). Badger et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>
divide between elective and emergency surgery groups, with average contrast use of
163.9 mL for the first and for the second 187.1 mL. Multicentric trials as OVER
(Open Versus Endovascular Repair Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study Group,
USA)<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> and DREAM (Dutch
Randomized Endovascular Aneurysm Management, Holland)<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> describe the mean use of contrast of 132.5 mL e
167 mL, respectively.</p><p>Canyigit et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> suggest the
categorical selective catheterization of the lowest renal artery using a
angiographic catheter Simmons-1 as a proximal landmark during the deployment of the
stent graft, reducing the use of contrast to 47 mL per procedure. Regardless of the
results, this technique should be considered with reservations since the selective
catheterization is not risk free, may be associated with distal embolization,
dissection and acute thrombosis. In our study, just through the manipulation and
study of CTA images plus adoption of a script-based guide, the average use of
contrast decreased to 32 mL - compared to the average historical use of 285 mL. This
proves that a meticulous pre-procedure study during EVAR preparation should be
incorporated routinely, eliminating unnecessary sequences of image acquisition by
digital subtraction.</p><p>Despite the CMSC defines that the tracking for diagnostics of CIN takes place in a
period of 3 days<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>, the
short-term TFG can also be influenced by many factors during the perioperative
period - such as the duration of the procedure, anesthetic drugs, nephrotoxic
contrasts - and so it might not be a reliable evidence of permanent renal
dysfunction<sup>[<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>.
Therefore, there is the recommendation of postoperative GFR calculation after 1
month of the procedure<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>. This
conduct is not part of routine in our service and can serve as a suggestion to be
adopted for outpatient follow-up.</p><p>Prophylactically, it is performed in our Service vigorous hydration before and after
surgery with saline solution associated with pre-procedural intravenous
administration of NAC. Although some authors advocate that the beneficial effect of
this conduct is in the volume expansion with improvement in renal blood flow, in
diuresis induction and dilution of the contrast material; others advocate the
preferential use of sodium bicarbonate, in suspicion that urine alkalinization
decreases the generation of toxic free radicals to the renal parenchyma. Anyway,
volumetric expansion (hydration) is considered as degree of recommendation I,
evidence level C. The NAC management is controversial, by showing conflicting
results in the literature (Class IIb, level of evidence A)<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The support of these patients after surgery is performed at the ICU, and hydration is
strictly monitored by the attending intensivist. In both groups, for almost all
cases, it was observed an improvement in serum creatinine levels compared to
baseline, allowing us to assume that the intensive care did not allow the
installation of the NIC even in patients at increased risk, while directed to volume
expansion and reduction of renal toxicity.</p><p>In this type of surgical management, it is justified the patient and medical staff
exposure to X-ray, combined with the unique benefits of minimally invasive surgery,
as well as minor recovery time and postoperative hospital stay, as an option for
patients not elected to conventional open repair<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The combined effect over the increasing number of endovascular interventions,
complexity and time of procedure associated to the intraoperative coaching to
fellows in institutions has become major occupational radiation exposure to the
assistant surgeon<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>This risk-benefit related to the use of radiation should lead doctors to work under
minimal exposure required to achieve adequate image quality while allowing safety
and effectiveness in procedures. This principle of reduction of X-ray exposure is
referred as ALARA (as low as reasonably achieveble). To achieve this goal, different
strategies should be combined, since configurations techniques to the X-ray unit up
to good medical practice<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Careful planning that includes CTA image studies with three-dimensional
reconstructions allows the surgeon to predict details such as appropriate landmarks
of deployment to the different components of the stent-graft. Optimal positioning of
the patient and the device often can be established prior to the procedure, then
fully reducing the total fluoroscopic surgical time<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Under virtual fluoroscopy, the data manipulation of the irradiated dose distribution
on a surface allows to visualize as opaque areas of high contrast (like bone
surfaces) and as transparent low attenuation values (soft tissue). Guided by marks
of the renal arteries, it can be carefully foreseen its anatomical position in
relation to its visualization on real-time fluoroscopy. The anticipation of the
correct positioning of the radioscopic unit with this technique use allows obtaining
image with the minimum of interference from the parallax effect. It is therefore
possible decrease the number of angiograms in trying to obtain the best image that
provides the localization of renal arteries and the aneurysm neck<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The intraoperative image during EVAR is limited to two-dimensional details that
depict only the arterial lumen and contrasting requires repeated acquisitions. To
accomplish optimal outcomes the surgeon must comprehend the geometry of the
fluoroscopic image formation and the various adjustments to the C-arm unit that can
clarify more complex vascular anatomy. When angulating the X-ray tube in order to
fix its incidence for a perpendicular beam to the axis of the aneurysm neck
(proximal margin of sealing), the endoprosthesis presents itself in its ideal
position with no risk of accidental coverage of the renal artery<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. This effect can be achieved by the
renal artery's ostial projection under virtual geometric correction, implemented
through OsiriX software<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>As a result of the adoption of this new protocol in the present analysis, there was
found a significant decrease of surgical time. Therefore, one can assume a
substantial reduction in the exposure to ionizing radiation to patients as well as a
lower exposure of the interventionalist team. But when compared to literature data,
this average fluoroscopy time was longer. For the same kind of procedure, also
performed with a C-arm, Geijer, Weiss, and Maurel Kalef-Ezra reported respectively
mean values of 28.4, 20.6, 22.6 and 11.2 min. (<italic>vs.</italic> 33.3
min.)<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. This further
reinforces a constant need for specific protective training for radiation exposure,
use of barrier vests, beam collimators and enhancement in efforts to cut down on
unnecessary fluoroscopy, when the surgeon is not directly being guided by the X-ray
image in exchange of catheters or saline infusion.</p><p>Bicknell<sup>[<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> emphasizes that simple
measures to protect the surgical team to the exposure may not be enough. Thus,
technological advances in low-dose imaging presented by large companies in this
field are a major step in reducing radiation dose while maintaining image quality
for performing complex procedures.</p><p>This process is vital in continuous techniques that reduce the need for repeated DSA.
The fusion of either pre- or intraoperative sectional images is clearly effective in
reducing the radiation exposure - and other imaging technologies such as
intravascular ultrasound can complement these approaches. Further, the use of
advanced technology will allow the surgeon's withdrawal from source of radiation, as
in robotic surgery (Magellan, Hansen Medical, Mountain View, CA, USA)<sup>[<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy
that the cost of these new technologies makes them a limited access, not allowing
its wide spread use, only for major international technology centers.</p><p>Although it's known that EVAR is associated with less blood loss when compared to the
conventional approach by open surgery, the bleeding can also occur through the
puncture sites and around large introducer sheaths - by handling of catheters and
guidewires as well as complications during the closure of the access
sites<sup>[<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup>. Thus,
unnecessary maneuvering, repeated exchanges of catheters of different formats,
sheaths and rigid guide wires (which in turn may force the introducer's diaphragm
leading to malfunction of hemostatic valves) significantly increase the bleeding
during the procedure. In the present study, there was a significant reduction to
about a quarter the bleeding in the prospective arm compared to the historical
control group (204.3 <italic>vs.</italic> 798.1 mL), while loss are described in the
literature from 200 mL to 394 mL<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>. Thus, it is
realized that the preparation and anticipation of the steps promoted by the script
allow surgical technique with perfection and eliminating additional steps that would
have little impact on the course of surgery and it certainly would collaborate to a
massive bleeding.</p><p>The main limitation of this study was to monitor the variables for the retrospective
nature of the historical control group because it was not possible to compare to the
prospective arm data of irradiation dose as well as fluoroscopy time and
endovascular execution, not described in the medical record - plus the occurrence of
replacement of the X-ray equipment by another one of distinct brand in this
interval. This is also a fellowship scenario where the trainees participate actively
in the surgical procedure and have their own learning curve - that may have
influenced total operating time and fluoroscopy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This study presents a simple technique and of great practical importance in planning
interventional treatments. The ability to manipulate digital formats of medical
images allows the recovery of a larger volume of data and allows that interventional
procedures can be performed more efficiently, with less time for image projection
adjustment, contrast injections and exposure to ionizing radiation. As a result, we
obtained impact in relation to the improvement of the surgical technique, translated
into less use of contrast, reduced surgical time and intraoperative bleeding.</p><table-wrap id="t3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1">

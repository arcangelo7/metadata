Due to direct exposure to thermal, mechanical, and chemical damage, skin defects such as burns, ulcers, and other skin loss may easily happen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Wounds, especially extensive full-thickness wounds, cannot heal spontaneously. Therefore, a wound dressing is needed to cover these wounds.</p><p>An ideal wound dressing may possess many features to protect the wound and to reconstruct the physical barrier in the wound. For instance, superior mechanical properties are important for protecting the wound from mechanical damage; a satisfactory water vapor transmission rate and fluid uptake ability can provide a moist microenvironment to accelerate wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Favorable histocompatibility is also an important feature to guarantee safety when the wound dressing is applied to the wound. Overall, an ideal wound dressing should protect against contamination, outside disturbances, and a loss of elements from the body. At the same time, the dressing should supply a suitable microenvironment for wound healing or wound bed preparation.</p><p>Before a new wound dressing is permitted to be tested in a clinical trial, it is very important to investigate the wound-healing process when the wound dressing is applied in an animal model. So far, several different types of animal models have been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. For instance, a full-thickness skin defect Bama pig model was used to study a new type of dermal equivalent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], a circular full-thickness wound model in Sprague-Dawley rats was used to evaluate a chitin film compared with gauze [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and a full-thickness round-wound model in mice was used to investigate a physiologically active polysaccharide hydrogel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, studies often aim to study the structure, physical properties, safety, and histocompatibility of wound dressings; a systematic, detailed, and precise evaluation of the bio-function of wound dressings in the wound healing is lacking in most of these studies.</p><p>The purpose of the present study was to provide a systematic way to evaluate the effect of wound dressings on wound healing. Two types of full-thickness wound models in mice were used to study wound dressings, and a way to quantitatively analyze the wound-healing process and the histological results was established.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animals</title><p>BALB/c mice (male, 18&#x02013;20&#x000a0;g) were purchased from the Experimental Animal Department of the Third Military Medical University. All of the animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Third Military Medical University. The animals were individually housed in plastic cages and were fed sterile rodent chow and water ad libitum.

By using hair removal cream, it is easy to remove the hair without any damage to the mouse&#x02019;s skin.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Mouse full-thickness wound surgery</title><p>The dorsal part of each mouse was disinfected with iodophors, followed by a rinse with 75&#x000a0;% (<italic>v/v</italic>) ethanol. Two types of wound models were used here: a two-wound model created using a sterile biopsy punch, with a diameter of each wound of 0.4&#x000a0;cm, and a larger one-wound model created on the back of the mouse with sterile scissors and tweezers, with a wound size of 1&#x000a0;cm&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;1&#x000a0;cm.</p><p>A sterile round marker (diameter 0.4&#x000a0;cm) or a square marker (area 1&#x000a0;cm<sup>2</sup>) was placed next to the wound, which was immediately photographed using a digital camera. The marker was used to measure the wound area, and the photograph was taken vertical to the wound and the marker to avoid bias.</p><p>The test wound dressing (TWD) was sutured and dressed on the wound with a 6.0 nylon. The TWD used in this study was a patented microporous membrane, and a wound without any treatment served as a control.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Critical step</title><p>The control group is very important for wound-dressing studies and should be appropriately chosen based on your own experimental design. For example, traditional wounds treated with Vaseline gauze or other types of wound dressings or wounds without any treatment can be used as the control group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Measurement of the wound area</title><p>At day 3 and day 7 post-surgery, the wound dressing was removed, and the wound was photographed. Based on the picture, the area of the wound was measured using IPP 6.0 software. Briefly, the margin of each wound and the marker were carefully traced, and the number of pixels encompassing each wound and marker was calculated. As the area of the marker was known, the number of pixels corresponding with the wound was then converted into square centimeters, after which the rate of wound healing could be calculated as follows:<disp-formula id="Equa"><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Wound contraction is a key parameter for wound closure in mice; however, it is not notable in human wounds, in which re-epithelialization is considered more important than wound contraction. The skin structure and wound-healing mechanism of the mouse are different from those of humans, which is the limitation of mouse wound models. However, we believe that a mouse model is still a useful research tool for preclinical study, and it is relatively low in cost and easy to use compared with pig and other models. In addition, mouse models have been widely used for wound-dressing evaluation or wound-healing research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, here, we presented two types of wound models, i.e., a two-wound round-wound model and a one-wound square-wound model (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The wound model should be appropriately chosen based on your own experimental design. The two-wound model is much better for controlling for biological variation because the TWD group and control group can be studied within one mouse, which is always better than a control from a different animal. However, when we try to evaluate more than three types of wound dressings at one time, it is impossible to create so many wounds on one mouse. In this case, the one-wound model can be used. Additionally, a large wound makes it easy for us to observe the wound-healing process and to find differences among different groups. To control for biological variation when the one-wound model is used, the mice should be of the same sex and should have similar weights and hair follicle cycles. In addition, the mice should be randomly assigned to the different groups.</p><p>As a moist environment is conducive to wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], wounds that were moist and clean, without too much exudate, were beneficial to wound healing (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). In contrast, a red and swollen wound with a scab or with extensive inflammatory exudate might hamper wound healing (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). By observing the wounds treated with different wound dressings and analyzing the rates of wound healing in the different groups, the best dressing could be identified.</p><p>Granulation tissue is very important for wound healing because it fills the defect, prevents bacterial invasion, and prepares the matrix for cell proliferation and migration. Re-epithelialization is also an important factor for wound closure. Therefore, the thickness of the granulation tissue and the length of the epithelial tongue were measured based on the sections in our study. The thickness of the granulation tissue and the length of the epithelial tongue in the TWD group were increased compared with those in the control group, which indicated that the TWD was conducive to wound healing (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).</p><p>Modulation of the inflammatory response is also an important factor during the wound-healing process. It has been reported that androgens could reduce the inflammatory response, thus resulting in accelerated wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Hence, the attenuated inflammatory response in the wound tissue in the TWD group further supported the hypothesis that the corresponding wound dressing was conducive to wound healing (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). In our research, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages, among other cells, were all automatically identified as inflammatory cells, counted and highlighted by IPP 6.0 software, according to the cell morphology. In this way, this software saves time when we have to examine dozens of histopathological pictures. However, the limitation of this method is that cells without typical morphology may be identified incorrectly. Thus, if we want to identify and count the cells in a precise way, we prefer to do it manually.</p><p>As newly formed epidermis is fragile, without the support of the mature dermal matrix, the thickness of the newly formed epidermis is important for protecting the healed area. A comparatively thicker epidermis might indicate a better skin barrier, and the corresponding wound dressing might be better than the others (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).</p><p>Collagen is the main component of the dermal matrix. Compared with the control group, the more mature and better aligned collagen fibers in the healed wound tissue indicated that a better quality of healing was established when the TWD was applied (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Here, we should note that although measurement of the density of collagen fibers based on histopathological pictures has been widely used in many studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], there are many other ways that are more precise for collagen assessment, such as Western blotting or the determination of hydroxyproline expression.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In the study, a systematic, quantitative way to analyze the effect of a wound dressing on wound healing was established. By analyzing the wound-healing process and the histological results in the way presented here, a new wound dressing could be evaluated using an animal model before it was permitted to be tested in a clinical trial. Our study might be helpful for the design of wound dressing in the future.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AWi</term><def><p>area of the initial wound</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AWn</term><def><p>remaining area of the wound on the nth day post-surgery</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HE</term><def><p>hematoxylin and eosin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IPP 6.0</term><def><p>Image-Pro Plus 6.0</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p>standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SPSS</term><def><p>Statistical Package for the Social Sciences</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TWD</term><def><p>test wound dressing</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p>Xiaorong Zhang and Rui Xu contributed equally to this work.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>XRZ, RX, and WFH conceived of the study, participated in its design and coordination and statistical analysis, and helped to draft the manuscript.

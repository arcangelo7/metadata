pride in announcing that the Brazilian Registry of Cardiovascular Surgery in Adults (The
Bypass Registry) is currently fully operational and the inclusion has exceeded 1500
patients in the first nine months of operation. This success is the aftermath of the
serious, diligent and willful work of the Brazilian cardiovascular surgeons involved in
the project.</p><p>The establishment of the Brazilian Registry of Cardiovascular Surgery in Adults sets a
long-standing need for fundamental understanding of the real figures for the country
pertaining to the cardiovascular surgery practice and as a result to develop strategies
for improvements in quality and excellence.</p><p>The Project is an enterprise of the SBCCV along with the HCor Research Institute and aims
to document the practice of cardiovascular surgeries throughout the national territory,
in centers of all Brazilian states, including public (university and nonuniversity) and
private hospitals. Surgical procedures included in the registry encompass coronary
artery bypass surgery, valve surgery, aortic surgery, atrial fibrillation procedures,
heart transplantation, mechanical circulatory support, and congenital heart defects in
adults.</p><p>With the SBCCV increasingly being introduced to the international community of
cardiovascular surgery and being recognized, steps still need to be traversed in order
to reach the quality standards of first world countries.</p><p>The Registry is a database designed to collect a multiplicity of clinical parameters of
patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery in Brazil, and uniquely this study will
followed up late the patients, from discharge extending for assessment in 30 days, 6
months and 12 months to evaluate cardiovascular events in the medium- and long-term.</p><p>The project also will require effort, goodwill and willingness of the participating
centers and those in charge of data collection, since, currently, the project is funded
solely by SBCCV and consequently budget constraints apply.</p><p>The stored data is a classified information (only the institution itself is to have
access to their own data) and analyzed together to develop best practices in
cardiovascular surgery in Brazilian hospitals. It will be examined to plan future
improvement of clinical practice programs, improve quality, optimize outcomes and serve
as a base for clinical studies, to determine resource utilization, and others. Such
information is not available today in a database that includes all kind of patients,
since the only available database is that of the public health system. We hope that this
could provide basis for health policy planning at local, regional and national
levels.</p><p>Data from new centers are to be added, as the inclusion process is open and active. Our
initial fourteen centers are expanding and we reiterate the invitation to centers from
all over the country to join and participate in this endeavor. Come be part of the
BYPASS PROJECT.</p><p>Thank you all.</p></body></article>

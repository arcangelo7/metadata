heart syndrome (HLHS) is responsible for more than 25% of deaths from congenital
heart disease in the first week of life<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. Ninety-five percent of patients with this condition, if not
submitted to palliative surgery, evolve to death in the first month of
life<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The management of HLHS continues today as one of the major challenges in pediatric
heart surgery. The experience gained over the past 20 years, including an
improvement in the medical and surgical management of this condition, has elected
the surgical staging as preference in most centers worldwide. However, the Norwood
operation for HLHS has a significantly higher mortality than other surgeries
performed in the neonatal period<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Given the high initial mortality in Norwood procedure, some centers in the 90s
developed an alternative option, known as "hybrid procedure" (by the combination of
a surgical procedure and an interventional catheterization), consisting of a stent
implant in the ductus arteriosus to keep it open, associated with regulation of
pulmonary blood flow through the banding of the pulmonary artery branches, and
septostomy of the interatrial septum. The "hybrid" route for HLHS has been developed
in centers with high mortality in the Norwood operation, due to its lower eventual
mortality in the initial stage and its potential advantage in avoiding circulatory
arrest and deep hypothermia inherent to the Norwood operation<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Thus, the hybrid procedure for handling HLHS was developed as an alternative to the
Norwood procedure, in the neonatal period, providing a less invasive initial
palliative treatment and, in most cases, with lower costs, becoming a great
therapeutic option in an attempt to reduce mortality associated with the Norwood
procedure<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Countless variables have been associated with the increased surgical mortality rate.
Palliative surgery performed after the second week of life is considered an
important risk factor in the treatment of HLHS<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The prenatal diagnosis also helps to improve survival after the first stage of the
palliative surgery when compared to postnatal diagnosis, since it allows a better
child labor arrangement, which shall be conducted in an appropriate referral
facility, besides the early infusion of prostaglandin (PGL2), to help maintain a
systemic cardiac output through the ductus arteriosus and, consequently, maintain
the newborn clinically stable for carrying out the first stage of the heart
surgery<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The Brazilian Northeast region is needy for specialized care for the treatment of
congenital heart diseases. According to DATASUS (Department of Informatics of the
Brazilian Unified Health System), there is an annual deficit of 75.1% on surgical
procedures for children with congenital heart disease in the region. Associated with
this matter, the transfer of these children to hospitals in the Brazilian Southeast
region depends on a national referral policy, which requires an extended holding
time, resulting in the worsening of prognosis of the treatment or even in the
child's death<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Based on its lower cost, no need for cardiopulmonary bypass and the little experience
of our group with the Norwood surgical technique, we decided to start a modified
hybrid treatment for HLHS at the end of 2012.</p><p>The aim of this study is to describe the initial experience of a center in the
Brazilian Northeast region with a modified offpump hybrid palliation for HLHS, which
consists in a combined intraoperative stenting of the ductus arteriosus without
contrast and banding of the main pulmonary artery branches.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>From November 2012 through November 2015, the medical records of all patients
diagnosed with HLHS who underwent the hybrid procedure were retrospectively
evaluated. This study was carried out in a tertiary private hospital of the
Northeast Brazilian region, which provides services to the Unified Health System
in a complementary way.</p></sec><sec><title>Variables</title><p>Demographic and clinical variables were recorded for descriptive analysis, which
included: age, sex, weight, intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, mortality
and progression to the second stage of the surgical treatment (Norwood-Glenn
procedure). Early mortality was defined as death occurring within 30 days of
surgery or before hospital discharge.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>A descriptive analysis of data was performed. Qualitative variables were
expressed by percentage and quantitative variables by median and percentile
(p25% and p75%).</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics</title><p>Written informed consent was obtained from the parents before all the hybrid
procedures.</p><p>In accordance with the Resolution 466/12 of the MOH of Brazil, this case series
study was approved by the Ethics Review Board under protocol number CAAE:
58105616.1.0000.5084 and Consolidated Report No. 1.665.194.</p></sec><sec><title>Operative Technique</title><p>The modified hybrid procedure is usually performed in the catheterization
laboratory under general anesthesia. The patient is monitorized with a 5-lead
electrocardiogram, an arterial line inserted in the left radial artery, a 4
French venous central line in the right internal jugular vein, an esophageal
thermometer probe and also a capnometer and a peripheral oxymeter for
measurement of CO2 and oxygen saturation levels, respectively.</p><p>The approach is through a median thoracotomy. The procedure begins with the
banding of the pulmonary artery branches using a 3.5 mm polytetrafluoroethylene
(PTFE) graft, which we cut into a rectangular small piece of 3 x 22 mm. After
wrapping the pulmonary artery branches, the banding is secured with a 6-0
Prolene<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> suture (Ethicon, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil) in
order to reduce 10 points from baseline oxygen saturation and consequently
increase by 10 mmHg the baseline median arterial pressure. At the end, we cut
the excess of PTFE. The final aspect of the banding is shown on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>
<fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Final aspect of the pulmonary banding.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-32-03-0210-g01"/></fig>
</p><p>The measurement of the length and diameter of the proximal and distal end of the
ductus arteriosus is done preoperatively using a transthoracic echocardiogram
Vivid S5 (GE<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Fairfield, USA) with a 2.7-8 MHz pediatric
transducer. These measurements facilitate the choice of the stent size. The
adventitia of the origin and of the distal end of the ductus arteriosus is
marked with metal clips to guide the stent deployment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). After that, a circular 6-0
Prolene<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Ethicon, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil) purse-string
suture is placed in the pulmonary trunk, where the introducer is inserted,
approximately 0.5 to 1 cm below the proximal end of the ductus arteriosus
allowing the stent's release in the correct position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>
<fig id="f2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Placement of the metal clips and a circular 6-0

</p><p>Under radioscopic view using Integris Allura 12C (Philips<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>,
Amsterdam, Holland), the stent is deployed through the previously positioned
introducer, having the adventitial clips as reference markers. Thus, this
modification of the technique precludes the use of contrast and the need for
peripheral arterial punctures and cardiopulmonary bypass. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref> shows the final surgical and radiographic aspects
of the modified hybrid procedure.</p><p>

</p><p>In all 8 cases, as the atrial septal defects (ASD) were not considered
restrictive on the preoperative echocardiographic assessment, a balloon atrial
septostomy was not performed. Serial echocardiograms were carried out at 30 days
after discharge and every three months thereafter.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Eight patients were included in this study, of whom 37.5% were female. The median age
and weight at the time of the procedure was 2 days (ranging from 2 to 10 days) and
3150 grams (ranging from 2945 to 3600 grams), respectively. The median length of ICU
stay was 6 days (ranging from 2 to 24 days).</p><p>There were no in-hospital deaths in this series. Two (25%) deaths occurred after
hospital discharge, one of which was consequent to pneumonia two months after the
procedure. The other case occurred three months after completion of the first stage
of palliation, secondary to decompensated cardiogenic shock due to a restrictive
atrial septal defect.</p><p>The mean follow-up was 138,6 days (60-284 days). Four (50%) children have
successfully undergone to the second stage of the treatment of HLHS (Norwood-Glenn
procedure), while two were still waiting to have this procedure done at the
completion of this study, since they were only three months old at that time. All

heart diseases. Despite of the recent data reflecting a continuous improvement of
the outcomes in the world's best centers of pediatric cardiology, the mortality rate
is still high, especially in less experienced institutions<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The advantage of the modified technique presented in this case series in comparison
to the standard hybrid procedure<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>
resides on the fact that the insertion of the stent is conducted under fluoroscopic
view using the metallic clips placed on the pulmonary artery wall as radiographic
markers for its proper deployment, which precludes completely the use of any ionic
or non-ionic contrast media.</p><p>The main difference is the stenting technique. On the original procedure, the stent
is placed under angiographic control using radiologic contrast: "through a sheath in
the main pulmonary artery, using angiographic control, an appropriate sized stent is
placed"<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>; while in the
current study, this technique was modified by deploying the stent under radioscopic
view having adventitial metal clips as reference markers. Thus, this modification
precludes the use of contrast as proposed on the original technique.</p><p>We have tried to perform the hybrid procedure as early as possible (median of two
days of life). However, two of our patients who underwent the procedure at 6 and 10
days of life. Although some studies<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> present an average age of about 7 days of life, in our
experience this delay reflected the difficulty to obtain early diagnosis of the
condition, as well as the failure to refer the pregnant women to deliver their
children in one of the pediatric cardiac surgery specialized facilities of our
region.</p><p>Previous study analyzing mortality, after the hybrid procedure, have shown a survival
rate of 80% to 97%<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. Our results
have also shown favorable outcomes related to early mortality, since there were no
deaths among the 8 patients analyzed. This fact has driven us to continue treating
this complex heart disease in a mid-sized facility in the Northeast region of
Brazil.</p><p>However, during clinical follow-up, there was one death due to pneumonia after
hospital discharge. Another death occurred three months after completion of the
first stage, secondary to decompensated cardiogenic shock due to a restrictive
atrial septal defect, reflecting the difficulty of maintaining clinical follow-up
continuity of our patients because of a lack of specialized professionals in the
primary care network at our state. To minimize this matter, we have set up a
specialized team for the treatment of complex pathologies<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>, since that there has been an increased number of
cases referred to our care.</p><p>According to Honjo et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>. the
one-year survival is equivalent among children undergoing the Norwood and hybrid
procedure (69.2% <italic>vs.</italic> 73.7%, respectively, <italic>P</italic>=0.83),
however we have not found reports indicating if the length of hospital stay after
these two approaches are also equivalent. In our study, we present a median length
of stay in the ICU of 6 days.</p><p>Among the patients studied, 50% already performed the second surgical stage, and 2
patients were not at the appropriate age and weight to perform this procedure.
Because of the deaths occurred, we have tried to keep the continuous monitoring,
monthly, which was only possible after assembling a specialized multidisciplinary
team, as suggested by Anuradha et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>, to complement the assistance given to people in the public
health care network.</p><p>The hybrid procedure has become the procedure of choice in many care facilities
around the world because of neither requiring cardiopulmonary bypass nor deep
hypothermic circulatory arrest; it can be performed in a shorter surgical time with
lower risk of neurological damage, when compared to the Norwood surgery<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>We believe that the technical variant developed by our team is feasible and
reproducible and gathers advantage to the original technique<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> by avoiding the use of intravenous
contrast for the stent implantation and by reducing the risks of complications with
the administration of such compounds in low-weight patients.</p><p>The preliminary measurement of the ductus arteriosus by the echocardiogram and the
use of metallic clips at its both ends help the stent deployment, avoiding the use
of intravenous contrast. This advantage translates into a probable reduction of
clinical complications; however, it will only be possible to confirm statistically
this finding with a greater number of treated patients in our facility. Thus, the
retrospective design and the small sample are the limitations of the current
study.</p><p>Despite all technological advances, the treatment of HLHS still presents a challenge
to physicians, especially in a region where 75% of children are not surgically
treated<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>. Throughout the
analysis of our results, we could glimpse a hope on the care for the complex heart
diseases in northeastern Brazil.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In this series, the initial experience with the modified offpump hybrid procedure
showed to be safe, allowing a low early mortality rate among children presenting
HLHS. However, advances are still needed to decrease the interstage mortality, as
well as a larger number of cases to statistically prove the benefits of this
technique.</p><p>Therefore, more efforts should be made to improve the current outcomes of this type
of palliation and, ultimately, the prognosis of this subset of patients. Currently,
after three years of experience, we have developed a less invasive technique which
precludes the use of contrast media, which we hope will positively reflect on the

It can gradually differentiate into many kinds of mammary gland cells after delivery and undergo many rounds of proliferation and apoptosis during the life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In addition to the role of hormones, the local tissue microenvironment also plays a key role in the fate of MPCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The maintenance and differentiation of MPCs can be achieved by perceiving signals from the components of extracellular matrix (ECM). For example, investigators have discovered that laminin I could maintain MPCs in a quiescent state and MPCs could differentiate into basal cells by the expression of the P-cadherin in the ECM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">There is increasing evidence that natural microenvironment has become one of the key factors affecting cell behavior and function in developmental, physiological, and pathological processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Some researchers have transplanted the mammary epithelium into the salivary gland mesenchyme, resulting in a structure similar to the salivary gland epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. When co-cultured with mammary mesenchyme, the salivary epithelium could develop a mammary gland-like ductal tree which could even respond to hormonal stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Other research has transplanted sweat gland (SG) progenitor cells into the mammary glands of lactating mice and found that they expressed milk proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These previous experiments demonstrated the dominance of the mammary niche over the phenotype of cells from other tissues; while investigations involving MPCs reprogramming to regenerate foreign tissues are seldom reported.</p><p id="Par21">The artificial microenvironment, which imitates natural microenvironment <italic>in vitro</italic>, has recently emerged as a significant field in regenerative medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It plays a vital role in tissue regeneration <italic>in vitro</italic>, especially those tissues or organs that cannot be completely regenerated after injury. A crucial aspect of the cell-laden artificial microenvironment is that the bioink must be cytocompatible, which restricts the choice of materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Researchers have so far designed and manufactured many types of artificial microenvironments using multiple hydrogels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, the complexity of natural microenvironment cannot be completely replaced only by those materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Interactions between cells and ECM are so complicated that a tissue-specific microenvironment is necessary to sustain the cells regeneration <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Therefore, we use gelatin-alginate hydrogels which have good cell compatibility combined with the components from mouse SG-ECM proteins to fabricate a tailored bioink. At present, the mainstream three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting approach is used to build a 3D construct which can imitate the natural 3D microenvironment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A large number of our previous studies prove that 3D bioprinted scaffolds benefit SG regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Here, we creatively produce an artificial SG microenvironment via combining the advantages of our tailored bioink and 3D bioprinting approach to research the regeneration of SG cells <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p id="Par22">Although both the mammary glands and SG originate from epidermal progenitor cells, their functions are quite different. Mature mammary glands have the function of secreting milk to feed offspring while SG can perspire to maintain the homeostasis by regulating body temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. That led to the question of whether or not the 3D bioprinted SG microenvironment has the ability to redirect the differentiation of MPCs. Two-dimensional (2D) cell culture systems could not offer an ideal setup to study highly branched cells such as glandular cells. In 2D cultures, the growth of SG cells is unrealistically flattened, limiting the acquisition of full cellular functionality, and the cellular microenvironment is poorly modeled. In this work, we have cultured MPCs in the 3D bioprinted SG microenvironment and results of immunofluorescence and quantitative real-time PCR analysis have shown that induced MPCs express the functional protein marker of luminal epithelial cells of SG.</p><p id="Par23">The development of SG is regulated by a relay of signals initiated by Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin with subsequent participation of EDA/EDAR/NF-&#x003ba;b and Shh pathways. The induction of SG is controlled by Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin and duct formation involves EDA/EDAR/NF-&#x003ba;b. Shh is downstream of Eda and regulates final secretory region formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. But Shh signaling pathway does not participate in the development of MPCs morphology and expression of function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In this study, the Shh pathway was detected and found to be correlated with the redirection of MPCs to SG cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Isolation and identification of MPCs</title><p id="Par24">Pregnant day 12&#x02013;14 (P12&#x02013;14) C57BL/6 mice were purchased from SPF Biotechnology Co., Ltd.

To study whether the 3D bioprinted SG microenvironments could induce the differentiation of MPCs into SG cells, we have first screened the specifically expressed markers of SG cells which are not expressed in mammary gland cells. The sodium/potassium channel protein ATP1a1 has been demonstrated as the functional marker of mouse SG while not expressed in mammary glands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Immunofluorescence assay showed consistent results, ATP1a1 displayed the greatest differential expression between SG cells and MPCs (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1).

Here, we show that MPCs can be induced and mainly differentiate into SG cells at both morphological and functional level. Quantitative RT-PCR combined with immunofluorescence analysis of keratin expression demonstrates that the 3D bioprinted SG microenvironment we created is more conducive to promoting the differentiation of MPCs into luminal epithelial cells of SG. Additionally, the Shh signaling pathway was involved in the induction process. These results strongly suggest the importance of the engineered microenvironment for redirecting differentiation of MPCs to regenerate foreign tissues.</p><p id="Par39">Given the same origins of mammary gland cells and SG cells, they express plenty of similar keratins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Based on this, the functional protein ATP1a1 of SG cells was screened at the differential protein between the two cells, as well as ER-&#x003b1; which was specifically expressed in the mammary gland cells. Previous researches and our experimental data have shed light on that mouse MPCs expressed both K14 and K19, but we detected that induced MPCs in 3D bioprinted SG microenvironment expressed K8, K19, and ATP1a1, while we did not detect these cells colocalizing with K14 expression. These data prove that MPCs mainly differentiated into luminal epithelial cells of SG. Researchers have verified that the signaling pathway involved in SG development. It mainly includes Wnt, Eda, NF-&#x003ba;b, and Shh signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. To gain further insight into the mechanism of reprogramming, we examine which signaling pathways are highly expressed during induction of MPCs in 3D bioprinted SG microenvironment and find that Shh signaling pathway has a high expression at the third day of culture. Considering that the Shh signaling pathway does not exist in mature mammary glands but in SG, we use it as a screened pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. As the result shows, the expression of ATP1a1 and K8 of cells cultured in 3D bioprinted SG microenvironment is significantly depressed after being handled with the inhibitor of Shh signaling pathway, which adds to the evidence that reprogramming of MPCs into SG cells is related to Shh signaling pathway.</p><p id="Par40">The engineered SG microenvironment we create using gelatin-alginate hydrogels and the components from mouse SG-ECM proteins through 3D bioprinting approach in our study has been demonstrated in previous articles that it was capable of inducing epidermal progenitor cells into SG cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. It is capable of sustaining stem cells with long-term survival and differentiation because of the high cell compatibility and cell viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. To fabricate a more tissue-specific artificial microenvironment for reprogramming MPCs into SG cells, the mouse SG-ECM proteins which are demonstrated that no residual SG cells in it are added into the tailored bioink (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2a). To date, engineering artificial microenvironment utilizing 3D bioprinting approach is being successfully used in many researches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. It can provide a 3D structure which has a high similarity to the natural microenvironment. To shed light on this question, we test that mouse SG-ECM proteins are unable to induce MPCs into SG cells in a 2D cultured environment (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S3). Recent work has shed light on that the stiffness of ECM microenvironment can affect cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. ECM microenvironment with low stiffness promotes differentiation to the luminal epithelial cells by inhibiting the expression of RhoA signaling pathway, whereas MPCs more easily differentiate into myoepithelial cells in hard matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Therefore, we speculated that the stiffness of 3D bioprinted SG microenvironment we created in this study is more conducive to promoting the differentiation of MPCs into luminal epithelial cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par41">Taken together, the study provides clear evidence for the ability of differentiated mouse MPCs to regenerate SG cells by engineered SG microenvironment fabricated by gelatin-alginate hydrogels and mouse SG-ECM proteins through 3D bioprinting approach <italic>in vitro</italic>.

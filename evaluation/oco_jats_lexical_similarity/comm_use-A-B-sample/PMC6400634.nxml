They may have specific benefit for primary care, as depression is often managed in this setting. However, little is known about attitudes and barriers among GPs towards e-mental health interventions for depression.</p></sec><sec><title>Aim</title><p>This study aimed to assess attitudes, knowledge, use, and barriers for depression-focused e-mental health among GPs across the UK.</p></sec><sec><title>Design and setting</title><p>An online survey of self-selecting GPs in the UK conducted over a 10-day period in December 2017.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p>The survey consisted of 13 multiple choice questions posted on the Doctors.net.uk (DNUK) website.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In all, 1044 responses were included; 72% of GPs reported using at least one type of e-mental health intervention for depression. Overall, GPs reported that e-mental health interventions are most effective when delivered in a guided way, rather than in an unguided manner. In addition, 92% of GPs reported that neither they nor their colleagues received e-mental health training.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A moderate number of GPs use e-mental health for depression in their services, and report it is likely that its use will increase. There is a gap in training and awareness of effective interventions. GPs consider guided e-mental health interventions to be most effective, in contrast to the unguided way it is mostly offered in primary care.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>depression</kwd><kwd>general practice</kwd><kwd>mental health</kwd><kwd>primary health care</kwd><kwd>technological innovations</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide, the largest contributor to non-fatal health loss globally,<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and is associated with an increased risk of suicide.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In England, it is estimated that 1.5 million people will have depression by 2026, resulting in societal costs of &#x000a3;12.2 billion a year to health care and social services, and in lost employment.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>In the UK, individuals with depression may receive treatment in primary care or be referred on to secondary or specialist services. For depression, GPs in England can refer on to an Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT)<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> service. IAPT services, launched in 2008, aim to increase access to evidence-based treatments for anxiety and depression.<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Demand for IAPT services has increased over recent years, with referrals rising by 43% between 2012&#x02013;2013 and 2014&#x02013;2015, to a total of 1.2 million.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Rising demand for services suggests that primary care will continue to be an increasingly major provider of mental health treatment for depression. Mental health problems have been cited as the second most common reason for primary care consultations in the UK, and GPs have reported spending an average of 30% of their time on mental health problems.<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Given increased pressure on services in the UK, it is important to explore new methods of managing depression that are effective for patients, and cost-effective for services. One such avenue is the use of electronic mental health (e-mental health) interventions. In England, the NHS has increasingly highlighted e-mental health in policy publications such as the <italic>Five Year Forward View for Mental Health</italic>,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> which includes technology-focused strategies to improve care.</p><p>Over the past decade, e-mental health interventions for depression have been used to expand support to a broader population.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> These interventions can be guided (supported by a therapist), or unguided (completed by the patient independently without therapist support). Computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (cCBT), in particular, can be a cost-effective approach, with meta-analyses indicating moderate effects on depression symptoms (severity measure for depression [SMD] = &#x02212;0.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] = &#x02212;0.57 to &#x02212;0.12).<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> cCBT has been recommended in guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for treatment of mild to moderate depression symptoms.<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><boxed-text position="float"><sec><title>How this fits in</title><p>Previous research has shown that guided e-mental health interventions may be effective for prevention, treatment, and management of depression. Little is known about the extent to which these tools are used in primary care in the UK, or about how GPs feel about such tools. Understanding GP knowledge and attitudes towards the use of e-mental health interventions will improve delivery of evidence-based e-mental health interventions for depression in primary care.</p></sec></boxed-text><p>Studies show that the way in which e-mental health interventions are delivered may play a role in their impact. Evidence from a large UK randomised controlled study (REEACT1) found no additional benefit of offering unguided cCBT (with minimal telephone support) over usual GP care over the course of 12 months.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Guided e-health interventions, however, appear to be more effective, and are associated with higher treatment adherence and efficacy.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>Despite ongoing research into effectiveness, little is known about the uptake of such interventions and the attitudes of UK professionals towards their implementation.

Barriers included: infrastructure requirements; capacity; privacy concerns; awareness; availability of services; confidence to prescribe e-mental health interventions; willingness of patients; clinical risk; patient familiarity with and access to technology; uncertainty about the evidence base; medicolegal responsibility; and costs of implementation.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>A strength of the study was its large sample size, which was broadly representative of the regional and age distribution of GPs. In addition, to the authors&#x02019; knowledge, this is the first survey of its kind conducted on e-mental health in the UK. But the study is limited by its self-selecting design in two ways. First, only GPs on DNUK were able to access the survey. Second, only 1260 of 9928 active users accessed it. This implies that the survey may not be representative of the views of all UK GPs, which affects the generalisability of these findings. However, individuals active on DNUK and who chose to complete the survey may have been more engaged with technology, and therefore more open to, or aware of, current e-mental health interventions.</p><p>Furthermore, due to the online survey structure, items had existing pre-defined responses. Although participants were offered free-text response options, these were not widely completed and may have limited the responses more than a qualitative approach would have done.</p><p>Additionally, due to the range of terms currently used in the field (for example, e-mental health, e-technologies, mHealth, digital, and so on), participants may have misunderstood some items, potentially biasing responses. It is recommended that future studies should not assume awareness of the range of interventions, and that definitions are provided where possible.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with existing literature</title><p>All barriers listed in the survey were seen by GPs as &#x02018;somewhat significant&#x02019;, including infrastructure requirements, capacity, confidence to prescribe e-mental health interventions, willingness of patients, and uncertainty about the evidence base. This mirrors the findings from a previous survey conducted across a range of countries and stakeholders, which found that perceived barriers included concern about capacity for implementation, an expectation of negative attitudes from practitioners and patients, and concerns about effectiveness.<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> However, although the same survey found cost-effectiveness to be the most significant perceived advantage of e-mental health technology, cost was cited as a &#x02018;somewhat significant&#x02019; barrier by most GPs in the current study. This suggests that although there are shared challenges to implementing e-mental health interventions across stakeholders and countries, some barriers may be unique to specific settings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Implications for research and practice</title><p>The reported lack of awareness of current e-mental health interventions may be due in part to the limited amount of training and resources tailored to e-mental health interventions in primary care. Although e-learning modules for GPs are available,<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> they focus on education about mental health rather than use of e-mental health interventions. As a result, it can prove challenging for GPs to decide which interventions to recommend and how to deliver them effectively. Thus, there may be a need for a clinical curriculum on e-mental health, alongside further training for existing staff, including GPs, nurses, assistants, and other healthcare professionals.</p><p>Such programmes should focus on specific audiences to ensure information is relevant to staff in a climate of increased pressure on services. A valuable first step might be to signpost to current initiatives like the NHS digital app library.<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Allowing other staff, such as trained nurses or lay counsellors, to support in the guidance of e-mental health interventions may also aid in alleviating barriers around capacity to implement interventions. However, further evaluation of effective models of guidance is required.</p><p>There is also a need for further evaluation of the relative effectiveness of different e-mental health interventions. This will aid in a greater understanding of what works in primary care and assist GPs and affiliated health staff in making informed decisions about appropriate tools to prescribe. This is supported by the rating of &#x02018;concerns about the evidence base&#x02019; as a significant barrier by a large proportion of GPs in this survey.</p><p>It is recommended that future training for GPs captures this complexity, and that future research addresses concerns regarding implementation and effectiveness. This will ultimately improve support for prevention and treatment of depression in primary care.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge Medeconnect for their support in running the survey, as well as the entire eMEN consortium for their support and input.</p></ack><notes><sec><title>Funding</title><p>The current study was funded by the Interreg North West Europe Programme which invested in the eMEN project, an EU-wide platform for e-mental health innovation and implementation formed by private and public partners in North West Europe.<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Ethical approval</title><p>Not applicable.</p></sec><sec><title>Provenance</title><p>Freely submitted; externally peer reviewed.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Coauthor Claudi LH Bockting (CLHB) is coeditor of PLoS One and receives no honorarium for this role.

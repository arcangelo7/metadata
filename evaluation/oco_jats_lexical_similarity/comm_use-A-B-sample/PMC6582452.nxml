Interviews (<italic>n</italic> = 33) were conducted with healthcare staff and next of kin involved in the admission to a large English hospital of a patient who subsequently died there within 3 days of admission (a &#x02018;case-patient&#x02019;).</p><boxed-text position="float"><sec><title>How this fits in</title><p>It is known that dying at home is an end-of-life care policy priority, with reducing end-of-life hospital admissions targeted in end-of-life care improvement measures. Many people currently die in hospital. Understanding why deaths occur in hospital rather than at home is underexplored but is often assumed to be associated with problems in care provision. This study shows that home-based end-of-life care can be precarious and an absence of nursing care or family support may facilitate hospital admission; deaths in hospitals can occur where home is not considered a suitable place of care and death, and offers benefits to patients, family carers, and staff.</p></sec></boxed-text><p>Interviewees included community healthcare staff (GPs, a community specialist nurse, and ambulance staff) hospital staff, and the case-patients&#x02019; next of kin. This study centres on the accounts of interviewees involved in the care of a case-patient who had been admitted to hospital from home. Additionally, the accounts of interviewees involved in the admission of case-patients from other community settings have been included as they usefully reflected on other patients admitted from home.

Healthcare staff interviews addressed the participants&#x02019; involvement in the case-patients&#x02019; admission, their views on the reasons for the admission, and end-of-life admissions generally. These interviews were conducted within a month of the interviewee&#x02019;s involvement in the case-patient&#x02019;s care, lasted approximately 30 minutes, and occurred at the participants&#x02019; place of work or nearby. Next-of-kin interviews considered the case-patient&#x02019;s care in the last months before death, including their involvement in care provision. These interviews took place 4&#x02013;7 months after the case-patient&#x02019;s death, lasted approximately 1 hour, and occurred at their home.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Analysis</title><p>Interviews with staff and next of kin provided highly detailed accounts of the circumstances that led to the hospital admission of case-patients and for staff interviewees, similar patients they had cared for previously. Interviews were audiorecorded and professionally transcribed verbatim. The transcripts were analysed thematically to understand the reasons that facilitated admission to hospital. Transcripts were coded by hand and then using the software NVivo (version 10), with sections of the text tagged using both a priori and emergent data categories. Codes were then sorted and charted to assess both the breadth and depth of data. Data were synthesised to understand both the individual case-patients&#x02019; admission, and the admissions collectively, with synthesis aided by reference to both end-of-life care and sociological literature.

The desirability of death at home was conceptualised using ideas of familiarity, comfort, and the presence of loved ones, as well as the fulfilment of perceived patient preferences about place of death. Even where staff articulated practical difficulties in supporting a patient&#x02019;s death to occur at home, it was typical to concurrently recognise the desirability of patients dying at home:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;Most people want to die at home right? Surrounded by, you know, their friends, family and everything else.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(GP, 4, 5)</attrib></disp-quote>
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;I think people should be able to die at home. Most elderly and terminal patients do not want to die outside their home but I think there is a general fear and lack of confidence by relatives etc, and I don&#x02019;t think necessarily there would be resources to manage that. So I think if the resources were in place to help support the family then I do think that would be a good option.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(GP, 10, 9)</attrib></disp-quote></p></sec><sec><title>Importance of formal care provision</title><p>Despite the aspiration for home-based end-of-life care, the community was not always a viable or a desirable place of care for patients according to interviewees. A significant factor in this negative assessment of home was the absence of sufficient domiciliary care to address a patient&#x02019;s needs. For patients deemed to be in that situation, the utility of hospital as a care provider was recognised by interviewees. Community staff described facilitating admissions to ensure patients received appropriate care:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;I think the thing that we struggle with in the community is the resources to manage a death, sometimes it can be quite difficult for the district nurses with short notice depending on what else is on their caseload. Things like hospice, it depends on bed availability and so it can be quite frustrating, you know what you want to do or you know how you want to manage it and sometimes people do have, you know difficult symptoms that we have to refer to hospice, if they don&#x02019;t have a bed then sometimes it becomes difficult because what do you do? You&#x02019;re kind of caught between a rock and a hard place really.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(GP, 15, 7)</attrib></disp-quote></p></sec><sec><title>Availability and timeliness of nursing provision</title><p>Community nursing was well regarded by interviewees, particularly GPs. However, the limited availability of this care, particularly at short notice, was a significant problem. Staff described the challenge of maintaining patients at home where the patients&#x02019; care needs had escalated and additional care was required sooner than care could be organised or was available. This was particularly applicable when a patient&#x02019;s condition had deteriorated rapidly or they were experiencing unanticipated symptoms. In these circumstances, hospital care was sought:
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;I wondered about perhaps keeping</italic> [the case-patient] <italic>at home with some district nurse support</italic> [...], <italic>unfortunately when I rang the district nurses they were very busy with</italic> [a] <italic>cancer patient and there wasn&#x02019;t a district nurse available to come and help, so I had a chat to the patient and</italic> [their spouse] <italic>and said, &#x0201c;what do you feel about being admitted?&#x0201d;, and</italic> [the case-patient] <italic>wasn&#x02019;t that keen to go up</italic> [to the hospital], [their spouse] <italic>was quite keen for</italic> [them] <italic>to be looked after,</italic> [the spouse] <italic>was struggling.&#x02019;</italic></p><attrib>(GP, 1, 2)</attrib></disp-quote></p></sec><sec><title>Community care was supplemented by family care</title><p>Problems in domiciliary end-of-life care were also associated with family care provision, especially for patients resident at home. These patients often received personal care from spouses and adult children who supported their day-to-day living and healthcare needs. Where patients required more care than family members could provide, hospital admission was often sought both by community staff and family members. Staff descriptions of these admissions typically involved negative portrayals of family members as being unwilling to provide terminal care, or more charitably, as being unprepared for the patient&#x02019;s death:
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;I felt that the main problem was that the family weren&#x02019;t able to manage</italic> [the case-patient&#x02019;s] <italic>condition at home.

In the next section, the demands on family carers&#x02019; time, physicality, and experience are examined in relation to end-of-life hospital admissions.</p></sec><sec><title>Experience to provide care</title><p>Family care provision at home could be compromised by the limited experience some family carers had of death and end-of-life care. For healthcare staff, na&#x000ef;ve family carer expectations of the dying process were thought to hinder the likelihood of death at home, as unfamiliar but typical end-of-life care symptoms were reported to lead family carers to seek reassurance and care. Consequently, hospital admissions were thought to occur, either directly, as carers sought help from ambulance or out-of-hours services, or indirectly, if they requested additional help that could realistically only be fulfilled in hospital:
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;</italic> [...] <italic>So it does seem that we had talked about end-of-life care but we probably didn&#x02019;t talk about preferred place of care or maybe the family weren&#x02019;t prepared well enough for the last stages of</italic> [the case-patient&#x02019;s] <italic>dying to manage with the support that we have.&#x02019;</italic></p><attrib>(Ward doctor, 14, 1)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>For family carers, inexperience was often expressed as concern about the quality of their care provision, particularly compared to professional carers. While this was not cited by family carers as a reason for admission &#x02014; family carers who had facilitated case-patient admissions said they did so to access necessary medical support &#x02014; they acknowledged the hospital to be a place for professional attention and a place where their relative would receive appropriate care:
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;I was pleased</italic> [they] <italic>died in hospital, because I always used to think &#x0201c;If you&#x02019;re ill, hospital is the best place to be, because there you can have all the correct attention and everything that you want&#x0201d;.

The consequences of this to the family carer was infrequently recognised by the family carer themselves, who typically dismissed their own care provision as just part of their family role. However, providing care could have negative effects on the family carer&#x02019;s wellbeing, and healthcare staff described how a patient&#x02019;s care need could exceed the family carer&#x02019;s capacity to provide care. In these instances, additional care was often recognised to be necessary, whether sought from hospital providers or elsewhere:
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;I don&#x02019;t think</italic> [the family] <italic>understood how much work it would be</italic> [caring for the case-patient].

This could make family care provision difficult, particularly if a carer was a frail older individual and the patients&#x02019; health had deteriorated such that they required substantial hands-on support. In these instances, both community and hospital interviewees recognised that the continued maintenance of patients at home was impractical without additional support.

Insufficient available nursing provision and family carers who had exceeded their capacity to care countered the desirability of home as a place to deliver end-of-life care. These circumstances often caused GPs, together with family carers and other healthcare staff to seek care for patients through hospital admissions.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This article has explored the consequences of insufficient community-based care as a precursor to end-of-life hospital admissions. This research usefully contributes to the limited evidence base on end-of-life hospital admissions. In a policy and clinical context where the desirability of dying at home is presumed, the present findings also add insight to the practicalities of home-based end-of-life care.</p><p>The findings of this study are from an in-depth qualitative study of 33 healthcare professionals and next of kin involved in the admission to one English hospital of nine patients close to the end of life. The extent to which interviewee accounts of the case-patients&#x02019;, and similar patients&#x02019;, community-based care, and the reasons for their hospital admission, can be extrapolated to end-of-life care in general is therefore limited. For instance, it is likely that some other patients with problems in the provision of professional or family care would continue to remain at home and not seek hospital care. However, the challenges faced by healthcare staff and family carers in providing end-of-life care accords with existing research, as outlined later on, and contributes to an understanding of why admissions occur.</p><p>Formal care provision that occurs at the interface of health and social care, such as supporting personal hygiene, or eating and drinking, has not been addressed in this article. This care is pertinent to understanding how end-of-life care can be facilitated at home,<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> and paid carers were known to have supported some of the case-patients. Interviewing these carers was outside the study scope, and their role was not sufficiently elaborated by other interviewees to be considered.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with existing literature</title><p>The limited availability and capacity of domiciliary nursing care was cited as a reason why interviewees instigated hospital admissions for patients close to the end of life. The challenge for GPs in arranging community nursing end-of-life care is also reported in a UK-wide survey,<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and seems likely to be due to the restricted capacity of community nursing, where rising demand for services coincides with staff shortages.<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Internationally, the importance of community-based end-of-life care provision for facilitating death at home accords with review evidence, which identifies receipt of community-based nursing, home palliative care, and GP home visits as key factors.<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p><p>The importance of family care provision in facilitating death at home is well-established.<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> The present research shows that where lay care is recognised to be no longer tenable, healthcare providers may seek hospital care for patients, supporting GP accounts about the reasons for end-of-life admissions<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and pejorative rhetoric about family carers.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> However, it would be inaccurate to assert on the basis of this that problems in lay care provision instigate these admissions,<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> without acknowledging simultaneously the contribution of family care provision in maintaining patients at home. Interviewees demonstrated that family members delivering hands-on care provided vital support, supplementing professional care provision.<xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Therefore, it is plausible that hands-on care from family members can defer admission to hospital for some patients while resident at home. This is pertinent given the context of lay care provision: family carers were understood to be often ill-prepared for their role<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> with often substantial, if typical, psychological<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> and physical<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> demands made of them, particularly for those with limited mobility such as frail older people. It seems likely therefore that family carers&#x02019; ability to sustain their care provision, and prevent hospital admissions, is compromised without supplementary support.<xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></p><p>Facilitating end-of-life care at home was important for professional carers, who echoed prevalent notions about the desirability of death at home.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> However, interviewees also recognised that the safety of end-of-life care at home could be compromised.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Where the cause of this could not be addressed adequately, healthcare staff and family carers sought care for the patients elsewhere. While hospice and residential nursing homes were considered, challenges in accessing these institutions at short notice meant hospital care was prioritised<xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> highlighting the importance of hospital as a provider for end-of-life care.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Implications for research and practice</title><p>The present analysis was informed by a sociological interest in dying at home, focusing on the physical and technical infrastructure of home and hospital, the skills of lay carers and professionals, and the way dying is understood by those involved.<xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> This perspective exposed the vulnerability of home care for some patients, which can be dependent on stretched professional and lay provision, and builds on over a decade of sociological scholarship on the role of home as a place of care.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>The case-patients&#x02019; hospital admissions demonstrate the difficulty of providing and maintaining care at home. The authors&#x02019; findings challenge the prevalent discourse that home is an inherently better place to receive end-of-life care than hospital and highlight the dissonance between policy rhetoric and the everyday reality of caring for patients close to the end of life. The present research suggests that if policy and practice maintain an emphasis on facilitating deaths at home, there must also be a concurrent focus on ensuring that patients can die there safely. Identifying how best to achieve this will require further research, and is likely to require investment to ensure that community nursing provision is adequately staffed, responsive, and available throughout the day and night.<xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Supplementing this essential provision with rapid and reliable specialist clinical services that offer support for patients at home for extended periods of time, such as hospice at home and Marie Curie nursing services, would also be pertinent.<xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> To facilitate care delivery, primary care clinicians must be supported by adequate information-sharing practices,<xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> and be confident in delivering palliative and end-of-life care.<xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> Family carers must also be supported, including greater recognition of their needs.<xref rid="b49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> Pejorative assessments of the association between family care and end-of-life hospital admissions obscures the significant undertaking of lay carers to support patients at home. Future research could productively address how families persist in providing care, and how GPs and others can best support them.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the participants and those involved in the set-up and running of the study.</p></ack><notes><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This study presents independent research part funded by the National Institute for Health Research Collaborations for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (NIHR CLAHRC) Cambridge and Peterborough (grant number: RG55908), and NIHR CLAHRC East of England (grant number: RG74481).

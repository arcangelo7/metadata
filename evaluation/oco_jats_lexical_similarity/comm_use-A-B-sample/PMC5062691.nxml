are useful guides to new approaches towards improving clinical and surgical
treatments, even though transposition is rarely perfect and often unacceptable. It
is the author's experience after a long life in this field of research that many of
the procedures routinely used in the evaluation and treatment of shock stem from
work initially performed in the framework of carefully experiments. This review
intends to cover reports from experimental models relating to the effects of shock
and trauma upon the cardiovascular system published during a five-year period which
ended on December 31, 2014. I have found that data published during these five years
cover some classic areas of investigation (e.g., hemorrhagic shock, aortic
occlusion, trauma, traumatic brain injury and sepsis), but also a number of new
lines, such as endothelial integrity and vascular reactivity. The concept behind
this critical review is to examine these contributions and the manner in which they
contribute to our contemporary understanding of shock. I was also glad to note that
hypertonic resuscitation, to which I contributed during my active research life, is
still a subject of interest.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>Articles were selected from pubmed.gov using the following search syntax: (shock) AND
(trauma) AND (animal model) AND (cardiovascular) AND
("2010/01/01"[PDat]: "2015/12/31"[PDat]). The search
yielded 88 articles; the abstracts were subsequently examined manually, leading to a
final collection of 55 entries. A careful examination of the texts further reduced
this number to 43; four other articles<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> published
previously to the time window covered in this review period are cited in order to
clarify items discussed herein<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. The 43 contemporary articles were then divided into
themes and each theme is subsequently narrated and discussed conjointly.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><p>Classic physiological characteristics of shock were studied in four reports. Jonker
et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> examined
the impact of hypovolemic shock on the aortic diameter in a porcine model to
determine its implications for the endovascular management of hypovolemic patients
with traumatic thoracic aortic injury. The aortic diameter was significantly
decreased during blood loss. This very basic anatomical/physiological study may have
implications for thoracic endovascular aortic repair because endografts should
either be made oversize, or additional imaging after fluid resuscitation may be
required for the production of an adequate graft. Transcapillary refill was
evaluated in dogs submitted to uncontrolled hemorrhage by Sallum et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> I am a
co-author of this paper and we found that rebleeding occurred irrespective of
whether the condition was treated with isotonic or hypertonic saline. However, as
might be expected from some strictly physical considerations, hypertonic saline
treatment induced transcapillary refill whereas isotonic saline resuscitation led to
capillary extravasation. This was one piece of research undertaken at the Heart
Institute Research Division in response to claims that hypertonic saline
resuscitation should be avoided due to its capacity to increase
bleeding<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.
Chao et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>
studied temporary vascular shunts, because the procedure is frequently relied upon
in current military scenarios: pigs were submitted to 40% of blood loss and the
study aimed at establishing the time to failure of short proximally placed vascular
shunts and to examine histological changes in shunted arteries. These shunts
remained functional for at least 48-72 hours. This piece of information may aid in
the establishment of combat and mass disaster evacuation patterns. Pasupuleti et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>
examined the effects of beta-1 blockers in a rat model of lung contusion and
hemorrhagic shock; they claim that its use was ineffective in protecting the bone
marrow cellularity. Even though this is a negative result and I feel that its
presence here is justified in order to prevent would-be researchers from repeating
it.</p><sec><title>Hemorrhage</title><p>The most frequently reported studies refer to animal models in which a single
hemorrhagic stroke was imposed upon the experimental model.</p></sec><sec><title>Endothelial integrity and protection</title><p>The endothelium is the first line of defense of end-organs against external
aggression. Research around this theme indicates that the deleterious effects of
hemorrhagic shock can be prevented through endothelial protection. Causey et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>
reports on data obtained from experiments in swine, in which a supraceliac cross
clamp was applied simultaneously with a hemorrhagic stroke; valproic acid was
administered simultaneously. Valproic acid reduced resuscitative requirements,
and led to improved hemodynamics; evaluation of gene expression for specific
growth factors showed that the treatment also minimized pathologic endothelial
cell dysfunction through the expression of genes regulating endothelial
transforming growth factors. They conclude that these genes were involved in the
preservation of endothelial function, which was enhanced by valproic acid. In a
second study<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>, using a similar model, Causey et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> formulated a concept
that valproic acid confers relevant metabolic, cardiovascular and pathologic
protection to individuals submitted to hemorrhagic hypotension. Still on the
theme of valproic acid, Dekker et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> used a swine model in which traumatic
brain injury combined with hemorrhage was treated with fresh frozen plasma and
valproic acid. In this clinically relevant large animal model of combined brain
trauma and hemorrhage, the addition of valproic acid to fresh frozen plasma
resulted in an early upregulation of platelet activation in the circulation and
in the brain. I definitely believe that this is a theme that encourages future
research. Endothelial integrity is the object of a study by Torres et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>,
who evaluated the effects of hetastarch, lactated Ringer's or fresh frozen
plasma on endothelial glycocalyx, venular blood flow and coagulation in
hemorrhaged rats. I believe it is useful to interrupt the narrative of the
Torres et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> findings with a note on glycocalyx: this is a
glycoprotein-polysaccharide covering endothelial cell membranes which acts as an
identifier capable of distinguishing between its own healthy cells, transplanted
tissues, diseased cells, or invading organisms. Torres et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> claim that their
findings support the concept of cardiovascular and microvascular stabilization
by infused fresh frozen plasma, in which the increase in microvascular perfusion
associated with restored endothelial glycocalyx is essential for an optimal
resuscitation strategy. The concept of glycocalyx integrity is further discussed
in a situation of traumatic brain injury. Using a rat model, Jepsen et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>
examined the hypothesis that severe isolated traumatic brain injury causes
shedding of endothelial glycocalyx as a consequence of the injury, and that this
shedding is enhanced by valproic acid, which diminished the size of the brain
lesion caused by the injury. Thus, rather paradoxically, it appears that the
shedding of glycocalyx may be beneficial to the response of the brain to trauma.
More research is clearly required to resolve these antagonistic reports. The
role of endothelial integrity is also the object of a study by Johnson et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>,
who report that, in a rat model of severe hemorrhage, arginase, an enzyme that
competes for l-arginine with nitric oxide synthase, plays an essential role in
the development of endothelial dysfunction in resistance vessels. In contrast,
the ministration of exogenous nitric oxide to hamsters submitted to hemorrhagic
shock by Nachuraju et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> preserved microvascular perfusion and reduced
hemorrhagic shock sequelae. The relevance, stability, and efficacy of exogenous,
NO therapy in the form of NO-nanoparticles will potentially facilitate its
intended use in trauma situations. Pati et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> showed that the protective effects of
fresh frozen plasma on endothelial permeability after hemorrhagic shock is time
dependent and diminishes from day 1 to day 5 after the plasma is thawed. Deitch
et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>
tested the hypothesis that trauma and hemorrhage are capable of inducing
erythrocyte-endothelial adhesion. They show that erythrocytes obtained from rats
subjected to trauma-hemorrhage can be used to determine the role of endothelial
receptors in the increased adhesive response. It is known that red blood cells
normally express the CD36 adhesion molecule, which normally binds to endothelial
cell receptors. In conditions of trauma-hemorrhage mesenteric lymph carries gut
derived factors, which induce enhanced CD36 expression. These findings may
explain the microvascular dysfunction occurring after trauma-hemorrhagic shock,
sepsis, and other stress states.</p></sec><sec><title>Vascular reactivity</title><p>Vascular reactivity is an obviously significant element in the natural history of
shock and has been frequently examined during this period. Zhu et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>
describe the role of adenosine A2A receptors in organ specific vascular
reactivity following hemorrhagic shock in rats. They studied the thoracic aorta,
and samples of femoral, renal, superior mesenteric, pulmonary and middle
cerebral arteries. Interestingly, the reactivity of the femoral, mesenteric,
renal and middle cerebral arteries increased during early shock and decreased
thereafter, whereas that of aorta end pulmonary artery decreased throughout the
period. The interesting point is that the rate of loss of vascular reactivity in
the different vessels was negatively correlated with adenosine A2A receptors
expression levels in normal and shock conditions. They conclude that the
expression of these receptors may have beneficial effects on shock by improving
vascular reactivity and hemodynamic parameters. The problem of vascular
reactivity was also studied by Yang et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>, who claim that mitogenactivated
protein kinases are essential for the regulation of mesenteric arteries
following shock. </p><p>Xu et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>
have likewise connected protein Kinase C to hemorrhagic shock; they reported
experiments performed in superior mesenteric arteries of rats which show that
the kinase is involved in the regulation of calcium sensitivity after
hemorrhagic shock; the use of antagonists of this signaling molecule decrease
and aggravate calcium desensitization induced by shock. In the same line, Hu et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>
report on the effect of the BK Ca<sup>++</sup> activated potassium channel
activator NS1619 against shock induced vascular hyporeactivity. They found that
if rats were pretreated with the channel molecule, then submitted to hemorrhagic
shock, their 72 hours survival rate was increased and suggest the BK
Ca<sup>++</sup> channel may be a target for the treatment of shock induced
vascular hyporeactivity. This is probably a line of research that may add
essential tools for the treatment of the more pernicious shock conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Mesenteric lymph and shock</title><p>Shock has been long recognized as an essential factor in the breakdown of the
gut-blood defense barrier. It would thus be obvious to expect that mesenteric
lymph might be an essential culprit in the development of organ dysfunction in
this condition. In a previous study, Sambol et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> had noted that the
myocardial dysfunction which follows trauma and/or hemorrhage can be prevented
by mesenteric lymph duct ligation; in their present study<sup>[<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> they show that
mesenteric lymph collected from rats submitted to trauma plus hemorrhage and
applied to isolated cardiac myocytes induced an immediate increase in the
amplitude of cell shortening followed by a complete block of contraction,
concomitant with a similar dual positive - negative effect on Ca<sup>++</sup>
transients. It thus appears that T/HS lymph directly causes negative inotropic
effects on the myocardium and that lymph from trauma/hemorrhaged rats induced
changes in myocyte function that are likely to contribute to the development of
myocardial dysfunction. I see this as a classic type of evidence that was first
developed as the postulate on chemical mediation proposed in 1934 by Nobel
laureate Sir Henry Dale<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. Morishita et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> studied the effects of
post-hemorrhagic shock mesenteric lymph collected from rats on isolated human
neutrophils and conclude that this lymph contains biologically active lipids,
which may be involved in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury and/or
multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome. More recently, Zhao et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup>
induced shock in rats by superior mesenteric artery occlusion and studied the
effect of mesenteric lymph reperfusion. The mesenteric lymph duct was occluded
for one hour. The occlusion induced increased levels of the
endotoxin-lipopolysaccharide receptor, of the lipopolysaccharide-binding
protein, of the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and of tumor necrosis
factor-&#x003b1;. Concurrently, mesenteric lymph reperfusion after superior
mesenteric artery occlusion further aggravated these deleterious effects. Thus,
lymph reperfusion exacerbated the endotoxin translocation in brain; thereby an
increased inflammatory response occurred, suggesting that the intestinal lymph
pathway plays an important role in the brain injury after superior mesenteric
artery occlusion shock.</p></sec><sec><title>Aortic occlusion</title><p>Two papers analyzed the potential therapeutic effect of aortic occlusion after
severe blood loss. Avaro et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> described the feasibility of aortic balloon
catheter occlusion in intra-abdominal hemorrhage in pigs and found that the
occlusion, followed by surgical damage control improved survival in this animal
model of uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock caused by abdominal trauma. Thus, aortic
balloon occlusion could be considered for the management of severe abdominal
trauma. Along the same line, Markov et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> employed a porcine model to test the
effects of resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta. Their
results indicate that shock improves mean central aortic pressure, but is
associated with a greater lactate burden; however, this lactate burden returned
to control levels within the study period. They claim that the procedure is
ultimately survivable and potentially life-saving. This is still a very
precarious concept requiring further examination before being even considered
for clinical use. Rocha et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> analyzed pulse pressure variation in
anesthetized male pigs under four different respiratory regimens: I)
normovolemia and spontaneous breathing; II) hypovolemia and spontaneous
breathing; III) hypovolemia under mechanical ventilation; and IV) after volume
replacement, under mechanical ventilation. Cardiac output, pulmonary artery
occlusion pressure, systolic pressure variation, mean arterial pressure, and
heart rate were measured at all stages; red blood cell count was determined at
stages I, II, and IV. Pulse pressure variation values were higher during
spontaneous breathing than during mechanical ventilation. This may be a useful
model for the assessment of fluid volume, with baseline values as a starting
point to which serial measurements should be compared after the institution of
specific therapies.</p></sec><sec><title>Trauma</title><p>A number of animal trials have been performed on the combined effects of
hemorrhage and trauma. Here we deal only with trauma not affecting the brain,
which will be the object of the next section. N&#x000f6;t et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup>
studied the effects of glucosamine (to increase O-GlcNAc synthesis) or
O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranosylidene) amino N-phenyl carbamate - PUGNAc
(to inhibit O-GlcNAc removal) in rats subjected to a trauma-hemorrhage protocol.
By way of clarifying concepts I have allowed myself to note that O-GlcNAc is a
special type of protein glycosylation factor that acts exclusively within the
nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of the cell. The maintenance of O-GlcNAc
synthesis (through glucosamine or PUGNAC) was shown to increase survival of
hemorrhage/traumatized rats. However, only PUGNAc treatment attenuated
significantly the subsequent tissue injury and inflammatory responses,
suggesting that inhibition of O-GlcNAc removal may represent a new therapeutic
approach for the treatment of hypovolemic shock. Kim et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> evaluated the effect
of 17&#x003b2;-estradiol administration on cardiovascular parameters in male rats
after trauma-hemorrhage for an extended period (3 hours) of severe hypotension;
this study was based on single photon emission computed tomography imaging
performed on the blood-pool. They found a significantly larger blood volume in
heart, kidney, and liver of rats after therapy, which supports the notion that
17&#x003b2;-estradiol produces salutary effects on the cardiovascular system
after trauma-hemorrhage. Chai et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> studied the effect of exogenous hydrogen sodium
sulfide (NaHS) on the evolution of trauma + hemorrhage in rats resuscitated with
Ringer lactate, with/without the addition of hydrogen sulfide. NaHS resulted in
an increase in mean arterial blood pressure, positive and negative left
ventricular pressure [dP/dt(max)]. Aspartate aminotransferase,
alanine aminotransferase, blood urea nitrogen, and serum creatinine were reduced
in the NaHS-treated group. NaHS also significantly reduced the mortality rate at
24h. The study demonstrates that exogenous NaHS confers protective effects after
trauma-hemorrhage and resuscitation, by preventing a decrease in the antioxidant
defense system. Once again, it is a study that requires more research but such
research is certainly justified by results so far expounded.</p><p>Resveratrol has been shown to have protective effects for patients in shock-like
states, and protein kinase B is known to play a role in pro-inflammatory events
in response to injury. Tsai et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> endeavored to determine whether resveratrol
provides cardio-protection mediated via an protein kinase B -dependent pathway
in rats submitted to trauma plus hemorrhage. Their results suggest that
resveratrol attenuates cardiac injury following trauma-hemorrhage, which is, at
least in part, due to its anti-inflammatory effects via the protein kinase B -
dependent pathway. Pulathan et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> evaluated the effect of ethyl pyruvate on the
systemic inflammatory response and lung injury in an experimental rat model of
ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. Compared to untreated animals, rats treated
with ethylpyruvate presented reduced levels of serum myeloperoxydase,
malondialdehyde, and tumor necrosis factor-a. They conclude that ethyl pyruvate
reduces systemic inflammatory response and lung injury resulting from trauma and
shock. Taghavi et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup> note that patients suffering from penetrating
trauma and severe hemorrhagic shock are at risk of receiving positive pressure
ventilation during transport to definitive care. They claim that this mode of
ventilation has harmful physiologic effects in severe low-flow states and that a
different regimem, termed permissive hypoventilation would result in better
outcomes. Therefore they set up a swine model to test the concept that
"permissive hypoventilation," where manual breaths are not given and oxygen is
administrated passively via facemask. They found that although permissive
hypoventilation leads to respiratory acidosis, it results in less hemodynamic
suppression and better perfusion of vital organs. They suggest that in severely
injured patients, with penetrating trauma, consideration should be given to
immediate transportation, rather than to positive pressure breathing procedures.
This is part of a rather controversial concept according to which rapid
transport to an emergency care unit is more essential than pre-hospital
interventions. It is quite obvious that trauma, in itself defies concepts of
simple unilateral solutions. The same will apply to the reports under the next
three headings, namely traumatic brain injury, burn and sepsis.</p></sec><sec><title>Traumatic brain injury</title><p>Seven papers analyzed animal models of traumatic brain injury. The lingering
controversy on whether hypertonic saline or mannitol is more effective in the
treatment of traumatic brain injury was revisited by Marks et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup>
they find that the two formulae are undistinguishable in terms of the activation
of the neutrophil-endothelial interaction in the brain. However, additional
studies may be needed to determine whether either type of osmotherapy has more
subtle effects on the interaction in terms of a potential clinical advantage.
Chen et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup>
note that traumatic brain injury may influence the physiological response to
acute blood loss and endeavored to determine if the combination of severe
hemorrhage and standardized brain trauma may influence the dynamics of the
microcirculation. This study was performed in rats; the effects of hemorrhage
vs. traumatic brain injury upon red blood cell velocity and blood flow in
arterioles and venules were compared. Venular dynamics was similar in both
groups, arteriolar velocity and blood flow decreased to a similar extent in both
groups; however, 60 min after the insult an overshoot of velocity and flow was
observed exclusively in the combined insult group. It thus appears that the
brain insult modulated arteriolar responses to hemorrhage in third-order
vessels, but further research is necessary to precisely define the role of brain
insult on the microcirculation in tissues vulnerable to hemorrhage. Skotak et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</sup>
describe a new model of graded neurotrauma by varying the helium pressure in a
trauma tube applied to rats. The immunostaining for immunoglobulin G of brain
sections of these rats sacrificed 24 hours afer exposure showed a diffuse
breakdown of the blood-brain barrier in the cerebral parenchyma. A non-linear
function of acute response and of mortality vs. peak helium pressure is
reported. Abdul-Muneer et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</sup> induced mild traumatic head injury in rats and
found that brain injury is initiated by the induction of the free
radical-generating enzymes NADPH oxidase-1 and inducible nitric oxide synthase.
This hypothesis was further confirmed by the activation of caspase-3 and cell
apoptosis mostly around the perivascular region. As discussed earlier, Jepsen et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>
examined the hypothesis that severe isolated traumatic brain injury causes
shedding of endothelial glycocalyx. Also as previously noted, the interaction of
valproic acid with traumatic brain injury was reported by Dekker et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>
in a clinically relevant large animal model of combined brain trauma and
hemorrhage. Dekker et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]</sup> examined the interaction of traumatic brain injury
and hemorrhage in swine treated with normal saline, hypertonic saline +
hetastarch or fresh frozen plasma. The main object of this investigation was to
determine the effects of the alternative treatments on coagulation and
endothelial function. Normal saline was associated with an early activation of
coagulation, anticoagulation and endothelial function. Thus, normal saline may
be considered to be a superior form of treatment in terms of coagulation.
However it is pertinent to ask whether this response is ultimately
beneficial.</p></sec><sec><title>Burn</title><p>Two papers analyzed experimental burn models. Hernekamp et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]</sup> analyzed the effects
of plasma obtained from rats submitted to thermal burn and transferred to
healthy unburnt rats. Cinanserin, a specific 5-HT2 receptor-blocking agent was
administered to determine whether burn induced systemic edema can be reduced.
Intravital microscopy was performed in mesenteric venules to determine systemic
edema by FITC-albumin extravasation. Additionally, leukocyte activation (cells/
mm2) was observed. Burn-plasma-transfer results in systemic capillary leakage
leading to systemic burn edema. However, intraveneous application of Cinanserin
abolished this response. They conclude that this specific 5-HT2 antagonism
reduces systemic burn edema and leukocyte activation after plasma transfer.
Reduction of capillary leakage may be partially mediated by leukocyte dependent
as well as independent mechanisms. The entire subject of vascular permeability
in burn injury has been expertly reviewed by Huang et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]</sup> covering a large
amount of scientific information in many instances published in Chinese
periodicals and infrequently cited in the western scientific press. Very
detailed data from these publications are reproduced and should be carefully
analyzed by readers interested in the theme. </p></sec><sec><title>Sepsis</title><p>This is not a comprehensive examination of published work on sepsis, but
exclusively about articles on sepsis accompanying experimental shock procedures.
Maybauer et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]</sup> used a well established ovine model of septic shock
following severe smoke inhalation injury to perform a prospective, randomized,
controlled experimental study; the object of this study was to determine the
effects of the peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst WW-85 on global hemodynamics
and regional microvascular blood flow. The untreated control group developed a
hypotensive, hyperdynamic circulation condition and increased plasma levels of
nitrate and nitrite. All hemodynamic variables were significantly improved in
the treatment group. Cerebral blood flow deteriorated in controls, but was
significantly improved in cerebral cortex, cerebellum, pons, medulla oblongata,
and thalamus by WW-85. These results provide evidence that WW-85 blocks NO
production, thereby improving cardiovascular function and microcirculation.
Miranda et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]</sup> investigated the effects of heparin on
endotoxemia-related microcirculatory changes and compared them to those observed
with the use of recombinant human activated protein C. Heparin decreased
lipopolysaccharide-induced leukocyte rolling and arteriolar vasoconstriction;
survival increased in treated vs. non-treated animals. Administration of heparin
plus recombinant human activated protein C was associated with a significant
attenuation of lipopolysaccharide-induced capillary perfusion deficits. They
claim that heparin yields protective effects on endotoxemic animals'
microcirculation. Those benefits were potentiated when heparin was administered
in conjunction with recombinant human activated protein C. </p></sec><sec><title>Small volume hypertonic resuscitation</title><p>No review on shock and/or trauma by this writer would be complete without
reference to this final theme. It became a theme of intense basic and clinical
research in the seventies and eighties as a consequence of research in which
this writer played a role and is still present in current reports. A
comprehensive review on the subject has been published
elsewhere<sup>[<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]</sup>, but a number of new reports have appeared. Gong et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]</sup>
evaluated the effect of 5% hypertonic saline on the interaction of neutrophils
and endothelial cells in the blood brain microcirculation. They find that at
this unique endothelial barrier neutrophil-endothelial crosstalk is activated in
contrast to what occurs in other locations. Granfeldt et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]</sup> combined 7.5% NaCl
with adenosine, lidocaine and magnesium (Mg<sup>2+)</sup> and found significant
improvements in cardiac index and oxygen delivery vs. conventional 7.5% NaCl.
The increase in cardiac index was due to a twofold increase in cerebrovascular
accident volume. It is obvious that adenosine and Mg may have been instrumental
in this response; the role played by lidocaine requires further investigation.
Dubick et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]</sup> report that hypertonic acetate resuscitation from
aortic cross-clamping offered only minor advantages over hypertonic bicarbonate
in terms of blood flow and anti-oxidant status. This observation should be
coupled with a previously reported one<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> showing that hypertonic acetate induces
significant pulmonary vasoconstriction. It is consequently safe to state that
hypertonic acetate is not an adequate resuscitative solution. In the only report
cited in this review which is not an animal model, Mola et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]</sup> tested the safety and
efficacy of hypertonic saline vs isotonic saline in off-pump coronary artery
bypass grafting and found that the solution is safe and raised venous pressure
return during the critical period of arterial anastomosis. As reported above,
Dekker et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]</sup> found that treatment of traumatic brain injury plus
hemorrhage with hypertonic saline + hydroxyethylstarch is less effective that
normal saline treatment. Also as reported above, Marks et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup> revisited the theme of
hypertonic saline vs. mannitol for the treatment of traumatic brain injury.
Taken together, these reports indicate a general shrinkage of interest
surrounding small volume hypertonic resuscitation, which may eventually turn out
to be useful in different scenarios, as for instance in cardiac surgery. </p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This provocative collection of articles describing experimental models of the effects
of shock and trauma upon the cardiovascular system indicate that valuable
information drawn from experimental models has been developed over the past 5 years
concerning endothelial stability, mesenteric lymph, vascular reactivity, traumatic

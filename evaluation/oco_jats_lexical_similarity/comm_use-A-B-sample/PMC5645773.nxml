However, M1 can be found under physiological conditions without any pathological stimuli. This study aimed to understand the involvement of RANKL-induced M1 macrophages in bone formation compared with pathologically induced macrophages. Fischer rats were used to investigate macrophage distribution in normal and injured femoral condyles <italic>in vivo</italic>. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were activated with LPS+IFN-&#x003b3; and RANKL to achieve M1 activation <italic>in vitro</italic>. Gene expression related to inflammation, osteoclastogenesis, angiogenesis, and migration was determined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Tissue macrophages showed distinct expression patterns at different bone regions. RANKL was found in close proximity to inducible nitric oxide synthase-positive (iNOS+) cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, suggesting an association between RANKL expression and iNOS+ cells, especially in trabecular bone. RANKL-induced macrophages showed a different cytokine secretion profile compared with pathologically induced macrophages. Both osteoclasts and M1 macrophages peaked on day 7 during bone healing. RANKL could trigger M1-like macrophages with properties that were different from those of LPS+IFN-&#x003b3;-induced macrophages. These RANKL-activated M1 macrophages were actively involved in bone formation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Macrophages are a heterogeneous population of hematopoietic origin that are involved in crucial innate immune defense and have tissue-specific functions in the regulation and maintenance of organ homeostasis. Tissue macrophages are identified in many tissues and have two key functions: (1) to respond to pathogens and modulate the adaptive immune responses and (2) to facilitate tissue repair and regeneration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> As heterogeneous cells with great plasticity, macrophages activated by interferon-&#x003b3; (IFN-&#x003b3;), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) achieve a &#x0201c;classically activated&#x0201d; or a &#x0201c;killer&#x0201d; phenotype (CAM, M1) characterized by high level secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the production of reactive nitrogen and oxygen intermediates. The current viewpoint on this process emerged from the inflammation model of immune responses and was linked with type 1 T helper cell responses and IFN-&#x003b3; production by antigen-activated immune cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> When exposed to cytokines secreted by type 2 T helper cells or other glucocorticoids and secosteroids, an alternative activated phenotype (M2) can be achieved with a profile that includes a strong expression of mannose receptors, scavenging molecules, and a high level production of ornithine and polyamines, which participate in parasite encapsulation, angiogenic promotion, and matrix remodeling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> The concept of multiple macrophage activation states is not new. However, extending this idea to tissue macrophages has gained increased interest in recent years because these unique phenotypes likely reflect the different functions and influence of the tissue environment in which they reside.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup></p><p>Tissue macrophages are closely associated with common diseases. M1 macrophages have been reported to promote atherosclerosis by secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> Although M2 macrophages help the blood vessels remove cholesterol, when the cholesterol level changes, the M2 macrophages become foam cells that contribute to the atheromatous plaques of atherosclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> In Crohn's disease, M2 macrophages, but not M1 macrophages, display lower tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> levels, abnormal morphological maturation, prolonged intracellular bacterial survival, and different surface marker expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> In addition, an unrestrained pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage population induced by iron has been found to impair wound healing in humans and in mice. Conversely, M2 macrophages decrease the pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and secrete components of the extracellular matrix that may be essential in the late phases of tissue repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup></p><p>The traditional notion of M1 macrophages has been formed under the influence of pathological stimuli such as IFN-&#x003b3; and LPS. It is understandable because the innate immune system is usually activated by the induction of pathogens, vaccines, and tumors, and the innate immune response is often studied in the context of host defense. Macrophages are the critical effectors and regulators of inflammation, and their activation has been closely associated with pathogenic stimuli. Therefore, M1 macrophages are activated <italic>in vitro</italic> via the induction of LPS and IFN-&#x003b3; to mimic the real environment. However, in some scenarios, such as in normal tissues, the traditional concept to investigate macrophage properties under inflammatory circumstances is no longer applicable. For example, M1 macrophages have been found in adipose tissues with the presence of integrin alpha X, where LPS and IFN-&#x003b3; could not be applied.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> It is assumed that these non-pathologically activated cells may reflect the real nature of M1 macrophages.</p><p>RANKL as the receptor activator of nuclear factor-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B ligand serves to activate osteoclasts, which are critically involved in bone resorption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> RANKL triggers inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and nitric oxide (NO) release in a time- and dose-dependent manner that can be specifically blocked by the RANKL decoy receptor osteoprotegerin. The inhibition of RANKL-induced NO increases osteoclast formation and bone resorption, which suggests that RANKL-regulated osteoclastogenesis could be restrained by NO production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> Because iNOS expression is elevated in M1 macrophages,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> it is of great interest to investigate whether M1 macrophages can be activated with the induction of RANKL and to compare the differences between RANKL- and LPS+IFN-&#x003b3;-induced macrophages. Although the rough dichotomy between physiologically induced (RANKL) and pathologically induced (LPS+IFN-&#x003b3;) macrophages does not fully capture the entire heterogeneity and complexity found among tissue macrophages, the goal of this study is to highlight the emerging interest in the unrestrained M1 macrophage and to provide a molecular basis for the development of novel approaches to prevent, manage, and treat bone-related diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent staining</title><p>Six male Fischer rats (Animal Resources Centre, Canning Vale, Western Australia, Australia) at 6 weeks of age were used in the <italic>in vivo</italic> study, which was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Queensland University of Technology (Approval number: 1400000023). Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded cortical bone and trabecular bone tissues were cut into 5-&#x003bc;m-thick slices followed by paraffin removal in xylene and rehydration with a graded ethanol series (100%, 90%, and 70%) for 5&#x02009;min each. The sections were boiled in tri-sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at 94&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 10&#x02009;min to achieve antigen retrieval and then cooled down to room temperature. Specimens were used for either immunohistochemical staining or immunofluorescent staining. For immunohistochemical staining, samples were incubated with 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 20&#x02009;min to quench endogenous peroxidase enzymes and 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) blocking buffer for 30&#x02009;min to reduce nonspecific binding. Primary antibodies against cluster of differentiation 68 (CD68; 1:300, ab125212, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), iNOS (1:200, ab15323, Abcam), C-C chemokine receptor type 7 (CCR7; 1:50, NB100&#x02013;712, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA), Arginase1 (1:100, sc-20150, Santa Cruz), cluster of differentiation 163 (CD163; 1:100, MCA342GA, AbD Serotec, Raleigh, NC, USA), and isotype controls, including rabbit IgG (N1699, DAKO, Carpinteria, CA, USA), mouse IgG1 (N1698, DAKO), and goat IgG (ab37373, Abcam), were applied at optimal dilutions and incubated at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 2&#x02009;h. This process was followed by incubation with a corresponding anti-mouse/rabbit secondary antibody (K4061, DAKO) and an anti-goat secondary antibody (1:250, ab97110, Abcam) for 30&#x02009;min at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. Diaminobenzidine (Dako) and Mayer's hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich) were used to visualize the staining. All stained sections were dehydrated through a series of graded alcohol baths of increasing concentration, cleared in xylene, and mounted with coverslips. Tissue macrophages that were identified by positive staining from three randomly selected sections were recorded, and the strength of the immunohistochemical staining was quantified. Color threshold and binary conversion were used, and the integrated density of the target area was measured using ImageJ (V1.50e Fiji, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). For immunofluorescent staining, samples were permeabilized for 10&#x02009;min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and blocked with 1% bovine bovine serum albumin for 30&#x02009;min. Primary antibodies against iNOS (1:200, ab15323, Abcam) and RANKL (1:80, 12A668, Novus Biologicals) were applied at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 2&#x02009;h. Samples were then incubated with secondary antibodies including Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000, #4412, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) and Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:1&#x02009;000, A11004, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 30&#x02009;min at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. An Axio Imager M2 microscope (Zeiss) was used to observe the immunofluorescent intensity.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary cell culture</title><p>Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were harvested from the bone marrow of six C57BL/6 mice (Animal Resources Centre). The isolation of bone marrow-derived cells was performed by density gradient centrifugation, and the red blood cells were removed using red blood cell lysing buffer (Sigma-Aldrich). After centrifugation, the pellet was dissociated and seeded in culture flasks supplemented with Gibco RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin. After 4&#x02009;h of incubation, the supernatant was collected and filtered through a cell filter with 70&#x02009;&#x003bc;m pore size, and the adherent cells were kept for mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) culture.

Macrophages may undergo the M1 state in sustained RANKL induction and then differentiate into osteoclasts.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In addition to being immune sentinels on the frontline of immune defense, macrophages as a heterogeneous population are tissue-specific and are accurately positioned and transcriptionally programmed for encounters with environmental challenges.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> An analysis of the immune context, such as the location and functional orientation of macrophages and how they are integrated with local microenvironment, can provide important information and facilitate predictions of the macrophage response to various treatments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> Tissue macrophages were reported to promote intramembranous bone healing in a mouse tibial injury model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> Studies of macrophage subtypes show that during bone repair, inflammatory macrophages and resident macrophages coexist within the injury site.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> M2 macrophages were reportedly prevalent during the ossification phase in the process of fracture healing. Therefore, researchers think that the enhancement of the M2 phenotype in macrophages is an approach to promote bone healing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> Our experiment provides evidence that M1 and M2 tissue macrophages coexist in rat long bones. Macrophages that highly expressed M1 markers, however, consistently failed to express M2 markers. M1 and M2 macrophages shared similar expression patterns in cortical bone, but M1 macrophages showed a strikingly different morphology and distribution in trabecular bone near the growth plates. Bone remodeling is more active in the epiphyseal growth plate by a finely balanced cycle of cartilage growth, matrix formation, and cartilage calcification that enables long bones to increase in diameter and change shape.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> Combined with the anatomic location of M2 cells, these observations reveal that M1 cells may be more actively involved in the anabolic modeling of long bones. Interestingly, a number of M1 cells demonstrated an irregularly elongated shape distinct from that of normal macrophages and osteoclasts, which suggests that these elongated cells may exist in a unique state with potentially distinct functions.</p><p>The term &#x0201c;classical activation&#x0201d; of macrophages was first introduced in an infection context to describe the antigen-dependent microbicidal activity of macrophages toward bacillus Calmette-Guerin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> M1 activation can be achieved <italic>in vitro</italic> when IFN-&#x003b3;-primed cells encounter microbial products such as LPS by interacting with the extracellular receptors, resulting in a series of signaling cascade activations and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, and TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, and pro-inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandin E2 and NO. The factors secreted after IFN-&#x003b3; and LPS stimulation cooperatively regulate the transcription of their target genes, leading to the full priming of macrophages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27 bib28 bib29">27&#x02013;29</xref></sup> However, unlike the M2-dependent cytokines IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13, which are secreted by T lymphocytes and can be present under normal physiological conditions, LPS is a major constituent of Gram-negative bacteria and is mainly present in pathological states.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> Therefore, it is unreasonable to simply explain the presence of M1 cells through the stimulation of LPS. However, in physiological situations <italic>in vivo</italic>, cells may be slightly activated as a selective advantage and may not attain the full spectrum of functional capabilities.</p><p>The immunofluorescent results show that the number of iNOS-positive cells increased with the elevated expression level of RANKL, suggesting a potential relationship between M1 cells and RANKL. The <italic>in vitro</italic> data further confirm that BMDMs experience a similar M1 alteration during osteoclastic differentiation. Treatment with RANKL increased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and iNOS in macrophages, but not as strongly as LPS+IFN-&#x003b3;. This result indicates that M1 activation can be achieved by RANKL in the absence of LPS and IFN-&#x003b3;. Osteoclastic precursors are known to produce large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines during differentiation induced by RANKL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> These pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, and TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, are markers for M1 macrophages. Therefore, M1 macrophages may be associated with the presence of RANKL while differentiating into osteoclasts. These RANKL-induced macrophages are semi-activated M1-like cells that may have different properties compared with the fully activated ones induced by LPS+IFN-&#x003b3;.</p><p>Because M1 macrophages and bone cells are in close physical contact in the trabecular bone, we sought to determine the impact of macrophage subtypes on osteogenesis <italic>in vitro</italic>. The balance between immune and skeletal systems can be affected by the inflammatory state of the local microenvironment. In this regard, differential subtypes of macrophages are postulated to have an important role in regulating the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> Our results show that co-culture with RANKL-CM elevated the osteogenic ability of MSCs, as indicated by the increases in bone-related gene expression and matrix mineralization, which suggest that the transient inflammatory phase M1-like cells brought in at the early stage of osteogenesis may be crucial for enhanced bone formation.</p><p>Osteoclasts are terminal cells that specialize in bone resorption, which is irreplaceable for the continual physiological process of bone remodeling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> More importantly, osteoclasts are committed to the induction of RANKL through the receptor activator of nuclear factor <italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B (RANK),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> which was found to be associated with M1 macrophages in our present study. To identify the roles of bone-specific osteoclasts and RANKL-activated M1 macrophages in natural bone healing, a bone defect model was established. The osteoclastic activity surrounding bone defects was not observed at the very beginning of bone healing. The number of osteoclasts increased markedly on the seventh day post surgery and decreased at the late-stage post injury, thus implying a certain correlation between osteoclastic activity and the emergence of bone formation.</p><p>Studies have shown that macrophage subtypes are required for tissue repair and bone remodeling and that the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by macrophages has a vital role in early fracture repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> Our study suggests that CD68+ cells present in the defect first (maximum on day 4) and may then be polarized to M1 macrophages or become osteoclasts, resulting in the M1 and osteoclasts peaks on day 7. The number of macrophages and M1 cells peaked early and returned to normal accompanied by the appearance of M2 cells. Other studies suggest that some M2 macrophages present at wound-healing sites were originally M1 macrophages <italic>in vivo</italic> and that the modulation of macrophage phenotypes from M0 to M2 and M1 to M2 induced by IL-4 can be achieved <italic>in vitro</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup> All available lines of evidence show that a proper balance of an inflammatory state (M1) followed by an anti-inflammatory state (M2) is critical for normal bone healing. Indeed, there were similar morphological and phenotypic shifts of macrophages during bone healing in our study. As macrophages can undergo dynamic transitions between different functional states, it is possible that a balance between M1/M2 phenotypes underlies these states to maintain bone homeostasis. Although M2 cells can be generated by T lymphocyte-secreted cytokines, the precise origin and capability of M2 cells still require further investigation.</p><p>Altogether, our study reveals a variable and multifaceted profile of tissue macrophages, which goes beyond the well-characterized immune cells. We have demonstrated that physiological stimuli can induce the M1 subtype of macrophages. Compared with pathologically induced macrophages, they display distinct properties and may perform specialized, tissue-specific functions. These findings have substantiated the importance of tissue macrophages, particularly the M1 macrophages, and have provided new insights into inflammation control and potential intervention during bone healing.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The study was supported by the CSC (China Scholarship Council)-QUT (Queensland University of Technology) PhD Scholarship awarded to Ms Rong Huang and the Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation Early Career Researcher Scheme Funding awarded to Dr Yinghong Zhou.

Immunohistochemical staining was performed in sagittal serial sections of medial condyles from 6-week-old rats within the diaphyseal region. Cluster of differentiation 68 (CD68) was selected as a pan marker for the macrophage lineage, including monocytes, macrophages, giant cells, and osteoclasts. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and C-C chemokine receptor type 7 (CCR7) were selected as M1 phenotypic markers, whereas Arginase1 and cluster of differentiation 163 (CD163) were selected as M2 phenotypic markers. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining was performed as described in Materials and Methods. The distribution of CD68+ cells was divided into two patterns, one of which revealed the cells were mainly in the reticular tissue, and the other showed the cells were attached to bone surfaces to form a canopy-like structure over the osseous tissue. CD68+ (black arrows) and TRAP+ (white arrows) cells were not co-localized in cortical bone (<bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold>). Most of the M1 and M2 antibody-labeled cells were regular in shape and were not attached to the bone surfaces (<bold>c</bold>&#x02013;<bold>f</bold>).

RANKL induces the polarization of macrophages into the M1 phenotype that is present in normal long bones. Conversely, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, IL-13, and other glucocorticoids may promote the resolution of inflammation by skewing macrophages toward the M2 phenotype. M1 macrophages may be in a transient state that is similar to the pre-osteoclast state and finally turn into osteoclasts through the persistent induction of RANKL in the physiological environment.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="boneres201719-f8"/></fig><table-wrap id="tbl1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Primer sequences</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="center"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">Genes</th><th align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">Primer sequence (5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032;)</th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50"><italic>IL-1&#x003b2;</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">

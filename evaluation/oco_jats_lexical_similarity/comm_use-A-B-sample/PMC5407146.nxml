since the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Currently, due to the difficulties to obtain and
use cadavers, ethical issues and significant anatomic differences between animals
and humans<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup><sup>-</sup><sup><xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>, new methods to teach surgical
techniques have been pursued such as the use of artificial
simulators<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>.</p><p>Simulation may be defined as "the technique that imitates the behavior of a situation
or process (be it economic, military, mechanical, etc.) by means of an analogous
situation or device, specifically dedicated to study or personal
training"<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>; it may also be simply referred to as a "technique
that uses a simulator as an object of partial or total representation of a test to
be replicated"<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>.</p><p>The validity of simulations as a medical learning process has been scientifically
investigated<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup><sup>-</sup><sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. Research involving medical learning and teaching
using simulation is difficult to interpret, especially because one cannot be sure
whether the method has made any difference or whether those using the method were
more dedicated<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>.</p><p>Medical students have reached similar results in surgical techniques using simple or
sophisticated simulators<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup><sup>]</sup> and any training using simulators produced superior
results than theoretical training alone<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>.</p><p>There are different models of simulators as proposed by Andrade<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>, who used a dummy and
an anatomic specimen (heart): the model presented by Corso et
al.<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup><sup>]</sup> in the 41<sup>st</sup> Brazilian Congress of
Cardiovascular Surgery 2014 for training in videoassisted surgery, the project
produced by Johnson &#x00026; Johnson, by means of its subsidiary Ethicon, and even
models that produce movements, for the training of surgery without cardiopulmonary
bypass<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>, among others that are very sophisticated, where
anatomic models mimic the consistency and response of live tissues.</p><p>In the 42<sup>nd</sup> Brazilian Congress of Cardiovascular Surgery, we presented a
low-cost simulator using a shoebox<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. The model using a cardboard box caused some
problems: a) cardboard could not be used/stored in a hospital environment due to
contamination issues and because it obstructed the passage of natural light,
requiring a light source; b) it was limited to exercises related to coronary artery
disease and simple exercises in the aorta.</p><p>We abandoned the original cardboard box, but kept the low-cost concept of the initial
project. We propose the use of a transparent plastic box that eliminates the
previous contamination and light source problems, and add new methodology and
accessories to provide more surgical treatment options, including valve replacement
and valvoplasty, atrial septal defect correction and treatment of the aorta.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Preparation of the Simulator</title><p>The material used to manufacture the simulator was purchased in regular stores
(stationary stores, office depots, household supply and construction material
stores). To better evaluate cost, we separated the materials into permanent
materials, which are those required to build the simulator (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>) and consumables, which are those
used for the different exercises (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table

from these amounts, since they have to be used in any training.</p><table-wrap id="t1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Price of permanent materials used to manufacture the simulator. (Prices

A 20 cm width, 30 cm length, 10 cm
height transparent plastic box was used for each individual simulator. We used a
soldering iron to produce an oval 25 x 18 cm opening on the bottom of the box to
simulate an anterior thoracotomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure
1A</xref>). The box was then placed bottom up on a wooden shelf. Four grooves
were created with the soldering iron on the bottom corners of the box. Elastic
bands held the box to the shelf by these corner grooves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>

</p><p>Next to the four angles of the surface around the "thoracotomy", 2 mm holes were
made and through them we fixed approximately 2.5 cm wide rubberized fabric
straps along the full extension of the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). These straps hold the suture wires with 19 mm paper
clips during training, whereby Kelly forceps are therefore not required and, in
some cases, even assistants are not required.</p></sec><sec><title>Exercises</title><p>The structure providing the base for the aortic valve simulation is a simple 40
mm sewer pipe sleeve. At the lower end, two holes are punched on opposite sides
where 4.2 x 13 mm bolts are screwed in, which are used to attach this structure
to the wooden base with elastic bands. At the upper end, three 4 mm holes are
uniformly distributed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). These
holes are used to stich 5 cm silicone molds using cotton thread. Once they are
put in place, these molds simulate the aortic valve.</p><p>For the simulation of the mitral valve, a 50 x 45 mm sewer pipe elbow is used.
The finer end is cut at the bend so that the other end makes an angle with the
wooden surface. On the lower end, which is cut, four opposite 4 mm holes are
made for 4.2 x 13 mm bolts, which are used to attach this structure to the
wooden base with elastic bands. At the upper end, three 4 mm holes are uniformly
distributed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). These holes are
used to stitch 7 cm silicone molds using cotton thread. Once they are put in
place, these molds simulate the mitral valve. Mitral valve repair may also be
performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>) with mitral
neo-chordae grafts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>). For the
training of both the valvar prosthesis graft and the aortic aneurysm repair, the
bottom of the molds is resected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure

</p><p>For the simulation of aortic and mitral prosthesis, respectively 25 and 40 mm
welding caps are used. An ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) strap is attached to the
base of each cap to simulate the prosthesis rings. Each type of prosthesis
simulator is used in its own respective aortic and mitral valve simulator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref> shows an implanted aortic prosthesis.</p><p>For the training of aortotomy, aortorrhaphy, coronary proximal and distal
anastomoses, silicone ice trays and spaghetti party balloons are used. The ice
trays are attached to the wooden base with the elastic bands. Their surfaces
simulate the aortic rim for training purposes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4B</xref>). The
spaghetti balloons simulate the vein for proximal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>) and distal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure
4D</xref>) anastomoses.</p><p>

</p><p>To simulate the aorta in aortic aneurysm repair training, the mitral and aorta
simulator is used; however, the silicone is inverted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>). The aortic tube to be grafted is made from EVA
fabric. This fabric is cut and rolled to the desired diameter, and then attached
with hot glue (overlapping rims by 1cm). It will have to be sutured at the
proximal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>) and distal openings.
Coronary ostia regrafting with spaghetti balloon anastomosis on the lateral
portion of the inverted silicone mold may also be trained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C</xref>). Finally, an end-to-end EVA pipe anastomosis may
be performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>

</p><p>To train closure of atrial septal defect, the same mitral support is used. After
the patch suturing exercise, a tricuspid annuloplasty may be subsequently
performed using the same model (around the sutured patch).</p><p>The trainee alone, under supervision of a senior surgeon, did most exercises.
Some exercises needed the help of an assistant who was the senior surgeon or
another trainee. There by, each thoracotomy simulator was individual, but could
be used to train surgeon and first assistant surgeon simultaneously.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>At our service, training was carried out by means of bench exercises, totaling nearly
22 hours, with supervised exercises every fortnight. Those exercises were later
repeated at home or anywhere else, since every resident received an off-laboratory
kit to use. The minimum amount of repetitions was set on the basis of exercise
difficulty level. From the minimum amount of required exercises, we then calculated
the total consumables used (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>There was training on aortorrhaphy, aorta purse string suture, proximal and distal
coronary anastomoses, valve disease treatment, aortic disease repair, and atrial
septal correction. We noticed that the repetition of these exercises facilitated the
performance of residents on a surgical field. Residents evaluated this subjectively
after the end of their training period.</p><p>The exercises were performed in a well-lit setting, without the need for a surgical
light source.</p><p>The straps at the edge of the box providing support to the paper clips enabled
training with reduced surgical materials, such as Kelly forceps, and in some cases
avoiding the help of an assistant, thus providing for reduced costs and easy
training anywhere, including home. Total cost per resident was US$ 38.01, where
permanent materials were estimated at US$ 19.20 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>) and consumables, at US$ 18.81 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>) (prices collected in the first semester of 2015).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In spite of how easy and cheap it was to obtain the simulator, our first one could
not be used in a hospital setting because it is subjected to contamination. Since
the walls were opaque, there was need for a surgical light source, which made it
more difficult to use in any setting.</p><p>The solution found for that problem was to adopt a transparent plastic box, which is
easy to find in any retail household shop. And it helped eliminate the need for a
light source, both in and out of the laboratory.</p><p>In 2015 first semester values, the cost to make each exercise kit was below US$ 40,
which is affordable to any institution. If compared to simulators found in the
international market, this cost was up to 100 times cheaper. Furthermore, we should
always consider that some items, like the minimum sellable amounts of straps and
bolts cater to the needs of many simulators, which virtually writes off their cost.
The use of straps with fixing points eliminated the use of part of the surgical
instrumentation, which contributed to further reducing the institution's training
project costs.</p><p>Along with the new "thorax", we added a number of other exercises, such as valve
replacement and valvoplasty, atrial septal defect correction, aorta replacement, and
we also enhance "coronary" anastomoses. These exercises were cheerfully welcomed by
the young surgeons, who developed their skills in the use of some techniques they
only knew from theoretically.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The model described in this protocol is effective and lowcost when compared to
existing simulators, enabling a large array of cardiovascular surgery training.</p><table-wrap id="t4" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup width="50%" span="1"><col span="1"/><col span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1"><bold>Authors' roles &#x00026;

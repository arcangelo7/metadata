debate. There is growing evidence that coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)
benefits these patients. The current recommendations for revascularization in
this context are that CABG is reasonable when it comes to decreasing morbidity
and mortality rates for patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction
(ejection fraction &#x0003c;35%), and significant coronary artery disease (CAD) and
should be considered in patients with operable coronary anatomy, regardless
whether or not there is a viable myocardium (class IIb). Percutaneous coronary
intervention (PCI) does not have enough data to allow the panels to reach a
conclusion. The Korean Acute Heart Failure registry (KorAHF) had its data
released recently, showing that patients with acute HF who underwent CABG had
lower death rates, more complete revascularization and less adverse outcomes
compared with patients treated with PCI. Recent ESC/EACTS guidelines on
myocardial revascularization clearly recommended CABG as the first choice of
revascularization strategy in patients with multivessel disease and acceptable
surgical risk to improve prognosis in this scenario of left ventricular
dysfunction. However, a high peri-procedural risk must be compared with the
benefit of late mortality, and pros and cons of each strategy (either PCI or
CABG) must be weighed in the decision-making process. Spurred on by the
publication of the above-mentioned article and the release of new guidelines, we
went on to write an overview of the current practice of state-of-the-art
coronary revascularization options in patients with HF.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Coronary Artery Bypass</kwd><kwd>Stents</kwd><kwd>Percutaneous Coronary Intervention</kwd><kwd>Heart Failure</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><table-wrap id="t3" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="10%" span="1"/><col width="90%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" style="background-color:#e6e7e8" rowspan="1">Abbreviations,

(HEART) trial<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>, which enrolled 138 patients with HF, CAD and a
LVEF &#x02264;35%, who had a substantial volume of viable myocardium with
contractile dysfunction, assessed by any standard imaging technique, randomly
assigned to a strategy of conservative management <italic>versus</italic>
angiography with the intent of PCI or CABG. After a median follow-up of 59
months, there were 25 (37%) deaths in those assigned to the conservative
strategy, and 26 (38%) in those assigned to the invasive strategy, 13 (29%) of
whom were revascularized. However, this study was underpowered and, further,
larger trials were required to settle this issue.</p><p>The Alberta Provincial Project for Outcome Assessment in Coronary Heart Disease
(APPROACH)<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> compared the outcomes of patients propensity
matched to obtain comparable subgroups with CAD and left ventricular dysfunction
undergoing CABG (n=718) <italic>versus</italic> PCI (n=718). The analysis
identified that CABG was significantly associated with lower rates of repeat
revascularization and better survival compared with PCI at 1, 5, 10 and 15
years.</p><p>The CREDO-Kyoto PCI/CABG Registry Cohort-2<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> identified 3,584 patients with
3-vessel and/or left main disease of 15,939 patients undergoing first myocardial
revascularization, and 908 with LVEF &#x0003c;50%. In both patients with moderate and
severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction, the risk of cardiac death after
PCI was significantly greater than after CABG. Similarly, the risk of all-cause
death tended to be higher after PCI than after CABG in both patients with
moderate and severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction. CABG was associated
with better 5-year survival outcomes than PCI in patients with LVEF &#x0003c;50% with
complex CAD in the era of drug-eluting stents.</p><p>In the Surgical Treatment Ischemic Heart Failure (STICH)
trial<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>, 1,212 patients with CAD and LVEF &#x02264;35%
were randomized to medical therapy or CABG. Patients with LM disease were
excluded, 17% of patients on medical therapy underwent CABG and 6% of patients
underwent PCI by the end of the follow-up period. In the intention-to-treat
analysis, all-cause mortality was not significantly lower with CABG than with
medical therapy; however, all-cause mortality or hospitalization for
cardiovascular causes occurred less frequently among patients undergoing CABG.
The results with respect to all other secondary clinical outcomes also favored
CABG. In addition, CABG was associated with a reduced risk for the primary
outcome (death) in the "as-treated" analysis, which compared the outcomes of 592
patients treated with medical therapy throughout the first year after
randomization with those of 620 patients who underwent CABG-either as a
consequence of randomization or crossover-and reported significantly lower
all-cause mortality in favor of CABG.</p><p>In 2016, the authors reported the results of the STICH Extension Study
(STICHES)<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>, which was conducted to evaluate the long-term
effects of CABG in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. The rate of death from
any cause over 10 years was lower by 16% among patients who underwent CABG in
addition to receiving medical therapy than among those who received medical
therapy alone. Overall, CABG was associated with an incremental median survival
benefit of nearly 18 months and prevention of one death due to any cause for
every 14 patients treated and of one death due to a cardiovascular cause for
every 11 patients treated. CABG was associated with more favorable results than
isolated medical therapy across all clinically relevant long-term outcomes
evaluated by the authors. These findings were directionally similar to those
reported earlier. The choice between CABG and PCI should be made by the heart
team after careful evaluation of the patient's clinical status and coronary
anatomy, including SYNTAX Score, comorbidities and expected completeness of
revascularization. A specialist in heart failure should be consulted.</p><p>Because PCI has become an established treatment option for selected patients with
CAD and the STICH trial did not include a PCI arm, some groups sought to assess
the comparative effectiveness of CABG <italic>versus</italic> PCI among patients
with reduced ventricular function and multivessel CAD. For example, the Northern
New England Cardiovascular Disease Study Group (NNECDSG)<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> is a voluntary
regional consortium of 7 hospitals in New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine that
provide the majority of PCI and cardiac surgery in the region. The authors
examined all patients undergoing primary isolated coronary revascularization
from 2004 to 2014. To simulate a real-world STICH-like population, the inclusion
and exclusion criteria for the STICH trial were applied. Specifically, were
included in the analysis patients who had EF &#x02264;35% and 2- or 3-vessel CAD.
The final study cohort was 955 CABG and 718 PCI patients. The median duration of
follow-up was 4.3 years. CABG was associated with improved long-term survival
compared to PCI after risk adjustment. Although CABG and PCI had similar 30-day
mortality rates, CABG was associated with a higher frequency of cerebrovascular
accidents and acute kidney injury, whereas PCI was associated with a higher
incidence of repeat revascularization. The authors concluded that, among
patients with reduced ejection fraction and multivessel disease, CABG was
associated with improved long-term survival compared with PCI and should be
strongly considered in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and multivessel
coronary disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Could PCI Provide Comparable Outcomes to CABG in Patients with HF?</title><p>Yang et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> enrolled patients with reduced left ventricular
systolic function, defined as a LVEF &#x0003c;50%, who had PCI with drug-eluting
stent (DES) or CABG from the Cardiovascular Catheterization and Surgery
Databases of Samsung Medical Center. There was no statistically significant
difference in all-cause death in the follow-up (median duration of 32 months).
In the propensity score matching analysis performed in 141 patient pairs, the
long-term cumulative mortality rate was not significantly different between the
groups. However, the rate of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events
was higher in the DES group than the CABG group, which was explained by the
higher incidence of repeat revascularization in the DES group.</p><p>Bangalore et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> selected patients with multivessel disease and
LVEF &#x02264;35% who underwent either PCI with everolimus-eluting stent (n=1063)
or CABG (n=1063) with propensity score matching from the New York State
Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Reporting System. In the short term, PCI was
associated with a lower risk of stroke in comparison with CABG. At long-term
follow-up (median of 2.9 years), PCI was associated with a similar risk of
death, a higher risk of myocardial infarction, a lower risk of cerebrovascular
accident, and a higher risk of repeat revascularization. Completeness of
revascularization played a major role in this study, such that, in patients in
whom complete revascularization was achieved with PCI, there was no difference
in myocardial infarction between PCI and CABG.</p></sec><sec><title>A Word of Caution</title><p>Although it seems clear that patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction
benefit most from revascularization, nothing is set in stone yet. A high
peri-procedural risk must be balanced against late mortality benefit and pros
and cons of each strategy (either PCI or CABG) must be weighed up in the
decision-making process.</p><table-wrap id="t4" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="5%" span="1"/><col width="95%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026;

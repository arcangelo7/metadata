Bones continuously undergo formation and resorption, but certain diseases can interfere with this remodeling process, leading to loss of bone mass. Previous studies by Di Chen at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, US, and co-workers found that mice without a key protein called CHIP display increased osteoclast formation and abnormally high levels of bone resorption. Further investigations by Chen&#x02019;s team now indicate that CHIP deficiency also results in reduced bone formation and loss of mass. They found that CHIP regulates a family of proteins called TRAF&#x02014;the overexpression of which disturbs the precise balance of osteoclast/osteoblast bone cell formation. CHIP may provide a target for drug development for bone loss diseases.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Bone remodeling is a dynamic process, involving a balance between the activity of bone-forming osteoblasts, derived from mesenchymal progenitor cells, and the activity of bone-resorbing osteoclasts, derived from hematopoietic stem cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> A disruption of this balance leads to many bone and joint diseases, especially metabolic bone diseases.

The results of Western blot analysis showed that the protein levels of TRAF2 were decreased when CHIP expression was increased in 293 T cells. In contrast, the mutant CHIP (H260Q), which lacks the E3 ligase ability, failed to affect steady state protein levels of TRAF2 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>).

In addition, protein levels of TRAF5 were also decreased when CHIP expression is increased (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). The IP result demonstrated that TRAF5 was co-precipitated by CHIP in 293 T cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>). To determine if CHIP-induced TRAF5 degradation is ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent, we treated cells with proteasome inhibitor MG-132.

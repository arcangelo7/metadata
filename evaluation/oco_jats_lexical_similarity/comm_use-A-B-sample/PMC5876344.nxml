Omentin-1 is a newly identified adipocytokine that has anti-inflammatory effects, but little is known about the role of omentin-1 in inflammatory osteoporosis. Here we generated global <italic>omentin-1</italic> knockout (<italic>omentin-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) mice and demonstrated that depletion of omentin-1 induces inflammatory bone loss-like phenotypes in mice, as defined by abnormally elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines, increased osteoclast formation and bone tissue destruction, as well as impaired osteogenic activities. Using an inflammatory cell model induced by tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;), we determined that recombinant omentin-1 reduces the production of pro-inflammatory factors in the TNF-&#x003b1;-activated macrophages, and suppresses their anti-osteoblastic and pro-osteoclastic abilities. In the magnesium silicate-induced inflammatory osteoporosis mouse model, the systemic administration of adenoviral-delivered omentin-1 significantly protects from osteoporotic bone loss and inflammation. Our study suggests that omentin-1 can be used as a promising therapeutic agent for the prevention or treatment of inflammatory bone diseases by downregulating the pro-inflammatory cytokines.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="LongSummary"><title>Osteoporosis: Fat-secreted protein guards against bone loss in mice</title><p id="Par2">An anti-inflammatory molecule produced by fat tissue helps protect against bone loss in mouse model of osteoporosis. Researchers from China&#x02019;s Central South University in Changsha, led by Hui Xie, examined whether omentin-1, a protein secreted by fat tissue recently implicated in the development of obesity and diabetes, might play a role in osteoporosis as well. In mice engineered to lack omentin-1, they observed more bone tissue destruction and increased numbers of bone-resorbing osteoclast cells than in normal, healthy animals. The researchers also administered exogenous omentin-1 to mice either with an overactive inflammatory molecule or experimentally induced to develop osteoporosis. In both cases, they found that the protein suppressed inflammation and guarded against bone loss. Omentin-1 thus provides promising therapeutic agent for preventing or treating inflammatory bone diseases such as osteoporosis.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Bone remodeling is a lifelong process in vertebrates that relies on the balance between bone formation by osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> When the balance is disrupted, as is seen in chronic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis, abnormal bone loss and osteoporotic fractures often occurs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> Studies have reported that increases in the pro-inflammatory cytokines during chronic inflammation make an important contribution to bone loss by promoting osteoclast differentiation and/or inhibiting osteoblast maturation and function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> Thus, strategies designed to inhibit pro-inflammatory activities hold promise in promoting bone regeneration and preventing inflammation-induced osteoporosis.</p><p id="Par4">Omentin-1, also referred to as intelectin-1 (ITLN1), is a novel adipocytokine that is highly expressed in human visceral fat tissue and in mouse small intestine.

The results revealed that a base (A) was successfully inserted into the sequence of omentin-1 gene and caused a depletion of omentin-1 protein in small intestines (the organ showing the highest expression of omentin-1 in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>) of <italic>omentin-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice compared with their wild-type littermates. We then evaluated whether omentin-1 deficiency resulted in dysregulated inflammation.

As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, omentin-1 depletion caused a significant trabecular bone loss compared to wild-type mice. Further quantitative analysis determined that <italic>omentin-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice displayed remarkably reduced trabecular bone volume fraction, thickness, and number, and increased trabecular separation than that in wild-type mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b&#x02013;e</xref>). The periosteal perimeter of femoral diaphysis in <italic>omentin-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were also much lower than that of wild-type mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, f</xref>). Cortical bone thickness was also reduced in <italic>omentin-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice compared to wild-type mice, but the difference was not statistically significant (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, g</xref>).

Studies have revealed that these cytokines are capable of effectively stimulating RANKL production in osteoblasts and stromal cells, which enhance osteoclasts formation for degradation of the adjacent bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> Evidence has also shown that IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; can suppress osteoblast differentiation and activity via downregulating BMP and TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> In our study, we found that omentin-1 depletion in mice induced a local and systemic increase in the production of these pro-inflammatory cytokines, and overexpression of omentin-1 was effective to inhibit the magnesium silicate-induced upregulation of IL-1&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, and TNF-&#x003b1; in the bone tissue and/or in the blood stream of mice. In addition, we found that omentin-1 overexpression could markedly reduce the magnesium silicate-induced increase of pro-inflammatory macrophages (M1 phenotype) and enhance the amount of anti-inflammatory macrophages (M2 phenotype). These data, along with a recent study showing that omentin-1 is able to promote anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype during differentiation of monocytes into macrophages,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> suggest that omentin-1 may shift the macrophage phenotype overwhelmingly to M2 rather than M1, thus reducing the production of pro-inflammatory factors and maintaining normal bone mass. Since bacterial translocation in the gut and defense mechanism against intestinal bacterial permeation play crucial roles in chronic inflammation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> and the protein sequence of omentin-1 is determined to be identical to intelectin-1, a galactofuranose-binding protein that acts as a host defense against invading pathogenic microorganisms,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> the inhibition of bacterial translocation may also be an important mechanism by which omentin-1 prevents inflammation and protects bone. It should to be noted that the omentin-1 knockout mice also had a much higher level of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine able to inhibit bone resorption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> This may be a compensation reaction to inhibit the excessive inflammation caused by omentin-1 deficiency.</p><p id="Par20">In summary, our findings demonstrate that omentin-1 plays an essential role in the maintenance of normal bone mass and is able to alleviate magnesium silicate-induced inflammation and osteoporotic bone loss. The underlying mechanism may be the downregulation of the production of pro-inflammatory mediators in macrophages, as omentin-1 can inhibit the inflammatory responses of the activated macrophages and impair their anti-osteoblastic and pro-osteoclastic effects. Our study suggests that omentin-1 can be used as a therapeutic agent for the prevention and treatment of inflammatory bone diseases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Animals and treatments</title><p id="Par21">Animal care and experimental procedures were approved by the Laboratory Animal Management Committee of Central South University and performed in accordance with the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.</p><p id="Par22">The global <italic>omentin-1</italic> gene knockout (<italic>omentin-1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) C57BL/6 mice were generated by Cyagen Biosciences Inc.

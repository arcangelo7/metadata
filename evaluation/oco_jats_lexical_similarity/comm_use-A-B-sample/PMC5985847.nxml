coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery is one of the most accomplished and
studied procedures in the history of contemporary surgery<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Even with the use of arterial grafts, the great saphenous vein continues to be widely
used, and the graft is more common in CABG surgeries<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. Although the clinical
examination suggests the location of the saphenous vein, especially in the calf and
distal segment of the leg, its origin in the proximal thigh segments remains unknown
until surgical exploration<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. In addition, methods to predict the viability of
this venous graft prior to surgery are not always used, which may lead to increased
morbidity for the patient. This may occur if the great saphenous vein is considered
unsuitable for use in CABG surgery in the perioperative period, with the need for
dissection of the saphenous vein in the other leg or for obtaining an alternative
graft. Complications in the operated leg are not infrequent, such as the presence of
infections with wound dehiscence, paresthesia, distal edema, lymphangitis, and
erysipelas<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. There is also the possibility of ischemic ulcers in
patients with associated peripheral vascular disease.</p><p>Complications related to the surgical technique occur in up to 30% of patients
undergoing saphenectomy. Data from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) of
1999<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>,
which considered only the events observed during the hospital stay, report a rate of
4.5% of complications at the saphenectomy sites. Hematoma, seroma, wound dehiscence,
wound edges necrosis or infections, increase the hospital stay and delay the
rehabilitation<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. DeLaria et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> demonstrated a 12-day
increase in hospital stay due to complications at the saphenectomy sites. There was
an average increase of $ 9,900 per patient in hospital costs.</p><p>The clinical presentation of the infection may vary from localized cellulitis to an
extensive involvement of soft tissues, with drainage of secretions and areas of
extensive necrosis<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>. Infections occur in 1% to 5% of saphenectomies and
the processes of delayed healing can reach 10%<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Technical modifications were introduced to reduce complications, such as the use of
incisions in the leg initiated about 5 cm above the medial malleolus, extending
proximally<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>. Also commonly used is saphenectomy with small
staggered incisions, where interspersed incisions are made with skin islands in the
saphenous vein pathway, and early recovery with this technique was reported by
Tevaearai et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. Recently, minimally invasive techniques of
endoscopic saphenectomy would be related to lower rates of infection, hematoma,
seroma, and shorter hospitalization time. However, new studies are needed to
investigate the patency equivalence of the endoscopically dissected graft compared
to classical saphenectomy<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The use of Doppler ultrasonography for preoperative saphenous mapping may be useful
in the evaluation of saphenous vein characteristics and abnormalities, such as
diameter, presence of ectasias, sclerosis, thrombosis. Ultrasound studies have
demonstrated anatomical changes of the saphenous vein in more than 30% of the
limbs<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. With precise knowledge of the anatomy of the great
saphenous vein, a direct incision can be made on the marked vein segment, avoiding
large dissections, detachments and, consequently, bruising<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. In addition, the study
of saphenous vein characteristics may guide the choice of the leg for dissection,
avoiding unnecessary incisions if the graft is inappropriate for use in myocardial
revascularization surgery, reducing greater risks of surgical site infection and
prolonged hospital stay with consequent cost increase.</p><p>Doppler vascular ultrasonography is a noninvasive, inexpensive and easy-to-apply
method for mapping the great saphenous vein. It can be performed at the bedside,
with reproducible results in evaluating the quality and viability of the venous
graft, and may be useful in guiding the incision in the leg for guided dissection of
the great saphenous vein. This could avoid inadvertent dissection of non-viable
grafts, providing the choice of the best graft, and facilitating the procedure in
order to avoid inherent complications.</p><p>Thus, the present study aims to analyze the use of vascular ultrasonography to map
the saphenous vein in the preoperative period of myocardial revascularization
surgery to define viability and the best site for venous graft dissection, and its
impact on the reduction of unnecessary incisions and complications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>Patients undergoing CABG surgery with the use of a large saphenous vein were selected
in a prospective study, who were followed in the period from 01/14/2016 to
11/10/2016. The study was approved on 12/15/2015, by the ethics and research
committee of the Instituto Dante Pazzanese, with CAAE number: 51597615500005461.</p><p>Patients were divided into two homogeneous groups, in relation to age, presence of
diabetes, smoking and peripheral artery disease (PAD) and paired for
ultrasound-guided saphenectomy (Group 1) <italic>versus</italic> right thigh
saphenectomy with staggered incisions (Group 2).</p><p>The reduction in the frequency of infection, wound dehiscence, hematoma or seroma and
the need for contralateral saphenectomy due to inadequate graft were analyzed.</p><p>In this study, we selected 151 patients who would undergo myocardial
revascularization with the use of the great saphenous vein. In the first 84 patients
(Group 1) a high-resolution two-dimensional color Doppler ultrasonography was used
for the great saphenous vein mapping with a linear transducer and conductive gel.
The surgical marking of the path of the great saphenous vein to oriented incision
was done with permanent ink pen.</p><p>The venous mapping was performed with the patient in orthostatism, external rotation
of the leg and slight knee flexion. In the patients who could not stand up, it was
used a tourniquet at the thigh root with a 1-inch Penrose drain to occlude the
saphenous vein distal to the saphenofemoral junction. Initially the saphenofemoral
junction was found, and the great saphenous vein was followed throughout its path,
distally within the saphenous envelope. Venous diameter measurements were performed:
on the proximal third of the thigh, close to the saphenous arch, medial third of the
thigh, knee, middle third of the leg and distal third of the leg, anterior to the
medial malleolus. Saphenous vein diameters between 2 mm and 5 mm were considered
normal<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. Diameters smaller than 2 mm were considered unsuitable
for graft use. Diameters greater than 5 mm were considered as dilatation, and above
8 mm, graft use was contraindicated. Absence of the great saphenous vein, patency,
signs of chronic occlusion, thrombosis, presence of discontinuous segments, focal
dilations and precise location of the vein were also evaluated as criteria for the
adequacy of the conduit for a CABG surgery.</p><p>Another 67 patients underwent CABG surgery with the use of a dissected saphenous vein
with staggered incisions in the right lower limb without prior ultrasonographic
examination (Group 2), with similar characteristics in relation to age, presence of
diabetes, smoking and PAD.</p><p>The evaluation of operative wounds in the lower limbs was performed on the
1<sup>st</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> postoperative days, with direct visualization
during hospital admission by the surgeon and telephone contact on the
30<sup>th</sup> postoperative day. In case of doubt, the patient was advised to
return to the outpatient clinic for a new visual evaluation. The presence of
hematoma, seroma, wound infection, dehiscence, necrosis and need for resuturing were
evaluated.</p><p>Inclusion criteria: Patients older than 18 years, who signed informed consent form
and underwent CABG surgery using the great saphenous vein.</p><p>Exclusion criteria: Prior saphenectomy, emergency surgery, combined surgeries.</p><p>Primary outcomes: Need for contralateral incision due to inadequate graft in the
previously selected limb, infection, suture dehiscence, seroma or hematoma at the
surgical site, necrosis, need for resuturing.</p><p>In the quantitative variables we describe the mean and standard deviation, in
categorical variables by absolute and relative frequencies. To verify the difference
between the groups in the quantitative variables, we used the Mann-Whitney test. In
qualitative variables we used Fisher's exact test to verify the association between
them.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The groups were matched for age, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), sex, presence

</p><p>During follow-up, there were 4 (2.8%) deaths, all in Group 2
<italic>(P</italic>=0.036): a death in the 2<sup>nd</sup> postoperative day due to
cardiogenic shock, a death in the 5<sup>th</sup> postoperative day, with cardiac
arrest of unknown cause and 2 other patients during the 30-day follow-up whose exact
cause was not able to be informed by the companion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In most cases, in both groups, the right leg was selected preferentially, following
the routine of the institution. The left leg was selected in Group 2, in the
presence of visible varicosity in the right leg, and in Group 1, when the saphenous
vein was considered inadequate and the criteria were predetermined.</p><p>The selected groups presented similar characteristics and the difference in weight
did not interfere in the BMI, which was similar in both groups. The direct impact of
risk factors, diabetes, smoking, BMI, PAD on the incidence of surgical wound
infection and poor healing was not assessed in this study. These factors were
considered only in group correspondence.</p><p>The fact that the opening of the contralateral leg did not occur in Group 1 indicates
a good accuracy of the method in identifying and evaluating the graft quality.</p><p>The follow-up stratification sought to find a higher incidence of hematoma, seroma,
and suture dehiscence between the 1<sup>st</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> postoperative
days, which were directly related to the need for greater detachment and technical
difficulties in dissection, with a significant difference of events in the
5<sup>th</sup> postoperative day. On the 30<sup>th</sup> postoperative day, the
expectation was a higher incidence of infection, dehiscence, necrosis and need for
resuturing. Despite an absolute greater number of events of these categories at this
time, this was not statistically significant in the comparison between groups. This
fact may be due to an insufficient sample to prove the statistical power. However,
the total number of events over 30 days was significant, demonstrating benefit of
the intervention.</p><p>Previous studies evaluating complications at the site of saphenectomy for CABG showed
an incidence of infection similar to that found in the unmapped group. Belczak et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>
found 25% surgical saphenectomy wound infection, where dissection was performed by
staggered incisions without previous marking, whereas 31% of the complications
(hematoma, seroma, infection, dehiscence) were found in the unmapped patient group.
Gelape<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>
reported, in a literature review, similar numbers, with an incidence of
complications at the site of saphenectomy reaching 30%. The complication rate of the
surgical wound of saphenectomy in this study, of 12% among patients submitted to
pre-marking ultrasound, reinforces the efficiency of the method in reducing
events.</p><p>The deaths observed in the control group, despite having statistical significance,
cannot be associated with the use of vascular ultrasonography in this study, since
it was not designed with this objective. In addition, there was no consequent deaths
from saphenectomy site infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The use of vascular ultrasonography for the great saphenous vein mapping in isolated
myocardial revascularization surgery confers an adequate accuracy in the
identification of the grafts, and seems to have a good relation in the evaluation of
its quality, being able to measure its dimensions with precision. In this study, we
observed a lower incidence of complications related to the dissection of the great
saphenous vein in the mapped patients, with statistical significance.</p><p>As a noninvasive method of easy application, it should be routinely used in
myocardial revascularization procedures. New studies with cost/benefit assessment
may be useful for evaluating and implementing the method in cardiac surgery
services.</p><table-wrap id="t5" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="10%" span="1"/><col width="90%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FCL</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Substantial contributions to the

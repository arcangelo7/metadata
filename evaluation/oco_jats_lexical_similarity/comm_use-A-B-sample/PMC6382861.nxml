While numerous Cre models exist to target gene recombination in osteoblasts and osteoclasts, few target osteocytes specifically, particularly mature osteocytes. Our goal was to create a spatial and temporal conditional Cre model using tamoxifen to induce Cre activity in mature osteocytes using a Bac construct containing the 5&#x02019; and 3&#x02019; regions of the <italic>Sost</italic> gene (Sost ER<sup>T2</sup> Cre). Four founder lines were crossed with the Ai9 Cre reporter mice. One founder line showed high and specific activity in mature osteocytes. Bones and organs were imaged and fluorescent signal quantitated. While no activity was observed in 2&#x02009;day old pups, by 2 months of age some osteocytes were positive as osteocyte Cre activity became spontaneous or &#x02018;leaky&#x02019; with age. The percentage of positive osteocytes increased following tamoxifen injection, especially in males, with 43% to 95% positive cells compared to 19% to 32% in females. No signal was observed in any bone surface cell, bone marrow, nor in muscle with or without tamoxifen injection. No spontaneous signal was observed in any other organ. However, with tamoxifen injection, a few positive cells were observed in kidney, eye, lung, heart and brain. All other organs, 28 in total, were negative with tamoxifen injection. However, with age, a muscle phenotype was apparent in the Sost-ER<sup>T2</sup> Cre mice. Therefore, although this mouse model may be useful for targeting gene deletion or expression to mature osteocytes, the muscle phenotype may restrict the use of this model to specific applications and should be considered when interpreting data.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="LongSummary"><title>Animal model: Transgenic mice offer platform to study mature osteocytes</title><p id="Par2">A new transgenic mouse allows DNA modifications to be targeted to mature bone cells known as osteocytes, enabling researchers to better study the function of this cell population, although the model has some weaknesses that may restrict its use. Lynda Bonewald from Indiana University, Indianapolis, USA, and colleagues engineered mice to express introduced genetic material only in cells in which a gene called <italic>Sost</italic> is normally active &#x02014; namely, osteocytes &#x02014; and only when experimenters introduce a drug called tamoxifen. In general, transgene activity was contained to the osteocytes, but a full characterization of the mice showed some issues. For one, spontaneously transgene expression occurred in older mice in the absence of tamoxifen, although this was limited to the mature bone cells. With tamoxifen, the researchers observed some transgene expression outside of the bone. Most problematically, there were some broad muscle defects.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Bone</kwd><kwd>Metabolism</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Health &#x00026;amp; Human Services | National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1PO1AG039355</award-id><award-id>1PO1AG039355</award-id><award-id>1PO1AG039355</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Mark L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Brotto</surname><given-names>Marco</given-names></name><name><surname>Bonewald</surname><given-names>Lynda F.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Health &#x00026;amp; Human Services | NIH | National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RC2 AR058962</award-id><award-id>S10RR027668</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dallas</surname><given-names>Sarah L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Bonewald</surname><given-names>Lynda F.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">The osteocyte was thought to be a passive cell, but in the last decade it has been shown to have many functions, such as regulation of bone formation and resorption, generation of endocrine factors that target kidney and muscle and mechanotransduction (reviewed in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>). Today it is accepted that the osteocyte, the most abundant cell in bone, is a key player in bone regulation and adaptation to loading or unloading.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> Based on recent research, new drugs are being developed such as anti-sclerostin antibody that appears promising in animal models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and is now being tested in humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> Other factors made by osteocytes, which are the focus for therapeutics, are RANKL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and FGF23.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup></p><p id="Par4">In contrast to osteoblasts and osteoclasts, there are very few Cre animal models targeting osteocytes specifically.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> The first osteocyte-selective cis regulatory region used to target osteocytes and late osteoblasts was Dentin Matrix Protein-1 (Dmp1) based on the studies of Yang and colleagues on the 10, 8, and 2.5&#x02009;kb promoter regions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> The Dmp1-Cre mouse model was developed by these same investigators using the 10&#x02009;kb fragment of the Dmp1 promoter (&#x02212;9&#x000a0;624-&#x02009;+&#x02009;4&#x000a0;439).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> Cre activity was determined using a Rosa26R reporter mouse in which LacZ expression is activated following excision of a stop cassette. Reporter expression was mainly observed in osteocytes with low expression in osteoblasts. However, when this mouse was crossed with the Ai9 mouse in which the recombination event causes activation of tdTomato fluorescent protein (Jackson Labs), fluorescence was detected in several other tissues including muscle, brain, kidney, and the majority of osteoblasts on the bone surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> Gorski and colleagues found that the Cre recombination in muscle was dependent on the animal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> Unintended targeting of Dmp1-Cre showed an effect on the gastrointestinal mesenchyme.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> It is not clear why this variability in Cre activation occurs but it may be due to mouse strain and/or spontaneous activation during various stages of development.</p><p id="Par5">Other attempts have been made to produce a more osteocyte specific Cre mouse model using the 8&#x02009;kb Dmp1 promoter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> However, in this mouse, Cre activity was observed on endocortical and cancellous surfaces of bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> To avoid non-specific activity of Dmp1-Cre in developmental stages, a tamoxifen-inducible Cre was generated in which a mutated estrogen ligand-binding domain was used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> In this mouse model, some spontaneous (non-tamoxifen induced) Cre activity was observed in osteocytes, but not in osteoblasts. Low tamoxifen targeted mainly osteocytes while high tamoxifen levels also activated Cre in osteoblasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> No activity was observed in muscle, perhaps because of no expression during developmental stages.</p><p id="Par6">Other osteocyte selective markers in addition to Dmp1 have been identified, including Phex, E11/gp38, Mepe, FGF23, and Sost.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> Dmp1, Phex, and E11 are mainly expressed in early osteocytes while Mepe, FGF23, and Sost are expressed in mature osteocytes.

As there is a critical need for additional osteocyte selective Cre models, we focused on creating a new Cre ER<sup>T2</sup> model, driven by the Sost promoter. Our hypothesis was that Sost ER<sup>T2</sup> Cre would be expressed only in mature osteocytes in bone and not in other tissues and therefore would be useful for future research targeting osteocyte expression and functions.

The characteristic arrangement of muscle fibers (i.e., polygonal shaped fibers, relatively small variation in size, peripheral nuclei, and scant endomyosial collagen) was disrupted in Sost-CreER<sup>T2</sup> compared with control. The Sost-CreER<sup>T2</sup> muscles appeared myopathic, particularly in males. By H&#x00026;E staining, most of the muscle cellular nuclei in Sost-CreER<sup>T2</sup> were centralized, and muscle fibers appeared more scattered, rounded, and grouped with significantly more collagen indicating fiber replacement by fibrosis; all key characteristics of myopathy. Normally with myopathy, fibers show atrophy; however, in this case, perhaps in adaptation to the overall muscle hypertrophy, the muscle fibers are not atrophic, particularly in the SOL muscle.

These changes would be expected to contribute to reduced force generation based on the presence of more slow-twitch (oxidative) fiber types, which have slower speeds of contraction and thus overall lower force/power outputs. A similar trend is also observed in the SOL muscles, where in general there seems to be more MHC type I muscle fibers in the Sost-CreER<sup>T2</sup> muscles with the SOL male muscles also displaying a few red MHC type IIb (fast twitch, glycolytic) muscle fibers. While the few IIb could increase force output, very likely the other structural changes, such as those indicating higher amounts of collagen, might also account for the overall force decrement.</p><p id="Par39">Concerning muscle function, differences in absolute and specific force produced at different frequencies of stimulation of EDL and SOL muscles for 3 and 6 month old males and females are shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>.

Our hypothesis was that Sost ER<sup>T2</sup> Cre would be expressed only in osteocytes in bone and not in other tissues to any significant extent. The specificity of this mouse model was impressive with regards to targeting the mature osteocyte. No activation was ever observed in muscle, bone marrow, or bone surface cells. Spontaneous activation of Cre in the absence of tamoxifen only occurred in a few mature osteocytes in bone. With tamoxifen injection, this specificity was still mainly targeted to osteocytes, however, a small amount of off target activity was observed in a few cells in the retina, heart, brain, and kidney. Similar to other studies, we did not observe any sclerostin protein expression in these tissues compared to the high expression in osteocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> Therefore, compared to other Cre models used for targeting osteocytes, this Cre model has a very high specificity for the mature osteocyte.</p><p id="Par43">This goal of generating an osteocyte specific targeted Cre was accomplished but as frequently occurs with transgenic mouse models, an unexpected phenotype was observed. By X-ray and micro CT no significant differences were observed in bone parameters between Cre positive and Cre negative mice.

By 8&#x02013;10 months, the muscle phenotype was obvious in Sost ER<sup>T2</sup> Cre males and by 12 months in females. Even though a visual difference in the intact animals or their muscle appearance was not obvious at 6 months, when excised, the muscles were larger and abnormalities were evident based on histology and fiber typing. Functional studies showed that the muscles for the Cre positive mice were considerably weaker than controls.</p><p id="Par44">Careful systematic analyses of the Sost ER<sup>T2</sup> Cre mice revealed a pattern compatible with development of partial muscle myopathy.

The larger muscles did not translate into improved muscle function, and in fact, normalized forces taking into account muscle size over a wide range of frequencies of stimulation were reduced in the Sost ER<sup>T2</sup> Cre of both genders in both EDL and SOL muscles, demonstrating that the myopathy-like phenotype impaired the force generating capacity of the contractile machinery. This is yet another example that muscle size is not the most reliable parameter for muscle related studies, but rather muscle quality, and the need to always match muscle size to function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> It is interesting that these muscles share some similarities between regenerating muscle fibers and dystrophic muscle fibers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> Our RNA-Seq data is supportive of these ideas. Dystrophin expression was reduced (approximately 30 fold decrease in males and 2.5 fold decrease in females) and the observed phenotype seems to mimic the absence of dystrophin in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. The loss of dystrophin would invariably make skeletal muscles more fragile and more prone to damage. This damage may lead to inflammatory responses as well as to muscle trying to generate new muscle fibers. We observed significant expression of inflammatory genes which could be the underlying cause leading to the muscle remodeling and myopathy. A significant overexpression of myh8, a perinatal isoform of MHC as well as mhc3, an embryonic isoform, was also observed. These MHC isoforms normally re-express in regenerating muscles.</p><p id="Par46">Intriguingly, <italic>MUSK</italic> (Muscle Associated Receptor Tyrosine Kinase), a gene that plays essential functions in the maintenance of the neuromuscular junction is equally down-regulated in both male and females. Mutations in this gene associate with congenital Myasthenia Gravis. It is also interesting to note that there were lower levels of myostatin and FKBP5 (leading to calcineurin activation) which can lead to muscle growth. One possibility would be that reduced MUSK and dystrophin expression lead to remodeling of the muscle and adaptations of growth to compensate, but these changes ultimately lead to myopathy. It remains to be determined the molecular mechanisms that induce these changes and how they interplay together to lead to the muscle phenotype.</p><p id="Par47">It is also intriguing that in older Sost ER<sup>T2</sup> Cre mice reaching their middle age (10&#x02013;12 months), there seems to be a natural protection against fat accumulation, while muscle size still appears to be macroscopically larger, perhaps a reflection of lipid and insulin signaling regulatory changes. It might be interesting to determine if the myopathy persists during aging and if these larger (but disturbed, myopathic) muscles confer any protection against sarcopenia and osteopenia.</p><p id="Par48">In summary, a novel inducible Cre model has been generated for targeting osteocytes, the Sost ER<sup>T2</sup> Cre. This model shows high specificity for osteocytes. However, a low level of spontaneous Cre activation was seen that increased with age, but only in osteocytes. A muscle phenotype was also observed that increased with aging. Care should be exercised when using this model and the muscle phenotype taken into consideration for any future studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials And Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Generation of mice</title><p id="Par8">In the Cre-ER<sup>T</sup> system, the Cre recombinase sequence is fused with a mutated ligand-binding domain from the progesterone or estrogen receptor (ER).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> This modified ligand-binding domain becomes localized to the nucleus in the presence of synthetic steroids, such as tamoxifen or 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen.

bleeding. We describe the case of a 64-year-old man who came to the emergency
room due to acute heart failure and intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding.
Treatment involves initial correction of anemia and heart failure followed by
aortic valve replacement. The prosthesis used depends on the characteristics of
each patient and valve replacement allows the resolution of bleeding in most
cases. Gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with aortic stenosis is associated
with severity of the valve obstruction. A mechanical prosthesis was used with no
recurrent bleeding even with the need for lifelong anticoagulation therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Aortic Valve Stenosis</kwd><kwd>Heart Valve Prosthesis</kwd><kwd>Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage</kwd><kwd>Anemia</kwd><kwd>Heart Failure</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><table-wrap id="t1" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="5%" span="1"/><col width="95%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" style="background-color:#e6e7e8" rowspan="1">Abbreviations,

the consequent population aging. In developed countries, it is the most common
primary valvopathy. The prevalence of severe AS is 1-2% at the age of 75 years,
rising to 6% at 85 years<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.
Critical AS may present with syncope, angina and dyspnea, and risk factors are
similar to those for atherosclerosis<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. In 1958, Heyde described an association between AS and
gastrointestinal hemorrhage<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>,
which was later studied and understood<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. We present a case of Heyde syndrome treated by conventional
surgery and mechanical prosthesis implantation with a satisfactory evolution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>CASE REPORT</title><p>A trader, hypertensive, diabetic, and ex-smoker 64-year-old man, with chronic atrial
fibrillation, had a history of previous stroke (occurring in January 2017), being
discharged from the hospital after one month. Soon after discharge, he came to the
emergency room with lower limb edema and dyspnea at rest (beginning 20 days after
discharge), with progressive worsening and orthopnea. He also reported occasional
episodes of melena of varying intensity.</p><p>An echocardiogram was performed, which identified a severe AS, with aortic valve
presenting gross calcifications of the leaflets, reduction of mobility, valve area
of 0.6 cm<sup>2</sup>, maximum and medium gradient of 60 and 36.5 mmHg,
respectively, and ejection fraction of 67% (Teichholz method). Angiocoronography
showed a 40% obstruction in the right coronary artery. As the digestive hemorrhage
persisted, the patient underwent an enteroscopy that evidenced the presence of
angiodysplasias in the jejunum.</p><p>Based on the clinical findings, the diagnosis of Heyde syndrome was then made. The
patient received clinical treatment for acute heart failure and anemia, then he was
submitted to surgery for conventional aortic valve replacement, with a mechanical 23
mm optimized double leaflet prosthesis, in January 2018. He was extubated four days
after surgery. However, there was an extubation failure due to pneumonia and a
tracheostomy was performed. Acute renal injury also occurred in the early days after
surgery. The patient improved and was discharged from the intensive care unit on the
17<sup>th</sup> postoperative day. After the surgery, there were no new episodes
of digestive hemorrhage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Heyde syndrome is the association of AS with gastrointestinal bleeding due to
gastrointestinal angiodysplasia. In a series of cases with 50 patients with
severe-to-moderate AS, about 20% of them had some type of preoperative
bleeding<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The clinical presentation with digestive hemorrhage is related to the type 2A
acquired von Willebrand syndrome that occurs in these patients<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. The passage of von Willebrand
factor (vWF) by valve stenosis causes the proteolysis of its high-molecular-weight
multimers by a proteinase that acts preferentially under high shear stress
situations, called ADAMTS 13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a
thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13)<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Previous studies have shown that there is an inverse
relationship between the mean aortic transvalvar gradient and the percentage of
high-molecular-weight multimers of vWF in the circulation<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. The vWF is secreted by the endothelium and its
multimers are important for adequate platelet-mediated hemostasis when they bind to
platelet glycoprotein Ib<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>A possible explanation for the emergence of gastrointestinal angiodysplasias is that
severe AS may be associated with a decrease in gastrointestinal perfusion with
consequent dilation of blood vessels by hypoxemia, leading to fixed vasodilation,
the origin of angiodysplasia<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.
Another theory is that mucosal hypoxia might be caused by cholesterol emboli from
the aortic valve or by the altered pulse waveform in AS. Angiodysplasia have been
described in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, in which the alteration of the pulse
waveform is also found<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Angiodysplasias may occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract, but they are more
common in the ascending colon, particularly the caecum<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. A total of 1-6% of in-patient gastrointestinal
bleedings are caused by angiodysplasias, while 30-40% of gastrointestinal bleedings
of an obscure source are found to be linked to angiodysplasia and it is possibly the
most common cause of lower gastrointestinal bleeding in the elderly<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>It is well stablished that the best treatment in such cases is aortic valve
replacement. It has been shown that there is a significant increase in the
percentage of the high-molecular-weight multimers of vWF in the first hours after
surgery, thus limiting the risk of further hemorrhage<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>, a potentially serious complication in the
postoperative period. However, it has been demonstrated that in the presence of
prosthesis-patient disproportion, also called mismatch (valve area less than 0.85
cm<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup> at the echocardiogram), recurrent gastrointestinal
bleeding occurs due to the maintenance of the pathophysiological
mechanism<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. It has been
proposed that guidelines for the management of AS should have bleeding from
intestinal angiodysplasia with demonstrable acquired type 2A von Willebrand syndrome
added as an indicator for valve replacement, and monitoring the severity of the
syndrome should be considered as one of the factors determining the timing for
surgery<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Another point to be debated is the best type of prosthesis to be implanted. The
choice should consider the characteristics of each patient. Figuinha et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> and many other
authors affirm that the prosthesis of choice is biological in all cases of Heyde
syndrome, possibly due to the reduced risks of hemorrhagic postoperative
complications. However, in this case, the patient would already require
anticoagulation due to chronic atrial fibrillation with previous embolic event. Even
with anticoagulation therapy, that started in the second day after surgery, there
was no bleeding, which might be highlighted. So, it indicates that the correct
understanding of the pathophysiology positively influences the choice of
treatment.</p><p>Although the surgery was uncomplicated, the morbidity was not negligible due to
postoperative complications. Thus, a transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)
could have been proposed. Since the first clinical report in 2002, TAVI has emerged
as a valuable, less invasive and safe therapeutic alternative in patients with
severe AS<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>, but it is not
performed in the Brazilian Public Health System yet. Currently, the great advantage
of TAVI over conventional valve replacement is the decrease in morbidity and
mortality rates, especially for high-risk patients.</p><p>AS has a high prevalence rate today due to an increase in population life expectancy
and its association with gastrointestinal bleeding, the so-called Heyde syndrome,
may be more frequent than presently assumed. Therefore, physicians should be aware
of this type of clinical presentation, since the presence of digestive hemorrhage
may be associated with hemodynamically important valve stenosis. When choosing the
type of prosthesis, cardiac surgeons must consider the special characteristics of
each patient. A very different aspect in this case is that a mechanical valve was
selected and there was no bleeding recurrence even with the need for lifelong
anticoagulation therapy.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="10%" span="1"/><col width="90%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">LRG</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Substantial contributions to the

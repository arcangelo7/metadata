treatment of coronary artery disease. Like every interventional procedure, some
complications may arise even if the operator experience is sufficient during the
CAG. Femoral arteriovenous fistula (AVF) rates varying between 0-0.08% have been
reported in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Arteriovenous fistula
can be caused by simultaneous drilling of both arteries and veins by needle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). Other adverse events after CAG include
hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, dissection, embolism, infection, and extremity pain.</p><p>

</p><p>Murmur and stiffness can be detected on the intervention site on physical examination
of AVFs. Diagnosis is mostly done with doppler ultrasonography (DUS) and angiography
is used for definitive diagnosis.</p><p>Iatrogenic AVFs can be treated endovascularly and surgically. Endovascular methods
have advantages such as early mobilization, short hospital stay and less risk of
infection. If AVFs are not treated, they can cause cardiac insufficiency, edema and
ischemia according to size and duration of shunt.</p></sec><sec><title>CASE REPORT</title><p>A 59-year-old male patient had no complaints about AVF previously. His medical
history includes hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, 4 CAGs, and a coronary
artery bypass graft surgery six years ago. In 2016, the latest history of CAG was
available. During the examination for the fifth angiogram, DUS was performed on the
leg with slight edema and murmur present on the previous CAG procedure site. An AVF
was detected, between the right superficial femoral artery and superficial femoral
vein with a diameter of about 3 mm in the DUS.</p><p>After consultation of interventional radiology, endovascular treatment was decided.
Under local anesthesia, the right femoral artery was reached, and the right lower
extremity angiograms were obtained after appropriate manipulations. A fistula was
located between the superficial femoral arter and the superficial femoral vein
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). The femoral vein was reached
after passing through the fistula tract. The catheter was then withdrawn slowly to
try to embolize with cyanoacrylate (glue). However, the glue could not be stabilized
due to the high flow. Although the balloon catheter was inflated for a long period
with low pressure in the fistula region, the flow to the vein via fistula could not
be prevented. Then, the patient was informed about the endovascular stent. However,
the patient preferred a surgical intervention instead of stenting.</p><p>
<fig id="f2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Angiographic image of fistula between superficial femoral artery and
superficial femoral vein.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-33-06-0631-g02"/></fig>
</p><p>Common femoral artery, superficial femoral artery and superficial femoral vein were
turned by right inguinal exploration with local anesthesia. An AVF of about 3 mm in
diameter was seen 1 cm distal to the bifurcation. Clamps were placed on the arterial
and venous sides and the fistula tract was cut from the center. Both vascular
structures, first by the artery, were repaired by 6/0 prolene. The postoperative
murmur disappeared and no fistula tract was seen in DUS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In parallel with the increasing number of CAG procedures in recent years, the number
of complications has also increased. The number of puncture interventions, the
posterior arterial wall penetration and the bigger size of punching needle increase
the AVF formation after CAG<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. It has been reported that properly performed
vascular interventions, appropriate adjustment of anticoagulation and controlled
blood pressure decrease the risk of fistula<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In this case, the administration of large number of CAGs can be cited as the reason
for the AVF. It was decided that an AVF of 3 mm in diameter should be treated even
if asymptomatic, because progressive heart failure or limb ischemia might occur in
late period. In the literature, it is stated that venous ulcer that doesn't heal,
pigmentation, varicose enlargement due to prolonged AVF occurs and venous
insufficiency and heart failure treatment are given to the
patient<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. </p><p>Although there are no clear criteria in treatment approach, endovascular or surgical
intervention should be considered for symptomatic patients, in cases of high-flowed
heart failure and AVFs not self-closing within the first year<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. It is also present in
studies that one third of the iatrogenic AVFs spontaneously shut down within the
first year<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. </p><p>In our study, we identified endovascular methods because of their advantages as the
primary method for AVF closure. Because of the high flow on the fistula, the glue
escaped to the venous system and prevented the AVF closure. Directly opening the
fistula tract to the main vein prevented the application of large amount of glue.
Treatment was terminated because venous thromboembolism could occur with excessive
glue escaping to large veins with no valve structure. Other embolization materials
have not been tested due to high flow.</p><p>An endovascular-coated stent, another treatment option, could be placed. Especially
in the young patient group, we believe that stents in places with high mobility such
as the inguinal region may be a thrombus source. It is also possible that covered
stents placed close to the bifurcation points may close the side branches. In this
case, the patient's opinion was also taken and primary vascular repair was performed
with a skin incision of about 3 cm. As a surgical method, ligation, division and
patch repair methods can be used according to the length of the fistula tract except
for primary closure.</p><p>Surgical access of the lower and upper extremity arteries is easier than
intrathoracic or intraabdominal arteries. We therefore believe that iatrogenic AVFs
in the extremities need to be surgically treated instead of using coated stents.
Surgical treatment is still the golden standard for these cases, as it is the
definitive solution if endovascular procedures cannot be performed.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="05%" span="1"/><col width="95%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1"><bold>Authors&#x02019; roles &#x00026;

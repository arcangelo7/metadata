Specifically, the extent to which patients with diabetes had consultations with registered nurses at the practice level, as opposed to GPs, was examined, and whether there was any association between this and achieving glycaemic control thresholds.</p><boxed-text position="float"><sec><title>How this fits in</title><p>The relationship between nurse staffing and patient outcomes has been extensively explored in acute hospital care, but little research has been undertaken in primary care. A previous study used aggregated practice data and found that general practices employing more practice nurses delivered better care for patients with diabetes. This study goes further by including data on individual patient characteristics and on the consultations undertaken by registered nurses, doctors, and other staff.

Meanwhile the mean proportion of consultations undertaken by nurses in each practice increased slightly (from 31% to 32%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) and those by other healthcare professionals from &#x0003c;3% to 8%. Variation between practices in the use of nurses also increased. In 2002 for practices in the bottom 10% of nurse activity, &#x02264;15% contacts involved a nurse, whereas in the top 10% this rose to &#x0003e;46%. For 2011 it was 15% and 50%, respectively.

Much of the variation between practices in the population achieving glycaemic control is related to differences between the patient populations served.</p><p>As diabetes has become increasingly prevalent, proportionally more care is being delivered and managed by nurses, although the changes have not been as substantial as might have been supposed. The amount of diabetes care delivered by nurses varies substantially between practices from &#x02264;15% of all contacts in the bottom 10% of practices, in terms of nurse activity, to almost a half of all contacts in the top 10%. Patients with diabetes now have fewer consultations per year than in the past, but more of them are undertaken by nurses who provide slightly longer consultations than GPs. Practices in which nurses undertake a higher proportion of consultations with patients with diabetes perform no differently to those in which nurse input is lower.</p><p>In the early part of the decade practices undertaking higher numbers of consultations were less likely to meet the QOF thresholds, suggesting practices may have been &#x02018;playing catch-up&#x02019;. Practices where patients were already meeting QOF thresholds could maintain those levels without increasing their work activity. From the middle of the decade onwards the usual expectation of higher level of work activity and meeting the thresholds took hold.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This study analysed individual patient data from practices that care for 6% of the UK population. Prevalence and consultation rates in this study are similar to those found elsewhere,<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and this provides some validation of the calculations and computations made. A &#x02018;consultation&#x02019; could not be definitively assigned to one member of staff if more than one had made changes to the record(s) associated with that consultation, nor could time be apportioned to individual staff groups if that was the case.</p><p>All types of consultation were used to reflect the total care provided by a practice to patients with diabetes. Focusing on consultations with a diabetes Read Code would have resulted in a high level of data attrition. Care of related complications (for example, hypertension) would have been missed particularly where GPs only code a single comorbidity because of time constraints.</p><p>The accuracy of consultation time is unclear as it relies on practitioners remembering to mark the patient as &#x02018;left&#x02019;. The use of electronic systems was well established in all practices, however there is no reason to assume that errors varied systematically across years.</p><p>A single measure such as HbA1c may not provide an absolute indication of whether a person&#x02019;s diabetes is well controlled or not; meeting HbA1c thresholds was chosen as it has been one of the key QOF diabetes indicators. The cross-sectional analysis did not allow for testing for causality, but, nonetheless, the findings establish that practices that involve nurses more often typically perform as well as those that use nurses less often (in terms of glycaemic control). Practices vary in their availability of resources, for example patient list per nurse and doctor, and the availability of diabetes specialist GP or nurses. It was not possible to consider these practice level contextual factors in the present analysis, although a sub-study based on a survey of 249 practices found no associations between specialist provision and HbA1c level.<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> The richness of the GP patient level data in this study is mirrored by a paucity of good-quality workforce data.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with existing literature</title><p>Specialist nurses or nurse case managers have been shown to be associated with improved short-term diabetic control in a number of trials,<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> and trials have demonstrated that nurse practitioners can achieve outcomes that are equivalent to those of GPs.<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> However, little research has examined the impact of the increased use of nurses in routine general practice outside of these trials. Associations were found previously between higher levels of nurse staffing and better performance measured using QOF diabetes domain score and per cent meeting the lower (&#x02264;57 mmol/mol [7%]) and upper (&#x02264;86 mmol/mol [10%]) HbA1c QOF indicator thresholds for 2005&#x02013;2006<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> using aggregated practice level data only, with no control for individual patient characteristics. The present findings based on 2005 THIN data are consistent with this earlier work. This study provides support for the view that extension of the nursing role would not compromise quality of care or patient outcomes.<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Implications for research and practice</title><p>This study has important implications for policy, practice, and further research. Nurses are well placed to help patients with diabetes make the behavioural changes that can benefit their long-term health. This study shows that there may be considerable scope for increasing the amount of diabetes care that is delivered by nurses, although this would have workforce implications. Some practices may have to employ more nurses to increase capacity to meet the demand. For others, the amount of care delivered by nurses is still low.</p><p>Further evidence is required concerning the long-term costs and benefits of deploying more nurses to undertake diabetes care but the results of this study give no indication that the control of diabetes is worse when more care is provided by nurses. Future research should also consider the preferences of patients with diabetes and a full economic analysis.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Henrietta Mulnier for her work to develop the Read Code classification system of activity, and selection of patients with diabetes from the initial data extract, and Geraldine Lee for support with reviewing the literature in the study.

some conditions, it can be considered difficult to perform, especially in patients
with history of esophagectomy. Currently cardiac surgery is still uncommon after an
esophagectomy, due to the poor prognosis of esophageal cancer. This case report
describes a successful resection of a left atrial myxoma through a right
anterolateral thoracotomy approach in a patient with a previous retrosternal gastric
tube (RGT) reconstruction for adenocarcinoma of esophagogastric junction.</p></sec><sec><title>CASE REPORT</title><p>A 66-year-old male, physician, was admitted to our institute with a left atrial tumor
suggesting a myxoma. He had a history of esophagectomy with retrosternal gastric
tube reconstruction for adenocarcinoma of gastroesophageal junction, twenty years
previously. He was asymptomatic, and the left atrial mass was incidentally
discovered by an echocardiogram study during a preoperative evaluation for an
ophthalmologic procedure. He had a normal physical examination, without heart murmur
or arrhythmia, as well as normal values of laboratory tests.</p><p>Preoperative transthoracic echocardiography showed normal ventricular and mitral
function and a heterogeneous mass in the left atrium attached to the interatrial
septum. A heart magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to establish the
anatomic relations among the heart, the gastric tube and the sternum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). The MRI demonstrated an intracardiac
lobular mass in the left atrium (2-3 cm in size) attached to the left atrial septum,
as well as the relationship between the intrathoracic structures. As it was an
unusual case, this imaging study was crucial in order to make the decision for the
best surgical approach, which was made after a heart surgery team discussion. The
right anterolateral thoracotomy was the approach of choice.</p><p>

</p><p>For surgical access, a right anterolateral thoracic incision was made and the
pectoralis major muscle was divided. After the pleural space opening through the
fourth intercostal space, it was possible to observe the gastric tube adjacent to
the posterior sternum portion, as well as many adherences between the lung and the
gastric tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>). Through cautious
bluntly dissection we have obtained a wide view of the lateral portion of the
pericardium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). About 20 mm anterior
to the right phrenic nerve, a longitudinal pericardium incision was made and it
allowed an adequate exposure of the heart and the great vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>

</p><p>Moderate hypothermic (28&#x000ba;C) cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was established with left
femoral artery cannulation and venous cannulas placed in the superior and inferior
vena cava. The aortic cross-clamping was performed in a standard manner. After the
administration of cardioplegic solution in the aortic root, a longitudinal left
atriotomy was performed with a good exposure of the tumor, which had a macroscopic
aspect of an intracardiac myxoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>).
It was possible to resect the entire tumor without any injury to the interatrial
septum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>). The patient was easily
weaned from CPB and the incision was closed. The CPB and the arterial cross-clamp
times were 40 minutes and 26 minutes, respectively.</p><p>The patient had an uneventful postoperative course, with a length of stay in the
intensive care unit of 36 hours. The predischarge transthoracic echocardiography
demonstrated a normal biventricular function, with a complete resection of the tumor
and an intact interatrial septum. The patient was discharged to home on
postoperative day 5, and the histopathologic exam confirmed the diagnosis of myxoma.
After nineteen months of follow-up, medical surveillance shows no complication

after an esophagectomy with RGT reconstruction - is still rare, and the prognosis of
this entity justifies this condition<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. In these patients,
the presence of a RGT raise concerns about the ideal surgical approach to expose the
heart without any injury to the digestive conduct, which could result in severe
sepsis.</p><p>Although median sternotomy remains the conventional approach in cardiovascular
surgery, alternate incisions for reoperations must be selected to avoid an injury to
the reconstructed gastric tube and the surrounding tissues<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, there are 14 case reports about cardiovascular surgery
in patients with RGT, all related to aorta or valvular surgeries. Our case is the
first about the resection of a left atrial myxoma in a patient with RGT
reconstruction. The approaches reported were median sternotomy, right parasternal
incision and left thoracotomy<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The use of left thoracotomy has been previously reported and recommended for aortic
valve replacement after an esophagectomy with RGT reconstruction<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>, just like the median sternotomy
has been considered a feasible approach of the aortic valve after a careful
examination of the gastric tube and the gastroepiploic artery<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. Gillinov et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> successfully chose the right
parasternal incision for aortic valve replacement in a case with history of
substernal colon interposition. Also, Mazzitelli et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> described a right parasternal approach for aortic
valve replacement, after a retrosternal gastropexy.</p><p>Preoperative imaging exams are essential to decide for the better surgical access.
This decision may be determined by the location of the gastric tube as well as the
position of the gastroepiploic artery, which is responsible for the blood supply of
the digestive conduct<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. Computed tomography is the most
used imaging study in these cases, probably due to its availability. However, MRI
also may be used in preoperative evaluation, as described in this case.</p><p>Since all surgical approaches have advantages and disadvantages, we highlight the
importance of discussion and individualization of the surgical strategy for each
situation.</p><p>Being an unusual case, the discussion about the best and safer surgical approach with
other surgeons was crucial and it promoted the success of the procedure. In the
present case, previous experience and the characteristics of the imaging study
determined the decision.</p><p>With a right anterolateral thoracotomy, it was possible a safe dissection and
retraction of the RGT, assuring excellent exposition of heart and great vessels. The
femoral artery cannulation also contributed to this good surgical view.</p><p>In conclusion, it is possible to say that a right anterolateral thoracotomy is an
applicable and safe approach for treatment of left atrial myxoma in patients with
RGT reconstruction.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>No conflict of interest.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was carried out at the Instituto do Cora&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o do Hospital

MAP4-microtubule binding is regulated through MAP4 phosphorylation, leading to the detachment of MAP4 from microtubules (MTs) and destabilization of the MT as a consequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. We and others have reported that the phosphorylation sites of human MAP4 at S768 and S787 (corresponding to the S737 and S760 in mouse) are critical sites governing its detachment from MTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].

The three proteins were involved in regulating mitochondrial function, and the results indicated that the Mul1 and Ndufs1 protein expression were significantly lower and Gadd45gip1 was higher in MAP4 KI mice compared with WT littermates, which was consistent with the iTRAQ results (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1).

However, the detailed mechanism of how MAP4 phosphorylation triggered the mitochondrial dysfunction was still unclear. In the present study, for the first time, we investigated the DEPs between WT and MAP4 KI mice using iTRAQ-based global proteomics and LC-MS/MS analysis. We identified 72 DEPs in MAP4 KI mice.</p><p id="Par52">In particular, several DEPs involved in mitochondrial dysfunction, which have not been reported correlated with MAP4, were identified and analyzed on the basis of PPI and their characteristics, thereby providing the underlying candidate molecular mechanisms that involved in MAP4 phosphorylation-induced mitochondrial dysfunction.</p><p id="Par53">Further bioinformatics analysis, including GO analysis, KEGG assessment, and PPI were evaluated to reveal the characteristics of DEPs. The GO analysis revealed that cellular process, binding, and cell part were the most abundant categories in BP, MF, and CC, respectively. GTP binding, guanyl ribonucleotide binding, and guanyl nucleotide binding were the three most enriched GO terms. In KEGG analysis, several cardiomyopathy-related pathways, such as dilated cardiomyopathy, metabolic pathways, calcium signaling pathway, adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were detected, indicating that MAP4 phosphorylation may correlate with these diseases. However, the detailed role of MAP4 phosphorylation in such diseases is still unknown.</p><p id="Par54">Mitochondrial dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] has been recognized as one of the most important reasons for the development of cardiomyocyte injury. Our previous work revealed that MAP4 phosphorylation led to cardiomyocyte mitochondrial dysfunction under different stimuli (e.g., hypoxia, ischemia, and transverse aortic constriction) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Here, in the results of KEGG analysis, both metabolic pathway and calcium signaling pathway were tightly correlated with the mitochondrial dysfunction, which may provide fundamental opening and evidence for future studies to reveal the mechanism of MAP4 phosphorylation-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. We also acquired some DEPs with thyroid hormone signaling pathway, adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor signaling pathway, and rap1 signaling pathway. We cannot exclude the possibility that these proteins may be triggers and have a certain capacity to switch on or exaggerate the role of key effector molecules, and further studies should be carried out.</p><p id="Par55">In the current study, three mitochondrial proteins, including Mul1, Gadd45gip1, and Ndufs1, which were involved in the regulation of mitochondrial dysfunction, were chosen from DEPs to validate by WB. Mul1 has been known to be involved in the regulation of multiple proteins, including anti-apoptotic proteins, and is predominantly expressed in mitochondria of heart tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The previous study reported that Mul1 interacted with multiple mitochondrial proteins, and overexpression of Mul1 promoted NF-&#x003ba;B activation, which increased the transcription of anti-apoptotic proteins and exhibited the inhibitory effects on mitochondrial apoptosis of cardiomyocyte, in contrast, the Mul1 inhibition led to susceptibility to mitochondrial apoptosis and dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Ndufs1, the largest subunit of complex 1, which located at the mitochondrial inner membrane. The protein exhibited reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) dehydrogenase activity and oxidoreductase activity, which transferred electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain to exert oxidative phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The mutation or knockdown of Ndufs1 impaired mitochondrial oxygen consumption, increased reactive oxide species production, and decreased oxidative phosphorylation, contributing to progressive mitochondrial dysfunction followed by various diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Gadd45gip1 was newly identified as de novo components in large subunit of mitochondrial ribosome and played an important role in genomic stability, DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. It was widely expressed in the heart, thyroid, and lymph node [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Previous data demonstrated that elevated Gadd45gip1 expression promoted activation of tumor protein p53 (p53), a pro-apoptotical protein, and its target genes in the suppression of cell growth and tumor development in human cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The p53 was a downstream target of p38/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and was known to induce mitochondrial dysfunction of cardiomyocyte upon the activation of p38/MAPK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In our previous study, we have demonstrated that p38/MAPK activation induced MAP4 phosphorylation in cardiomyocyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Thus, we inferred that the MAP4 KI mice-induced increased Gadd45gip1 was also contaminated with p53 activation, which may be a pathway involved in cardiomyocyte mitochondrial dysfunction. Besides, in the DEPs, secretory protein including thrombospondin 1, and transcription factor, such as signal transducer and activator of transcription 1, have been reported to be associated with mitochondrial function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Whether they are associated with the observed changes of the above-mentioned three mitochondrial proteins are still unclear and deserve further research. The other secretory proteins, including immunoglobulin heavy variable 1&#x02013;82, immunoglobulin heavy variable 1&#x02013;26, transforming growth factor beta-1-induced transcript 1 protein, serum amyloid A-2 protein and serum amyloid A-1 protein, and transcription factors, such as NFX1-type zinc finger-containing protein 1 and endothelial differentiation-related factor 1, showed little correlation with cardiac mitochondrial function; while for other transcription factor, such as signal transducer and activator of transcription 1, has been reported to be associated with cardiac mitochondrial function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]; however, the potential effect had little interaction with Mul1, Ndufs1, and Gadd45gip1, the detailed mechanism need to be investigated in future study.</p><p id="Par56">In addition, the PPI analysis also revealed that 14-3-3 protein epsilon (Ywhae), which mediated signal transduction by binding to a multitude of functionally diverse signaling proteins, including phosphoserine-containing proteins, kinases, and transmembrane receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], was the center of the network in mice. In the network, Ywhae directly interacted with MAP4, Gadd45gip1, and Ndufs1, respectively. And Mul1 was interacted with Znfx1, which was also revealed a direct correlation with Ywhae. Furthermore, the protein expression of Mul1, Ndufs1, and Gadd45gip1 were validated by WB, which was consistent with the iTRAQ experiments. Thus, these findings provided a further link between MAP4 and Gadd45gip1, Ndufs1, and Mul1, suggesting possible molecular targets involved in MAP4 phosphorylation-induced cardiomyocyte mitochondrial dysfunction, and these screened DEPs may provide us new directions in mechanism exploration in future studies. Even though there are still some limitations in the present study, the screened proteins involved in mitochondrial function and other cardiac-specific function are limited to only a couple and the extent of change is less than twofold for most of these proteins, so the cause and effect relationship between these proteins and cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction still needs to be demonstrated in future studies. In addition, a relatively small number of DEPs were detected, which may be related to the young mice that we used, if we used elder mice, the phenotypes would be more obvious and the more DEPs may be detected.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par57">In conclusion, iTRAQ proteomic analysis was used to assess the cardiac protein expression profile, and 72 DEPs were detected in MAP4 KI mice, including 12 upregulated and 60 downregulated proteins as compared to WT littermates. GO analysis, KEGG assessment, and PPI analysis were all evaluated to reveal the characteristics of DEPs. And three proteins were chosen to validate, which were possibly correlated with MAP4 phosphorylation-induced cardiomyocyte mitochondrial dysfunction. Further study is warranted to clarify the precise mechanism for MAP4 phosphorylation-induced cardiomyocyte mitochondrial dysfunction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec20"><p>

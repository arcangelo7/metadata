atrial isomerism and a single functional ventricle was admitted to our emergency
department with cyanosis. Emergency cardiac catheterization revealed a large
veno-venous fistula that began in a left hepatic vein, connected to the left
accessory hepatic veins, and drained into the common atrium, resulting in
desaturation. The fistula was occluded proximally with an Amplatzer septal
occluder, with satisfying results; the patient's systemic arterial saturation
decreased during his hospital stay. Three weeks after the first intervention, a
second procedure was performed to retrieve the first device and to close the
fistula distally. Multiple attempts with different types of gooseneck snares and
a bioptome catheter failed to retrieve the first device, so a telescopic method
was used to re-screw it. Using a Mullins long sheath and delivery sheath, the
delivery cable was manipulated to fit into the slot of the end screw, and the
cable was rotated gently in a clockwise direction to re-screw the device. Then,
another Amplatzer septal occluder was placed at the distal end of the fistula.
In conclusion, distal transcatheter occlusion of intrahepatic veno-venous
fistulas might lead to better clinical outcomes in selected patients. Amplatzer
septal occluder device can be retrieve without any complication within three
weeks.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Heart defects, congenital</kwd><kwd>Child</kwd><kwd>Fontan Procedure</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><table-wrap id="t1" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" style="background-color:#e6e7e8"><colgroup span="1"><col width="10%" span="1"/><col width="90%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1">Abbreviations, acronyms &#x00026; symbols</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ASO</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">= Amplatzer septal occluder</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">TAPVC</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">= Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Complex cyanotic congenital cardiac diseases are sometimes not suitable for
biventricular repair<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. The Fontan operation is a good
palliation used in single ventricle physiology to place the systemic and pulmonary
circulations in series. Unfortunately, unexpected cyanosis can occur that is often
caused by decompressing veno-venous collaterals, originating from systemic veins and
draining into the pulmonary veins or the pulmonary venous atrium<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. In patients with visceral
heterotaxy, there are various types of systemic venous connections, such as the
drainage of hepatic veins independently of the inferior vena cava directly into the
common atrium<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. These types of
hepatic venous malformations are seen in 8% of heterotaxy patients undergoing Fontan
procedures<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. Veno-venous
collaterals from the hepatic system to the pulmonary venous atrium have been
described in previous studies, along with techniques to eliminate them<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. Herein, we describe the transcatheter treatment of a patient
with right atrial isomerism and a large venous fistula from a left hepatic vein
connected to the left accessory hepatic veins and drained to the pulmonary venous
atrium, causing desaturation. Ethics board approval is not required for case reports
in our institution.</p></sec><sec><title>CASE</title><p>A 7-year-old male patient diagnosed with right atrial isomerism, unbalanced complete
atrioventricular septal defect, double outlet right ventricle, pulmonary stenosis,
and nonobstructive total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC) draining into
the left superior vena cava was referred to our clinic. His systemic oxygen
saturation was 65-70%. Diagnostic catheterization prior to undergoing a Fontan
operation consisted of angiography and pressure measurements in the pulmonary
arteries. A Fontan operation using a 16 mm extracardiac conduit was performed, along
with TAPVC repair, and the patient's systemic oxygen saturation increased to 90%
after surgery. During outpatient follow-up, the patient's saturation was in the high
80s, but six months after surgery, he was admitted to the emergency department with
cardiac arrest. He was intubated, and despite with adequate ventilation and 100%
FiO<sub>2</sub>, his systemic oxygen saturation was in the lower 30s, and
emergency cardiac catheterization was performed on the same day. Mean Fontan
pressure was 20 mmHg, and bilateral pulmonary venous return appeared appropriate,
with no suggestion of significant pulmonary arteriovenous malformations; no
fenestration was determined. However, an inferior vena cava angiogram revealed that
a left hepatic vein originating from the inferior vena cava divided into multiple
sinusoidal channels in the liver, joining together with the left accessory hepatic
veins and draining into the pulmonary venous atrium. Angiographic visualization of
the lateral tunnel and superior vena cava revealed poor filling of the pulmonary
arteries and rapid retrograde filling of the left inferior caval vein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figures 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">1C</xref>), creating a deviation in
blood flow from the systemic venous return to the common atrium.</p><p><fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>A: Angiogram of the inferior vena cava: a veno-venous malformation

cava pressure decreased to 17 mmHg. An angiogram conducted during the occlusion test
showed better flow to the pulmonary arteries, and systemic oxygen saturation
increased from 30% to 85% (with 100% FiO<sub>2</sub>). The fistula was closed
proximally with a 15 mm Amplatzer septal occluder (ASO) (AGA Medical, Golden Valley,
MN) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Movie-1</xref>).</p><p><fig id="f4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="rbccv-31-02-0174-m01.mp4" orientation="portrait" id="d36e219" position="anchor"/></fig></p><p>The patient was extubated two days after catheterization. His saturation was in the
high 85s, but three weeks after the intervention, while still in the hospital, his
saturation level decreased to 75-80%. An echocardiograph showed no residual flow
through the device, which was attributed to the accessory left hepatic veins
returning to the atrium. Another intervention was planned for a later date, either
transcatheter or surgical, to retrieve the first device and close the major
intrahepatic venovenous fistulas distally.</p><p>The patient was intubated prior to the procedure, and 6F sheaths were placed into the
right jugular vein and femoral vein. Multiple attempts with different types of
gooseneck snares and a bioptome catheter failed to retrieve the first device.
Re-screwing the device was then considered, as the position of the device appeared
favorable for the retrieval. A telescopic method was used to re-screw the device. A
14F Mullins sheath (USCI, Billerica, MA) was placed over the end screw of the ASO
and the tip of the Mullins sheath's dilatator was cut distally, large enough to
enable a 7F JR4 guiding catheter to be advanced through it. Then, the dilatator was
placed at the end screw of the atrial septal defect device through the 14F Mullins
sheath, and the 7F JR4 guiding catheter was advanced through until it met the end
screw of the ASO. Then, the delivery cable was advanced inside the sheath close to
the end screw and it was manipulated to fit into the slot of the end screw. The
cable was rotated gently in a clockwise direction to re-screw the device, and the
device was retrieved, using the 7F JR4 guiding sheath and 14F Mullins sheath's
dilatator in the 14F primary sheath (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>
and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Movie-2</xref>).</p><p><fig id="f2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>A: 14F Mullins long sheath placed over the end screw of the ASO. B and C:

was placed into the atrium through the hydrophilic catheter. A 7F Ansel guiding

veno-venous fistula was closed distally with a 16 mm ASO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Movie-2</xref>). The
patient was extubated one day after the procedure, and systemic oxygen saturation
was 92-93%. Coumadin was initiated after the procedure, and the patient was
discharged one week later. Four months after the procedure, the patient's saturation

systemic veins to the pulmonary veins. This physiology might stimulate the
enlargement of rudimentary embryologic connections from the systemic veins to the
pulmonary veins or the pulmonary venous atrium, which can result in decompressing
veno-venous collaterals and causing desaturation. These collaterals can include left
superior vena cava to coronary sinus, hemiazygos vein entering the left superior
vena cava below the level of a previous ligation, systemic to pulmonary vein
connections, large coronary veins to the pulmonary venous atrium, and hepatic veins
to the pulmonary venous atrium<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>One or more hepatic veins are left connected to the pulmonary venous atrium (called
partial exclusion of hepatic vein) or the inferior vena cava is partitioned, with
the rationale of minimizing hepatic venous congestion, thus decreasing Fontan
pathway volume and pressure load and decreasing serous effusions. This method is
advocated as a fenestration technique that leads to smooth postoperative
recovery<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. However,
intrahepatic connections can develop between the inferior vena cava and the excluded
hepatic vein and result in significant desaturation<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. Proximal transcatheter closure of these fistulas
might appear to be easier, but it excludes the all left hepatic vein from systemic
venous circulation. The use of this technique should probably be restricted to
patients with multiple suprahepatic veins that drain into the common atrium. Distal
occlusion below the common atrium includes the hepatic veins in the Fontan
circulation and limits the development of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations,
however, it is more difficult to achieve and carries the potential risk of migration
into the atrium. Moreover, it is possible to induce the development of other hepatic
veins<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. In the first
intervention in the current case, venous pressure was 17 mmHg after the occlusion
test and systemic oxygen saturation was elevated, so we decided to occlude the
fistula from the proximal part. Unfortunately, however, the patient's saturation
levels dropped continuously during follow-up, so another intervention was performed
to close the fistula distally.</p><p>In routine practice, various techniques using gooseneck snares and bioptomes are used
to retrieve embolized occluders. Snaring may be challenging at times due to
difficulties in catching the retention screw, and the possibility of device
distortion is always present. Moreover, potential damage to the surrounding
structures is a major concern. Surgical retrieval is probably safe in some of these
situations. Re-screwing through wider diameter sheaths is difficult due to problems
with approximation between the retention screw and the delivery cable. A secondary
sheath with a smaller internal diameter might make it difficult to approximate the
retention screw; however, advancing through a larger lumen primary sheath that has
been placed close to the device can easily approximate the retention
screw<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The course of a veno-venous fistula can sometimes be tortuous, causing kinking of the
long sheath and not allowing the device to pass through the sheath. Tofeig et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> overcame this
problem by front-loading the device into a 7F sheath and delivering it through a 10F
long sheath. In a recent report by Kuo<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>, a veno-venous fistula was closed via left transhepatic access.
The femoral approach is also not suitable in most cases, due to the sharp angle
between the inferior vena cava and the hepatic fistula. In our case, we preferred
the transjugular approach using a kink-resistant hydrophilic long sheath.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, unexpected desaturation after a Fontan operation in patients with
heterotaxy should prompt suspicion of the presence of an intrahepatic veno-venous
fistula that developed from an accessory hepatic vein connected to the common
atrium. Distal transcatheter occlusion of intrahepatic veno-venous fistulas might
lead to better clinical outcomes in selected patients. ASO device can be retrieved
without any complication within three weeks.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="10%" span="1"/><col width="90%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">AG</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Conception and design, manuscript writing or critical review of its

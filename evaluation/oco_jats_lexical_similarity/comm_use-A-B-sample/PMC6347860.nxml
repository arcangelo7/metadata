Global targets to reduce physical inactivity by 10% by 2025 and 15% by 2030 have been set.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
</p><p>There is no single or simple solution to the complex problem of physical inactivity. Best investments to increase levels of PA have been described, working in partnership and across sectors that include (1) communication and public education, (2) urban design and infrastructure, (3) sport and recreation, and (4) community programmes.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref>
</p><p>One initiative that may contribute to addressing physical inactivity is using golf tournaments. Professional golf tournaments draw over 10 million spectators per year.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The best available evidence suggests that golf spectators report &#x02018;exercise/physical activity&#x02019; and &#x02018;potential health benefits gained&#x02019; as considerations in attending professional golf tournaments.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;13</xref> In golf, unlike many other sports where spectators are seated, spectators often walk portions of the course when watching the action.</p><p>Collaborations between The European Tour, The R&#x00026;A, The World Golf Foundation and academic institutions have been established to promote PA at golf tournaments which include some of the biggest male (the Open Championship, the Ryder Cup) and female (Women&#x02019;s British Open) golf events globally. Our previous research has highlighted that tournament spectators can gain health-enhancing PA. Our previous study showed that 84.7% of participating spectators achieved their daily recommended PA, when measured by step count, while spectating.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</p><p>However, the overall public health benefit of a single day of spectating even for 10 million persons is modest.

Thus, comparisons will be made with a broader evidence base.</p><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Knowledge and attitudes relating to PA for health</title><p>Previous research from this golf spectator cohort discovered that they have high habitual levels of PA compared with the general population.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> We speculate that many golf spectators are likely to be golfers themselves and thus are more likely to be regularly physically active. Spectating at golf tournaments does offer spectators the opportunity to move around and follow play from a variety of locations.

Sixty-eight per cent of respondents reported that information received at the golf tournament had helped increase their knowledge in this area. While they may not be fully representative of all spectators at this and other golf tournaments, it would appear that some spectators can be positively engaged in learning about PA for health.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Influencing PA levels</title><p>In total, 65.1% of our sample indicated that receiving information relating to active spectating had influenced them to consider being more active in everyday life. Even for those meeting the minimum guidelines for PA, greater health and well-being benefits can be gained by doing more, for most people. Using Prochaska and Di Clemente&#x02019;s stages of change/trans-theoretical model,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17 20</xref> these persons can be represented as being in the &#x02018;contemplative&#x02019;, &#x02018;preparation&#x02019; or &#x02018;action&#x02019; phase when surveyed.</p><p>Over two-fifths (40.4%) of respondents in the present study self-report positive behaviour change in increasing PA at 3 months post intervention. The magnitude of increase was not assessed so as to maximise participation (minimise participant burden). These persons can be represented as being in the &#x02018;action&#x02019; phase when surveyed. Maintaining improved PA levels would provide longevity, physical and mental health benefits to people and populations.</p><p>With many spectators contemplating, preparing to take action, or taking action to increase PA, interventions at tournaments have the potential to be a teachable moment aimed to move participants further along the cycle of change, and positively influence PA knowledge, and achieved PA. We underscore that it is not clear whether the sample who responded to our survey are representative of other spectators at this, or other golf events. Nevertheless, there is an important proportion of golf spectators whose knowledge and behaviours can be positively influenced.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>Providing PA information and intervention to spectators</title><p>To increase PA generally,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> and more specifically to achieve a legacy after a major sporting event,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 24</xref> strategy and collaboration are required.

Both these methods likely offer value, as printed material can be tailored to appeal across a range of stages of change, while spectators welcome the engagement of the big screen/billboard.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Implications and recommendations for research, policy and practice</title><p>Studies of spectator populations at other tournaments are likely to be influenced by factors including, but not limited to, cultural factors, type of tournament, engagement of player ambassadors and local facilities for PA. Thus, while further larger research studies may seem attractive, small-scale implementation followed by pragmatic evaluation and the implementation of improvement and, if appropriate, scale-up science may offer more value. Broad principles will apply, but the detail is likely to be different based on many factors and a pragmatic approach may be best.</p><p>Governing bodies for sport, golf promoters and marketeers can be encouraged to collaborate with leading players, PA experts and a range of other stakeholders to encourage practices and policies that promote walking at the event,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26 27</xref> but also using the &#x02018;teachable moment&#x02019; of attendance at tournaments to impact knowledge around physical activity and encourage positive health behaviour change. This could improve public health for fans and communities, and need not be limited to increasing PA, but also support healthy eating, sustainable transport, wearing sunscreen and so on.</p><p>Golf spectating does offer an opportunity for PA in this particular setting and population. Attendance can be encouraged, and spectators can actively be supported to engage in PA through promotional efforts ahead of and during each professional golf event.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Fans/spectators can receive public health benefits, while tournament organisers/sponsors may find revenue and corporate and social responsibility benefits. Collaborations thus far have produced interventions at leading tournaments worldwide including the Ryder Cup, the Open Championship, The Women&#x02019;s British Open, the Shenzhen Open (China), Indonesia Open and Andaluc&#x000ed;a Masters (Spain) among others. Potential benefits of promoting PA for spectators at events are shown in <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Potential benefits of promoting physical activity for spectators at events</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Members of public/spectators</td><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Tournament promoters</td><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Government/local authority</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Individual health and well-being</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Increased volume of spectators&#x02014;revenue<break/>Corporate and social responsibility</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Legacy from event<break/>Public health and well-being</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This study was pragmatic in its approach.</p><p>Strengths include building on the existing literature and frameworks to describe an innovative approach to engage with spectators at a major sporting event. Those study participants reported an increased awareness of PA benefits, and in some cases increases in reported PA levels. Although further study is required, we discovered that attendance at a golf tournament could present a teachable moment, and that there are potential untapped public health benefits related to major sporting events. This study demonstrated that over 40% of those eligible returned completed questionnaires via email and that conducting research following up spectators from sporting events is feasible. It also describes the value of co-production/collaboration which will support improvement of interventions and scale-up where relevant.</p><p>Limitations are apparent. While all those who agreed to take part were emailed and sent a reminder, those who completed the survey may be a unique subset, potentially more interested in PA than those who did not return correspondence leading to potential selection bias. Individuals were aware that they were taking part in a study and may have changed their behaviours recognising they were being observed (Hawthorne effect). Twenty-four persons supplied email addresses that failed to deliver or were illegible, while an unknown number may have ended up in &#x02018;spam&#x02019; folders. While the tournament took place in August, follow-up was in October onwards, when weather conditions and other factors may affect people&#x02019;s motivation and ability to achieve PA. No objective measures of PA levels beyond the event were captured. The sample size and other limitations limit generalisability, particularly recognising the worldwide distribution of golf tournaments and significant differences in culture/context.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Post intervention, many golf spectators contemplated increasing PA in daily life while close to half of this sample self-report having actually increased PA. Spectators&#x02019; preferred method for receiving information on PA benefits, and how this can be achieved is via the big screens erected at major tournaments.</p><p>Public education interventions at golf tournaments may benefit spectators&#x02019; individual health and well-being, while local authorities may see a contribution to public health and well-being. Tournament promoters may attract an increased volume of spectators, while interventions can help achieve company corporate and social responsibilities.</p><p>These data are presented with caution, recognising that while the findings are novel and point to potential exciting opportunities to deliver to the WHO&#x02019;s agenda of increasing PA, those responding to the survey may not be fully representative of spectators at golf tournaments.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank Paths for All, the European Tour Golf and 4Sports for their input and collaboration at the Paul Lawrie Matchplay tournament.

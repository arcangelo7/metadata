tachycardia (AT). It often presents as incessant tachycardia, which easily mediates
cardiomyopathy. And it&#x02019;s always refractory to drugs. Meanwhile, tachycardia from LAA
presents a unique challenge for successful ablation because of special anatomical
location. In this report, we describe an ablation for AT originating from LAA curing
an early pregnant woman without fluoroscopy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>CASE REPORT</title><p>A 29-year-old woman was admitted with a 2-week history of progressive paroxysmal
palpitations accompanied by persistent chest tightness and dyspnea. She had no other
medical history. During her 3 years of marriage, she had encountered difficulty
achieving pregnancy naturally. When admitted, she was in the 11<sup>th</sup> week of
gestation following in vitro fertilization. Physical examination revealed a pulse of
167 beats per minute (bpm), regular heart rhythm, clear heart sounds with no
pathological murmur and no lower limb edema. Auxiliary examinations included a
12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) which showed AT at 150 bpm with a negative
<italic>P</italic>-wave in leads I, aVL and aVR, as well as a positive
<italic>P</italic>-wave in leads II, III, aVF and V<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure1A</xref>), and an echocardiogram which revealed
an LA of 42mm (anteroposterior diameter), left ventricular end-diastolic dimension
(LVEDD) of 55mm and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 48%. She was found
to be euthyroid and her N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide level was 4285
pg/ml. The patient was diagnosed with atrial tachyarrhythmia. An esophageal lead was
applied to confirm the diagnosis, but rapid pacing failed to terminate it. Rest ECG
showed a rate of 110 to 120 bpm. Slight movement, such as eating or going to the
toilet, caused her heart rate to exceed 150 bpm. Intravenous administration of
propafenone transiently converted the tachycardia to sinus rhythm but could not
sustain. Other medications such as metoprolol could not adequately control the heart
rate either.</p><p>
<fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>A) Surface ECG shows narrow QRS and long RP tachycardia, with frequency
of 150 bpm. It notes the upright P-wave in leads II, III and aVF,
inverted P-wave in leads I and aVL, and an upright P-wave in lead V1. B)

ms. The activation sequence of mapping electrode in CS reveals the

</p><p>Ablation was performed under local anesthesia, Multichannel EP recorder (EP
MedSystems, USA) and three-dimensional (3D) electroanatomic mapping system
(CartoSound, Biosense Webster, CA, USA). The patient still exhibited tachycardia
while undergoing the procedure. The right femoral vein was cannulated using an
8French (F) sheath, through which a saline infusion ablation catheter (ThermoCool
Electrophysiology Catheter, Biosense Webster, CA, USA) was introduced into the right
atrium (RA). A detailed electro-anatomic map of the RA and coronary sinus (CS) were
created using fast anatomical mapping (FAM). Then the right internal jugular vein
was cannulated using a 6F sheath through which a decapolar EP catheter (Rithm ID,
Synaptic Medical, CN) was introduced into the CS under the guidance of the
electro-anatomic map. The intracardiac electrogram showed a cycle length of 330-370
msec and CS activation order of CS<sub>1,2</sub> earlier than CS<sub>9,10</sub>
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure1B</xref>), which confirmed the AT
originating from the LA. Then the right femoral vein was cannulated using a 10F
sheath and an 8.5F long sheath, through which an EP catheter (SoundStar, Biosense
Webster, CA, USA) was introduced and a transseptal needle (St. Jude Medical, USA)
was applied to perform transseptal puncture under CartoSound guidance. Four thousand
units of unfractionated heparin were administered intravenously with access to LA to
maintain an active clotting time of approximately 350 seconds. The ablation catheter
and a circular decapolar catheter (Lasso, Biosense Webster, CA, USA) were introduced
into the LA via the transseptal site. A detailed electro-anatomic map of LA was
created and clearly demonstrated focal activation originating from the very distal
LAA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure2</xref>). There was no evidence of
macro-reentry. Radiofrequency (RF) ablation was performed using 20 watts, titrating
up to 25 watts, for approximately 16 times (power control mode, 40&#x02103;, 30cc/min). Each
time, ablation energy was delivered for 6-10 seconds. Ablation at this site
terminated the tachycardia with no recurrence noted during a 30-minute observation
period. No tachycardia was induced by programmed stimulation and rapid atrial
pacing. The procedure lasted for 2.5 hours with no fluoroscopy and without
complications.</p><p>

</p><p>At the 1-month follow-up visit, the ECG showed normal sinus rhythm and the
echocardiogram showed LA of 30 mm, LV of 48 mm, LVEF of 52%. Three months after the
procedure, a 24-hour Holter exam revealed sinus rhythm with 7987 atrial premature
beats and 903 episodes of paroxysmal AT (8.1% of the day). And the patient
complained of occasional palpitations. Six months later, a 24-hour Holter exam
conducted showed sinus rhythm with 37 atrial premature beats and 5 episodes of
paroxysmal AT (0.06% of the day). A healthy baby boy was eventually delivered by
Cesarean section. No palpitations were reported thereafter.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>AT is a relatively rare supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with a reported prevalence
of 5-10%. Focal atrial tachycardia can arise from various portions of the atrium.
These include the crista terminalis, around or inside the CS, near or inside the
pulmonary veins, superior vena cava, atrial septum, and Koch&#x02019;s triangle. LAA
tachycardia is uncommon, accounting for only 3% of all focal AT. And AT originating
from LAA is likely to become persistent<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. This patient&#x02019;s initial presentation was
due to cardiomyopathy secondary to persistent tachycardia. Meanwhile, it has been
reported that the recurrence rate of this kind of AT is as high as
30%<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. No data exists regarding incidence, ablation
therapy or prognosis of AT originating from the LAA in pregnant women. Review of the
literature showed that in 2015<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>, among 27 cases of ablation therapy performed
for arrhythmias during pregnancy, two cases of AT originating from the right atrial
appendage were treated operatively under x-ray guidance. No cases of AT originating
from the LAA were described.</p><p>As persistent tachycardia reduces mother&#x02019;s cardiac output, the resulting decrease in
uteroplacental perfusion raises the likelihood of fetal distress and developmental
retardation. Physical therapy, such as esophageal pacing and electrical
cardioversion, is simple and repeatable, but has limited efficiency and is
associated with high rates of recurrence. All antiarrhythmic drugs pose risks of
fetal adverse effects or teratogenicity. Therefore, definitive therapy for these
patients, either with catheter ablation or drug therapy, is usually deferred until
the postpartum period. In fact, the American College of Cardiology and American
Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines recommend that ablation be considered in
pregnant women with drug-refractory, poorly-tolerated SVTs. RF catheter ablation is
effective, but the associated radiation also has teratogenic
effects<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. In recent years, with the use of 3D-mapping
systems, RF catheter ablation without fluoroscopy has brought new hope to special
patients, such as pregnant women and children.</p><p>Electroanatomic navigation systems can comfortably depict the activation of all
chambers mapped and allow reproducible ablation catheter repositioning at the &#x0201c;spot
of interest&#x0201d;. In this case report, we have described ablation under CartoSound
system. The CartoSound system provided a considerably safer and more efficient
technique compared with conventional methods. The procedure included a double
transseptal puncture, activation mapping and successful ablation of a LAA focal
tachycardia. All of these were performed without any fluoroscopy. To the best of our
knowledge, this report is the first to describe LAA ablation performed in a pregnant
patient without fluoroscopy.</p><p>We conclude that catheter ablation may be safely and successfully performed using the
CartoSound 3D-mapping system guidance without radiation in special groups. Catheter
ablation therefore should be considered for these patients with arrhythmias
refractory to medical therapy.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="5%" span="1"/><col width="95%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Author's roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">WL</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Participated in the operation, drafted the work and

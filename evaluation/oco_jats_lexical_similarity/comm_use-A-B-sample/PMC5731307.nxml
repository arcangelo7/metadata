atrial wall by blood. It is a rare complication during cardiac surgery and it occurs
in up to 0.84 percent of mitral valve replacements. This surgical complication can
result in haemodynamic collapse and can also be fatal<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Other rarer surgical complication causes include mitral valve repair, aortic valve
surgery, myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, cardiac mass
excision, left ventricular aneurysm repair, coronary artery bypass graft, blunt
cardiac trauma, pulmonary vein cannulation, infective endocarditis and spontaneous
occurrence<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Left atrial dissection can present a variety of symptoms such as chest pain, dyspnea,
palpitations, fatigue, syncope, and cardiac arrest. One of the most common
presentations is a rapid hemodynamic change with weaning of cardiopulmonary bypass.
Obstruction of pulmonary veins and mitral inflow causes congestive heart failure and
low-output syndrome<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>We are going to report a rare case of left atrial dissection related to a left
ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation, that caused obstruction of the assist
device and right ventricular dysfunction, and discuss its management.</p></sec><sec><title>CASE REPORT</title><p>A 38-year-old male patient was presented with end-stage heart failure, based on the
New York Heart Association class IV, and was hemodynamically supported by a
peripheral femoral venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)
Cardiohelp device (Maquet Holding, Germany). The patient's medical history indicated
that he has suffered from chronic heart failure, due to dilated cardiomyopathy, and
that during the last two months, he has been hospitalized several times due to acute
heart decompensation. ECMO was implanted as a bridge-tobridge strategy and he was
transferred to our institution for further treatment. Accordingly, the patient
underwent implantation of a LVAD, HeartMate 3 (Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, CA, USA).
The operation was performed through median sternotomy with ECMO support. The inflow
cannula of the HeartMate 3 LVAD was implanted in the left ventricular apex, and the
outflow cannula in the ascending aorta. After completion of the operation, and
during weaning of the ECMO device based on signs of right ventricular dysfunction, a
right ventricular assist device (RVAD), Cardiohelp (Maquet Holding, Germany), was
implanted with cannulation of the femoral vein and the pulmonary artery.</p><p>During the immediate postoperative period, there were signs of LVAD low-flow due to
low left ventricular filling and an increasing need for RVAD support. Additionally,
serial transthoracic echocardiograms showed a hyperechogenic lesion in the left
atrium that resulted in mitral valve inflow obstruction.</p><p>Surgical revision was decided and intraoperative echocardiography confirmed the
presence of left atrial lesion with the endocardial layer of the left atrium
separated from the left atrial wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figures
1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">C</xref>). With the use of cardiopulmonary bypass, a left atriotomy was
performed, which identified that the posterior atrial wall has suffered a large
hematoma (atrial wall dissection) that obstructed the mitral valve inflow. The space
was evacuated and the dissected layers were reapproximated using full thickness 4/0
polypropylene sutures to the posterior muscular wall through the mitral annulus and
the left atrial appendage. Early postoperative transesophageal echocardiography
showed that the left atrial lesion was significantly smaller, without any
obstruction of the mitral valve inflow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure
1D</xref>). Also, during the procedure, the inflow cannula of the RVAD was
transferred from the femoral vein to the right atrium.</p><p>

echocardiography; (C) Intraoperative Doppler echocardiography; (D) Early
postoperative echocardiogram after the repair.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-32-06-0542-g01"/></fig>
</p><p>After the left atrial wall dissection repair, the LVAD flow returned to normal and a
weaning process for the RVAD was initiated. In the subsequent postoperative period,
there was a recovery of the right ventricular function, and eventually the RVAD was
explanted.</p><p>Moreover, the postoperative recovery was complicated, with few surgical revisions due
to pericardial tamponade. On postoperative day 43, the patient was discharged in
stable clinical condition. Transthoracic echocardiography on discharge showed
regression of the atrial hematoma after the repair with residual thickening of the
left atrial wall, without any obstruction of the mitral inflow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). An informed consent and an institutional review board
permission were obtained to present this case.</p><p>

</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Left atrial wall dissection is a rare complication and the true incidence, etiology
and management remain poorly defined. It is mostly associated with atrioventricular
junction injuries, however, as presented in this report, there are other less common
cases remote from the atrioventricular junction (dome of left atrium or junction of
the pulmonary veins entering the left atrium)<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. We believe that the left atrial dissection in the
presented case occurred during elevation and placement of the laparotomy pads under
the heart while inserting the inflow cannula of the HeartMate 3 device into the left
ventricular apex. Manipulation of the heart and mechanical pressure applied on the
left atrium by the laparotomy pads may have resulted in left atrial wall
dissection.</p><p>In 1985, Maeda et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> firstly
reported a surgical repair of left atrial dissection through left thoracotomy. Since
then, different surgical approaches have been described<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. Surgical techniques reported include primary
repair, repair with bovine/synthetic patch and in association with mitral valve
replacement, prosthesis explantation and reimplantation for which careful sizing of
the valve is crucial<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Repair of the left atrial wall dissection should focus on evacuation of the hematoma
and blood from the false atrial cavity, obliteration of the dissected cavity, and
repair of the dissection entry point as required. In this case, we did not identify
the dissection entry point, and, as such, a full-thickness continuous suture was
used to obliterate the cavity. Furthermore, BioGlue (Cryolife, INC, Kennesaw, GA,
USA) can be used to bring the dissected layer together<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>A spectrum of clinical presentations exists as well as required treatments that
depend on how extensive the atrioventricular disruption is and on what is the
direction of the dissecting blood. Prompt diagnosis and repair with obliteration of
the false cavity may prevent obstruction of the mitral valve inflow, pulmonary
artery hypertension and right heart failure. Based on the review of the available
literature, all of intraoperative left atrial wall dissections should be repaired.
Acute, left atrial wall dissections resulting in mitral valve inflow obstruction
require repair; and delayed left atrial wall dissection in a stable patient can be
managed conservatively<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In conclusion, this study report describes a rare case of a left atrial wall
dissection in association with an LVAD implantation, which was successfully managed
with surgical repair.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="50%" span="1"/><col width="50%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MH</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work

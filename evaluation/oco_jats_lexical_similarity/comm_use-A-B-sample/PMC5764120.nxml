discovery in the 1980s, extensive research has been conducted to improve their properties,
and emerging evidence supports their increased application in bone tissue engineering.
Much effort has been made to enhance the biological performance of CPCs, including their
biocompatibility, osteoconductivity, osteoinductivity, biodegradability, bioactivity, and
interactions with cells. This review article focuses on the major recent developments in
CPCs, including 3D printing, injectability, stem cell delivery, growth factor and drug
delivery, and pre-vascularization of CPC scaffolds via co-culture and tri-culture
techniques to enhance angiogenesis and osteogenesis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>There has been a continuous and fast-paced emergence of new synthetic biomaterials
developed for bone repair and regeneration over the past several decades. These
biomaterials include metals, polymers, ceramics, bioactive glasses, calcium sulfates,
calcium carbonates and calcium phosphates (CaPs). Among them, calcium phosphate cements
(CPCs) are promising for clinical applications due to their advantageous properties
including bioactivity, osteoconductivity, injectability and moldability. The discovery of
the first CPC occurred inadvertently via the observation of calcium phosphate solubility
behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1 bib2 bib3">1&#x02013;3</xref></sup> Brown and Chow
found that the solubilities of tetracalcium phosphate [TTCP:
Ca<sub>4</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>O], dicalcium phosphate (DCPA:
CaHPO<sub>4</sub>) and dicalcium phosphate dehydrate (DCPD: CaHPO<sub>4</sub>
2H<sub>2</sub>O) were much greater than that of hydroxyapatite (HA) under neutral pH
conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> A slurry containing appropriate
amounts of TTCP and DCPD (or DCPA) led to HA precipitation as an end product and was
capable of self-setting to form a hard mass.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> In the decade following this first discovery, CPCs were
approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and were introduced into clinical
practice for the treatment of craniofacial defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> and bone fractures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> Since
then, other CPC formulations have been developed, and a large amount of research has been
conducted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7 bib8 bib9 bib10 bib11 bib12 bib13 bib14 bib15 bib16 bib17 bib18">7&#x02013;18</xref></sup> Currently, CPCs are defined as a combination of one or
more calcium phosphate powders which, upon mixing with a liquid phase, form a paste able
to self-set and harden <italic>in situ</italic> in the bone defect site to form a
scaffold.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup></p><p>One of the most important characteristics of CPCs is their ability to form <italic>in
situ</italic> through a body-temperature dissolution-precipitation reaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> This feature gives rise to other beneficial properties
such as molding capability upon mixing,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup>
injectability that enables minimally invasive application,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> and the ability to serve as a carrier for drug and biological
molecule delivery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> Early research on CPCs
primarily focused on improved setting, handling and mechanical properties of CPCs through
the tailoring of many processing parameters such as cement composition, additives,
porogens, and particle size.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23 bib24 bib25 bib26 bib27 bib28">23&#x02013;28</xref></sup> In recent years, in addition to the development of new
processing technologies in CPC manufacturing, the paradigm has shifted toward biological
responses by emphasizing the enhancement of biological interactions of CPCs with cells and
tissues as well as their applications in bone tissue engineering.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29 bib30 bib31 bib32 bib33">29&#x02013;33</xref></sup> Biological responses
of scaffolds are a key factor in the translational application of biomaterials and their
commercialization for clinic applications. Several meritorious reviews on CPCs have
described their mechanical properties,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34 bib35 bib36">34&#x02013;36</xref></sup> processing approaches,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> drug delivery,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> and functional enhancement by
polymeric additives,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup> which will not be
repeated here. The present article reviews the major new developments in CPC processing
technologies in recent years and focuses on novel biological interactions of CPCs,
particularly in the context of stem cell responses and delivery as well as <italic>in
vivo</italic> bone regeneration. The various CPC categories described in this article and
their major biological properties are summarized in the diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Pre-fabricated CPC scaffolds and 3D printing</title><p>Although injectability is one of the advantages of CPCs, pre-fabricated CPC scaffolds are
often prepared for two reasons: (1) To ensure a complete setting reaction because only
fully set CPCs demonstrate excellent tissue responses. When CPCs fail to set, they cause
inflammatory reactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> Therefore,
manufacturing pre-fabricated CPCs ensures complete setting prior to <italic>in vivo</italic>
application. (2) To facilitate the creation of interconnected macroporous structures into
CPCs. Self-setting CPC scaffolds without any modification are microporous but not
macroporous and have limited pore interconnections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></sup> To promote tissue in-growth and accelerate the CPC degradation rate
and subsequent replacement by bone, macropores were incorporated into CPCs via two
methods: particle leaching (the addition of water-soluble particles, such as sodium
bicarbonate, mannitol, salt or glucose, that dissolve or degrade after setting) and
gas-foaming (the formation of air bubbles during the setting period).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup>
<italic>In situ</italic> setting with particle leaching has several disadvantages. First, because
the porogens inside the cement have limited exposure to body fluids, the degradation or
solubility of the particles may be compromised, which leads to limited
porosity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref></sup> Second, the <italic>in vivo</italic>
dissolution of some particles may result in hyperosmosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref></sup> Third, some porogens may increase the paste viscosity and impede
the injectability of CPC. The major drawback of <italic>in situ</italic> application of the
gas-foaming method is the risk of air emboli or emphysema. Therefore, pre-fabricated CPC
scaffolds have been developed to allow more delicate control of the setting process and
macroporous architecture of the scaffolds before <italic>in vivo</italic> implantation.</p><p>Recently, three-dimensional (3D) printing has rapidly developed to allow the fabrication
of pre-set CPC scaffolds. 3D printing is an additive manufacturing process in which
geometrical data are used to produce 3D structures by depositing materials layer by
layer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref></sup> 3D-printed CPC scaffolds are
favored over customization to meet the specific needs of each patient/defect. The benefits
for clinical applications include easy adaptation and fixation, reduced surgical time,
favorable esthetic results and minimal waste products. There are several different
techniques for 3D printing, including direct 3D printing (direct ink writing), fused
deposition modeling (FDM), stereolithography (SLA), and selective laser sintering (SLS).
For a detailed description of each technique, readers are encouraged to read previous
review papers on this topic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref></sup> For CPC scaffolds, binder jetting is the most commonly employed 3D
printing technique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref></sup> Briefly, one or several
print heads spray a binder solution (for example, an aqueous solution) precisely onto a
bed layer of CPC powder. The binder locally joins adjacent powder particles together and
hardens the wetted areas through the dissolution-precipitation reaction. The process
repeats by spreading another layer of powder and ejecting binders according to a pass
designed by the computer. This continues until the complete 3D structure is
formed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref></sup> The printability of the material
is related to many parameters such as particle size and size distribution, morphology and
surface area of the powder, roughness and flowability of the powders, the
solubility/wettability/reactivity of the powder with the binder, and binder drop
size.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref></sup> A study investigating
beta-tricalcium phosphate powder suggested that 3D printing was not feasible with
particles either too small (with a mean particle size of 7 &#x003bc;m) or too large (with a
mean particle size of 51 &#x003bc;m), while mean particle sizes in the range of 20&#x02013;35
&#x003bc;m resulted in good printing accuracy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref></sup>
Small particles tend to agglomerate under the influence of van der Waals forces. Very fine
or porous particles exhibit low flowability and high surface roughness. Therefore, these
factors greatly affect the smoothness and homogeneity of the powder bed, resulting in
smearing and poor resolution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref></sup> However,
although large particles have better flowability, they tend to yield layer displacements
due to low powder bed stability and low accuracy because the resolution is at least twice
the particle size.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref></sup> Flowability was shown to be
significantly reduced by decreasing the HA granule size.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref></sup> To work with small particle sizes to achieve a high resolution,
strategies such as plasma coating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref></sup> and moisture
application<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref></sup> were attempted to stabilize
the top layer surface and allow particle rearrangement and wetting while avoiding particle
ejection out of the powder bed. Furthermore, by adding reactive minerals such as calcium
sulfates into calcium phosphate, significant improvements to 3D printing parameters are
achieved.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref></sup> The dimensional accuracy of
printed CPC scaffolds (powder: alfa-TCP; liquid: Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>) is
~200&#x000b7;&#x003bc;m, which indicates a good degree of fitting to craniofacial defects in
anatomical models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref></sup> A critical step for
powder-based 3D printing is the removal of the loose powder inside the pores of the
printed scaffold after printing, a process known as depowdering. Depowdering is especially
challenging when the pores and pore interconnections are small and found in the innermost
parts of the scaffolds with large dimensions. One possible solution may be the use of
depowdering-friendly designs with large windows and free-to-move fillers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref></sup> In addition, layer thickness and printing orientations
(parallel to the <italic>X</italic>, <italic>Y</italic> and <italic>Z</italic> directions) are important for
depowdering.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref></sup> Shear forces at the powder
bed increase with reduced layer thickness, which leads to the deterioration of the final
printed samples upon depowdering. Depowdering is easier in scaffolds printed in the
<italic>X</italic> and <italic>Y</italic> directions than that in scaffolds printed in the <italic>Z</italic>
direction because of the distortion in samples printed in the <italic>Z</italic>
direction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref></sup> However, the relationship
between 3D printing parameters and CPC scaffold quality and performance has yet to be
established and warrants further study.</p><p>3D plotting (direct ink writing, direct write assembly, material extrusion) is another
common technique for CPC 3D printing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref></sup> This is
an extrusion-based printing technology in which a paste or viscous materials, instead of
powders, are used as the starting form and deposited as strands via a nozzle in a
layer-by-layer fashion based on predesigned structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">60</xref></sup> For 3D plotting, the printability is dependent on even dispersion,
viscosity, fluidity, extrusion performance, setting time of the paste, and the shape
stability of the printed strands to withstand the weight of the structure during assembly.
The setting time for CPCs plays an important role in controlling the printable time period
of the paste. One study reported the printable time of a CPC (powder: TECP:DCPA=1:1 molar
ratio, liquid/binder: polyvinyl alcohol) as only 10&#x000b7;min, which makes printing
difficult.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">61</xref></sup> With the addition of a
mesoporous calcium silicate, the printable time was increased to approximately
120&#x000b7;min.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">61</xref></sup> Other optimizations of the
direct printing ink formulation have included the addition of gelatin to introduce an
induction time for the onset of the CPC setting reaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">62</xref></sup> Specifically, this formula includes Targon 1128 as the dispersant,
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) as the thickening agent, polyethylenimine (PEI) as
the jellifying agent,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">63</xref></sup> and a ready-to-use
oil-based CPC paste that sets only upon contact with water and thus has no time limit for
printing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref></sup></p><p>A critical issue for printing resolution is nozzle diameter and the stability of the
extruded strands.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref></sup> 3D plotting has two
advantages: (1) it enables easy printing of a combination of different
materials,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">64</xref></sup> and (2) due to the mild
conditions, it allows simultaneous cell or growth factor plotting, known as
bioprinting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">65</xref></sup> Using a two-channel plotting method, a scaffold with the combination
of an oil-based CPC and an alginate-gellan hydrogel was fabricated and laden with growth
factor VEGF, involving a highly sophisticated strand arrangement, pore structure and
geometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">64</xref></sup> In another study, a bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2)-loaded
mesoporous silica/CPC porous scaffold was 3D-plotted and tested in <italic>in vitro</italic> cell
culture and in a rabbit femur defect model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">66</xref></sup>
The scaffold promoted the osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow stromal cells
(hBMSCs) and enhanced vascularization and osteogenesis compared to the CPC
control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">66</xref></sup> In terms of cell-containing
bioprinting, hydrogels such as alginate,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">67</xref></sup>
collagen,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">68</xref></sup> synthetic polymers such as PLGA,
and PEG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">69</xref></sup> are primarily used as bioinks due to
their resemblance to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and good printability. In some cases,
calcium phosphates are added to enhance cell attachment and osteogenic differentiation,
thus favoring the use of bioink for bone tissue engineering applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">67</xref></sup></p><p>In general, due to the incremental addition of materials, 3D printing allows for not only
the easy control of scaffold shape and geometry but also the control of fine features such
as interconnected porosity, pore size and distribution, and complex spatial heterogeneity,
which are not achievable with traditional strategies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref></sup> The possibility of manufacturing customized implants with almost
no design limitations makes 3D printing highly valuable in reconstructive surgery.
However, more extensive research is needed to optimize the key parameters for successful
3D printing of CPC scaffolds.</p></sec><sec><title>Injectable CPC scaffolds</title><p>Traditional bone grafting requires an open surgical approach to graft application sites
and may be associated with complications such as a large surgical scar, increased pain and
a longer post-operative recovery. To overcome these drawbacks, injectable bone graft
substitutes are used for minimally invasive surgery. Two main obstacles that inhibit CPC
injectability are liquid-solid phase separation during injection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">70</xref></sup> and paste disintegration upon contact with blood or body
fluids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">71</xref></sup> Phase separation leads to not only
the presence of non-extrudable paste left in the syringe but also extravasation at the
injection site and a decrease in the viscosity and mechanical strength of CPCs. The
disintegration of CPCs in the body causes inflammatory responses and even severe
consequences such as cement embolism and cardiovascular deterioration by simulating blood
coagulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">72</xref></sup> Therefore, efforts have been
made to improve CPC injectability. These strategies include the following: (1) increasing
the viscosity of the liquid phase by adding viscous binders such as chitosan,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> gelatin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">73</xref></sup>
hyaluronic acid,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">74</xref></sup> methylcellulose,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">75</xref></sup> and others; (2) optimizing the CPC powder in terms of
the particle size, particle size distribution, particle shape, and particle-particle
interactions;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">76</xref></sup> (3) regulating the setting
reaction;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">77</xref></sup> and (4) modifying the extrusion
parameters such as CPC mixing and the sizes of the syringes and/or needles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">78</xref></sup> All of these factors were discussed in detail in a
recent review on CPC injectability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">70</xref></sup></p><p>Recently, many studies have applied various injectable CPC formulations into animal
models for bone regeneration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">80</xref></sup> Injectable CPCs containing 50% (volume ratio) microspheres
(poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), gelatin (GEL) or poly(trimethylene carbonate)
(PTMC)) were implanted into rabbit femoral bone defects. CPC/GEL had a significantly lower
score than all other groups at the cement-bone interface. Both CPC and CPC/PLGA showed a
better response than CPC/PTMC at 4 weeks, but there were no significant differences among
these three groups at 8 and 12 weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">79</xref></sup> A recent
study applied a commercially injectable CPC (Calcibon) with platelet lysates in bilateral
calvarial defects in rats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">81</xref></sup> The delivery of the
platelet lysate enhanced bone healing with an injectable CPC at early healing times. In
large animal models, injectable CPCs have also shown promise for bone regeneration. For
example, injectable CPC/PLGA composites demonstrated biocompatibility and direct bone
contact for sinus floor augmentation procedures in a sheep model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">82</xref></sup> Another study evaluated the efficiency of local bisphosphonate
delivery via injectable CPC in vertebral bodies of the lumbar spine of an osteoporotic
sheep model where the consequences of osteoporotic fractures were highly deleterious in
patients. The bisphosphonate-combined cement in vertebral body bone defects had a
beneficial impact on both bone content and the micro-architectural properties of the
trabecular bone surrounding the implant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">83</xref></sup> These
animal studies demonstrated the promise of using injectable CPCs for bone repair and
regeneration.</p><p>Indeed, CPCs have gained clinical acceptance as valuable bone substitution biomaterials
for over 20 years, and several CPCs are commercially available. Injectable CPCs were used
to repair human periodontal intrabony defects and showed favorable radiographic
results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">84</xref></sup> CPCs were also used in young
patients for balloon kyphoplasty instead of polymethylmethacrylate cement. In most cases,
good integration of CPCs in the vertebra was observed with no radiological signs of
osteolysis or osteonecrosis. Only a few patients showed demineralization in follow-up CT
scans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">85</xref></sup> Several papers reviewing the
properties of injectable CPCs are available for readers who want additional
detail.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86 bib87 bib88">86&#x02013;88</xref></sup> The present
review focuses on new developments in CPCs with an emphasis on their biological

requirement for tissue-engineered products to support cellular activities and optimize
tissue regeneration without eliciting a cytotoxic effect in those cells or causing
undesirable local or systemic responses in the host. The end products of the
dissolution-precipitation reactions for CPCs include brushite (DCPD) and apatite (HA or
calcium deficient HA (CDHA)), which are known to be biocompatible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">90</xref></sup> Pre-set CPCs exhibit favorable short-term and
long-term biocompatibility, as evidenced by many studies evaluating tissue responses in

reaction to avoid cytotoxicity, as unset or disintegrated CPCs cause severe inflammatory
responses, blood clotting, and cement embolism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">97</xref></sup> Incorporating polymers into
CPCs is a strategy used to improve CPC properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup> In a recent study, an injectable macroporous CPC was prepared by
the syringe-foaming method using a hydrophilic viscous polymeric solution known as
silanized-hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (Si-HPMC).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">98</xref></sup> Si-HPMC not only acts as a foaming agent to create macroporous
structures inside CPCs but also endows the CPC paste with an appealing rheological
behavior at the early stage of setting due to its self-crosslinking properties, thus
improving its injectability and cohesion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">98</xref></sup>
Indeed, when this CPC was injected into defective rabbit femurs, no adverse foreign body
reaction was observed at 1 week and 6 weeks post-implantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">98</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Bioactivity</title><p>Bioactivity refers to the ability of bone scaffolds to bind directly to the surrounding
bone without the formation of fibrous tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">99</xref></sup> Bioactivity is often evaluated by examining the ability to form
apatite on the biomaterial in a simulated body fluid (SBF) with ion concentrations close
to those in human blood plasma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">100</xref></sup> A
bioactive material is defined as one that accelerates apatite crystallization in a
solution supersaturated with respect to hydroxyapatite.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">100</xref></sup> However, the validity of using an <italic>in vitro</italic> SBF test to
predict the <italic>in vivo</italic> bioactivity of a material has been questioned.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">101</xref></sup> For example, Bohner and Lemaitre showed that a
bioactivity test with SBF may not only give false-positive results but also
false-negative results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">101</xref></sup> The authors
concluded that &#x0201c;<italic>in vitro</italic> bioactivity tests in SBF solutions cannot be

some improvements to the protocol, these tests may be used for initial screening.
However, the most reliable evaluation method remains <italic>in vivo</italic> implantation in a
bone defect.</p><p>Bioactivity is one of the most important properties of CPCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> To further enhance CPC bioactivity, bioactive glass, which is
known for its bioactivity, was incorporated into CPCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">102</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">103</xref></sup> The bioactive glass acted
as a source of calcium and phosphate ions in the cement setting reaction. With this
addition, increasing apatite formation was detected on the surface of the CaP compound
after soaking in SBF for 7 days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">103</xref></sup>
<italic>In vivo</italic> examination of samples implanted into rabbit femoral bones indeed
showed a better healing process and more bone growth with the addition of bioactive

of new bone into a surface or a volume in which the biomaterial serves as a scaffold to
guide new bone formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">104</xref></sup> CPCs are
osteoconductive because they permit the attachment, proliferation, migration and
phenotypic expression of bone cells, leading to the formation of new bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">105</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">106</xref></sup> Osteoconduction
is related to the architectural geometry of the scaffold.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">106</xref></sup> Intimate adaptation, fixation and stability of the implant to
the defect site are of critical importance to facilitate the in-growth of bone tissue.
In addition, the scaffold should have high porosity and interconnectivity with optimal
pore sizes to ensure cell penetration, nutrient exchange and waste elimination. For bone
tissue engineering, an ideal scaffold should have 60%&#x02013;80% interconnected porosity
with pore sizes ranging from 150 to 500 &#x003bc;m.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">107</xref></sup></p><p>Osteoconduction also depends on the chemical composition of the scaffold. The
incorporation of several types of ions benefit CPC osteoconductivity. For instance, a
silicon CPC (Si-CPC) was developed,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">108</xref></sup> and
the cytocompatibility of the Si-doped cement was tested with a human osteoblast-like
cell line (MG-63), which showed enhanced cell proliferation (up to threefold) over that
without Si. When implanted in a rabbit parietal bone defect model, significantly greater
amounts of new bone were detected in the 10% Si-CPC group compared to that in the CPC
control group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">108</xref></sup> In another study, strontium
was incorporated into CPC (Sr-CPC) to enhance its osteoconductivity and accelerate its
degradation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">109</xref></sup>
<italic>In vitro</italic> studies showed higher osteoblastic cell proliferation rates in Sr-CPC
groups. <italic>In vivo</italic> studies demonstrated more rapid degradation and advanced
osteoconductivity in the 10% Sr-CPC group compared to those in the CPC control at 2, 4,
8, 16, and 32 weeks after the operation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">109</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Osteoinductivity</title><p>Osteoinduction is defined as the recruitment and stimulation of progenitor cells to
differentiate toward the osteoblastic lineage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">104</xref></sup> CPCs are generally osteoconductive but not
osteoinductive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> However, several CPCs
reportedly have the ability to form bone in nonosseous sites <italic>in vivo</italic> without
the addition of osteogenic factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">110</xref></sup> Since
this osteoinductive property is observed for some CPCs but not others, these materials
are described as having &#x0201c;intrinsic&#x0201d; osteoinductivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">111</xref></sup> This inductive phenomenon is likely attributable to
the combined effects of topography, composition, and micro and macroporosity of the CPC
scaffolds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">111</xref></sup> It is likely that the
intricate architecture of the scaffold permits the entrapment and concentration of
circulating growth factors, such as BMPs and osteoprogenitor cells, <italic>in vivo</italic>
thus conferring osteoinduction capability upon the CPCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">111</xref></sup> In addition, CPCs serve as calcium and phosphate ion sources
<italic>in vivo</italic>. Ca<sup>2+</sup>, PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> and
HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> ions are released into the surrounding tissues, regulate
osteoblast functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">112</xref></sup> and induce localized
ion supersaturation, which causes the reprecipitation of carbonated apatite on the
scaffold.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">113</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">114</xref></sup> A previous study proposed a new strategy to regulate bone
marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) adhesion and osteogenic differentiation by adding
magnesium into the CPC, thus improving its osteoinductivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">115</xref></sup> A CPC containing 5 wt% and 10 wt% magnesium not only enhanced
BMSC adhesion but also upregulated osteogenic gene and protein expression <italic>in
vitro</italic>. An <italic>in vivo</italic> study demonstrated that CPC with 5 wt% magnesium
achieved the greatest bone volume at 2 and 8 weeks, confirming its beneficial
osteogenesis effects via the addition of magnesium.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">115</xref></sup> To gain or enhance CPC osteoinductivity, novel strategies such
as the addition of osteoprogenitor cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">116</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">117</xref></sup> growth
factors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">118</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">119</xref></sup> bioactive proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">120</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">121</xref></sup> or peptides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">122</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">123</xref></sup> into CPCs have
exhibited favorable effects. Therefore, novel CPC compositions with intrinsic and
engineered osteoinductivity are highly promising to enhance bone regeneration.</p></sec><sec><title>Biodegradability</title><p>Ideally, a CPC scaffold should degrade at the same rate that new bone forms. CPCs
biodegrade primarily via two mechanisms: a passive resorption process via chemical
dissolution and an active resorption through a cell-mediated process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">124</xref></sup> The degradation of CPCs is tailored by controlling
several factors: (1) physical factors such as the physical form of the CPC (particulate
or bulk), porosity, surface area, and crystallinity (crystal size, crystal perfection,
and grain size), and so on; (2) chemical factors such as the composition and ionic
substitutions; and (3) biological factors such as the activation of macrophages or
osteoclasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">125</xref></sup> Enhancing CPC degradation
is achieved by adding rapidly degradable porogens such as PLGA to generate macropores
upon PLGA degradation. PLGA degrades hydrolytically, leading to the production of lactic
and glycolic acid monomers. The acidic nature of the resulting byproducts is an
additional advantage of PLGAs in combination with poorly degradable CPCs because CPCs
degrade by acid dissolution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">126</xref></sup> After being
injected into a rabbit femoral bone defect model, CPC-PLGA exhibited favorable bone
responses with &#x0003e;55% degradation and &#x0003e;13% bone formation at 6 weeks and &#x0003e;90%
degradation and &#x0003e;40% bone formation at 26 weeks postoperation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">127</xref></sup> Based on this same mechanism, glucono delta-lactone
(GDL), which has a faster degradation rate than PLGA, was incorporated into CPCs as
acid-producing microparticles to accelerate CPC degradation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">128</xref></sup> Indeed, histomorphometrical evaluation revealed that CPCs
containing 10% of GDL degraded more rapidly and were replaced by more bone tissue
(32.8%) than CPC-PLGA at 2 weeks after implantation in a rabbit femoral bone
defect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">128</xref></sup></p></sec></sec><sec><title>CPC scaffold constructs for bone tissue engineering</title><sec><title>Cell delivery</title><p>Recent advancements in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine have indicated that
cell-based therapeutics achieve robust regeneration with greater efficacy and better
predictability than methods that do not involve cell seeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">129</xref></sup> These novel approaches employ scaffold constructs in
combination with living cells to generate cell-driven, functional tissue rather than
filling a defect with a nonliving scaffold. A tissue-engineered construct acts both as a
scaffold to bridge the defect and as a cell delivery vehicle. The biomaterial-cell
interactions of CPCs with various types of stem cells, such as BMSCs, umbilical cord
mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs), embryonic stem cells (ESCs), induced pluripotent stem
cells (iPSCs), were previously reviewed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">130</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">131</xref></sup> The present article
specifically explores recent advances in strategies for cell delivery, specifically
highlighting the design of CPC-based scaffolds.</p><p>Direct cell seeding onto the porous surfaces of preformed CPC scaffolds is a common
approach due to its simplicity. However, this type of static cell seeding has
limitations, including low seeding efficiency and minimal cell penetration into the
scaffold, leading to non-uniform cell distribution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">132</xref></sup> It is not feasible to directly mix cells into the CPC paste
because the mixing forces, ionic exchanges and pH fluctuation during CPC setting are
detrimental to cell viability. To address this problem, cell encapsulation has been
proposed to protect cells during CPC mixing and injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure
3</xref>). In a recent study, human iPSC-derived MSCs (hiPSC-MSCs) were either
pre-osteoinduced for 2 weeks (OS-hiPSC-MSCs) or transduced with BMP2 (BMP2-hiPSC-MSCs)
to enhance their osteogenic capacity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">133</xref></sup> The
cells were then encapsulated in rapidly degradable alginate microbeads. The microbeads
were mixed with CPC paste at a ratio of 1:1 and filled into cranial defects in nude
rats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">133</xref></sup> The results showed that the
cells maintained good viability inside the microbeads after injection. Once the CPC set
to form a scaffold, the cells were released as early as 3 days and demonstrated the
up-regulation of osteogenic markers and bone mineral deposition. Cell-encapsulated
groups produced greater amounts of new bone area <italic>in vivo</italic>, with 22.5%&#x000b1;7.6%,
38.9%&#x000b1;18.4%, and 44.7%&#x000b1;22.8% for the CPC-hiPSC-MSC, CPC-OS-hiPSC-MSC, and
CPC-BMP2-hiPSC-MSC groups, respectively, compared to that for the non-cell CPC control
group (15.6%&#x000b1;11.2%) at 12 weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">133</xref></sup>
Furthermore, the incorporation of cells accelerated the resorption of the CPC scaffold.
The amount of residual CPC in the CPC-BMP2-hiPSC-MSC group was sevenfold less than that
in the CPC control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">133</xref></sup></p><p>Recently, rapidly degradable hydrogel fibers were developed for cell encapsulation and
delivery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">134</xref></sup> Encapsulation of cells
inside microfibers possesses several advantages over microbeads. (1) Microfibers are
easily fabricated by using a simple needle extrusion/external gelation method. To
generate microbeads, air injection and electronic injection are needed to break up
alginate droplets to form microbeads in sizes of several hundred microns.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">135</xref></sup> The air flow or electrostatic force during
microbead formation may impose harsh shearing forces on the cells. Furthermore, the air
flow forms &#x0201c;tails&#x0201d; on the microbeads, which may cause an immune response
<italic>in vivo</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">135</xref></sup> (2) Microfibers with
diameters of several hundred microns and millimeter-scale lengths are relatively easy to
handle. (3) Microfibers provide more space for cellular self-assembly, through which
living cells organize into functional units, allowing cells to grow, migrate and
differentiate in the extracellular matrix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">136</xref></sup>
(4) Long microfibers form long macroporous channels with interconnectivity upon alginate
degradation inside CPCs, while microbeads only form spherical pores with limited
interconnectivity. These long channels improve osteoconductivity and nutrient and waste
exchange of the scaffold. (5) Long microfibers potentially facilitate the formation of
blood vessels in CPCs for bone engineering via co-seeding of endothelial cells and
osteoblasts.</p><p>Recent studies have encapsulated six types of stem cells, specifically hBMSCs, human
dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs), hUCMSCs, hESC-MSCs, and hiPSC-MSCs derived from bone
marrow (BM-hiPSC-MSCs) and foreskin (FS-hiPSC-MSCs), in hydrogel microfibers and then
delivered them inside an injectable CPC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">126</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">127</xref></sup> The CPC paste encapsulating
the stem cells was fully injectable under a small injection force, and the injection
exerted no harmful effects on cell viability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">137</xref></sup> The porosity of the microfiber-CPC construct was
62%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">138</xref></sup> All six types of cells
proliferated well and differentiated down the osteogenic lineage. hUCMSCs, hESC-MSCs,
hDPSCs, BM-hiPSC-MSCs and hBMSCs exhibited high ALP, RUNX2, COL1A1, and OC gene
expression. Cell-synthesized bone minerals increased with time, with no significant
differences among hUCMSCs, hESC-MSCs, hDPSCs, BM-hiPSC-MSCs and hBMSCs, indicating good
bone regeneration potential similar to gold-standard hBMSCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">137</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">138</xref></sup> However, FS-hiPSC-MSCs were
inferior in terms of osteogenic differentiation compared to other cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">138</xref></sup> In
another <italic>in vivo</italic> study, an hBMSC-encapsulated microfiber-CPC paste was applied
to repair rat cranial defects,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">138</xref></sup> and the
hBMSC-encapsulated microfiber-CPC tissue engineering construct exhibited a robust
capacity for bone regeneration. At 12 weeks, an osseous bridge in the rat mandibular
defect was observed in the CPC-microfiber-hBMSCs group with a new bone area fraction of
42.1%&#x000b1;7.8%, which was threefold greater than that of the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">139</xref></sup>
Therefore, these results demonstrate that injectable hydrogel microfiber-CPC paste is a

incorporation of drugs and biologically active molecules with low risk of thermal
denaturalization or loss of activity during preparation or implantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> For drug incorporation into CPCs, the drug is simply
mixed with either the liquid or solid components of the cement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">140</xref></sup> Alternatively, it is added by adsorption onto the

of therapeutic substances. These include the microstructure, porosity and surface area
of the CPCs, the way in which the drug is incorporated into the CPCs, and the

Failure of the bone healing process, including delayed healing or non-unions, is often
attributable to a lack of adequate vascularization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">154</xref></sup> Furthermore, vascularization is critical for the viability of
seeded cells in the scaffold. If the distance between cells and the nearest capillary
network is greater than 100&#x02013;200&#x000b7;&#x003bc;m, which exceeds the diffusion or
perfusion limits of nutrients and oxygen, the viability of the seeded cells is
compromised.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">89</xref></sup></p><p>Improvement in CPC vascularization is stimulated by modifications to the material
itself. Physical features such as porosity and pore sizes are known to impact
vascularization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib155">155</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib156">156</xref></sup> To this end, a study fabricated a self-setting CPC composite
with gelatin fibers to create interconnected hollow channels in the CPC after
dissolution of the gelatin fibers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib157">157</xref></sup>
<italic>In vivo</italic> subcutaneous implantation showed that the resulting channels in CPC
indeed facilitated vascular infiltration into the construct.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib157">157</xref></sup> In addition, different channel sizes induced different
vascularization behaviors <italic>in vivo</italic>. Channels with a 250-&#x003bc;m diameter
increased the expression of the representative angiogenic factors HIF1&#x003b1;, PLGF and
migration factor CXCR4, which induce the formation of small vessels. Channels with a
larger diameter of 500 &#x003bc;m enhanced VEGF expression, which induces the development
of large vessels. More HIF1&#x003b1;-positive cells were found in the interconnected
intersections of several channels, indicating high levels of sprouting and
vasculogenesis potential under hypoxic conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib157">157</xref></sup> While the majority of research has focused on modifying the
physical features of CPCs to improve vascularization, chemical features, such as the
release of ionic calcium and phosphate, have also been suggested to play a role in
regulating vascularization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib158">158</xref></sup> In a recent
study, CPCs were coated with a graphene oxide-copper nanocomposite with the rationale
that the oxygen-containing functional groups in graphene oxide would provide more
binding sites for serum proteins and thereby enhance initial cell adhesion and other
bioactivities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib159">159</xref></sup> When incubated with rat

bone regeneration in the coated-CPC group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib159">159</xref></sup>
However, the mechanism underlying vascularization and the impact on bone regeneration
efficacy via CPCs require additional experiments, particularly <italic>in vivo</italic>
studies.</p><p>From a biological point of view, angiogenic growth factors, stem cells and
vessel-forming cells are highly promising approaches to promote vascularization. A
recent study investigated the use of autologous BMSCs in combination with autologous
platelet-rich plasma (PRP) delivered via a macroporous CPC to regenerate large bone

group generated twofold more new bone and twofold higher blood vessel density compared
to those of the macroporous CPC control at 12 weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib160">160</xref></sup> In addition, recombinant growth factors and cell signaling
molecules are alternatives to autologous growth factors that provide more flexible and
delicate control over the dose and factors to be incorporated. Several studies have
loaded dual agents, specifically BMPs and VEGF, in a single CPC scaffold, which

were co-cultured with four types of stem cells, specifically hUCMSCs, hBMSCs, hiPSC-MSCs
and hESC-MSCs, on CPCs and then implanted in an 8-mm critical cranial bone defect in
rats for 12 weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib166">166</xref></sup> Microcapillary-like
structures were successfully formed on CPCs <italic>in vitro</italic> in all four co-culture
groups. New bone formation and the blood vessel densities of the co-cultured groups
<italic>in vivo</italic> were much greater than that of the CPC control without cell seeding
or the CPC-BMSCs group without co-culture (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib166">166</xref></sup> These results demonstrated the promise of
co-culture and CPC pre-vascularization to greatly enhance osteogenesis and angiogenesis
<italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>For successful bone regeneration, it is important to establish vascularization in a
timely manner, but the stabilization of such a vascular network is of similar
importance, although it is often neglected. Angiogenesis without vessel maturation
produces abnormal, defective blood vessels that are prone to regression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib167">167</xref></sup> Perivascular cells such as pericytes play important
roles in the stabilization and maturation of blood vessels by guiding the developing
vessels to respond to angiogenic stimuli.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib168">168</xref></sup>
Enlightened by this fact, further improvement of the pre-vascularization strategy with
the addition of pericytes was attempted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib169">169</xref></sup> A
tri-culture system comprising hiPSC-MSCs, HUVECs and pericytes was developed to
pre-vascularize the CPC scaffolds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib169">169</xref></sup> Both
the bi-culture and tri-culture groups exhibited the formation of vessel-like structures
<italic>in vitro</italic>, greatly elevated levels of angiogenic and osteogenic markers, and
bone matrix mineralization. After implantation in a rat model with a cranial bone defect
for 12 weeks, the tri-culture group demonstrated much higher amounts of new bone than
the bi-culture and monoculture groups and the CPC control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure
7</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib169">169</xref></sup> The substantial increase in
bone formation in the tri-culture group was likely related to enhanced vascularization
and the stabilization and maturation of blood vessels.</p><p><italic>In vivo</italic> pre-vascularization is also achieved using a surgical method involving
the implantation of a scaffold into a well-vascularized and easily accessible body
tissue such as a subcutaneous pocket or a muscle pouch. Microvascular structures are
formed as a result of invasion and outgrowth of the surrounding host
microvasculature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib170">170</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib171">171</xref></sup> After the completion of pre-vascularization, the tissue
construct is harvested and grafted into the defect site, where the preformed
microvessels inside the construct inosculate and anastomose with the host blood vessels.
The disadvantages of this approach are obvious: the invasive nature of the surgery,
higher cost, and a relatively longer treatment process. Therefore, new tissue
engineering methods utilizing CPC scaffolds with co-culture and tri-culture represent
exciting alternative strategies that warrant further research for continued improvement
to achieve wide clinical applications.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Due to their injectability, bioactivity and biocompatibility, CPCs are highly promising
for bone tissue engineering applications and are used as scaffolds and carriers to deliver
stem cells, drugs and growth factors. CPCs are either used as pre-set scaffolds or
injectable pastes. 3D printing is a promising technology for fabricating CPC scaffolds
with a high degree of accuracy and is used to develop intricately detailed biomimetic
structures that are not achievable via traditional manufacturing methods. 3D printing has
the potential to facilitate the next generation of smart and functional CPCs. Furthermore,
with recent advances in tissue engineering, a new emphasis on &#x0201c;tissue regeneration
by natural tissues&#x0201d; instead of &#x0201c;tissue replacement by biomaterials&#x0201d;
has been proposed. Thus, CPCs with excellent biological interactions, such as
osteoconductivity, osteoinductivity, biodegradability and bioactivity, are promising to
meet this need. CPC composite constructs and hybrid systems involving the incorporation of
cells, growth factors, bioactive molecules, bioinorganics, polymers, and bioactive glass
are likely to yield favorable bone regenerative outcomes and greatly widen the clinical
applications of CPCs. In addition, the co-culture and tri-culture of various tailored cell
types with CPC scaffolds offer exciting potential for vascularization in bone tissue
regeneration, which is especially important for treating large-sized bone defects. Further
studies are needed to realize these promises and understand the underlying mechanisms to
further the development of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by NIH R01 DE14190 and R21 DE22625 (HX), the National Science

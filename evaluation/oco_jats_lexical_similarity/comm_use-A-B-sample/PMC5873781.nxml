proposal to relieve symptoms and reduce complications in patients whose high rate of

replacement seeking medical help due to heart failure and hemolytic anemia, with an
8.5 mm prosthetic paravalvular regurgitation jet and high surgical mortality
according to EuroSCORE II<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>CASE REPORT</title><p>An 81-year-old male patient was admitted due to New York Heart Association (NYHA)
Functional Class III-IV refractory congestive heart failure despite optimal medical
treatment (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers and angiotensin
II receptors antagonists, under high doses of oral furosemide). The patient had a
history of arterial hypertension, chronic renal failure and pulmonary obstructive
chronic disease. In 2001, he underwent myocardial revascularization surgery, as well
as aortic valve replacement with a biological prosthesis. In 2003, the patient
experienced an ischemic stroke.</p><p>Upon admission, lab tests showed impaired kidney function (urea 88 g/dL and
creatinine 2.1 mg/dL), anemia (Hb 7 g/dL), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (1100 mg/dL),
and grade 3 to predominantly indirect bilirubin (based on patient's history and
complementary tests, hemolytic anemia was assumed).</p><p>A multiplanar transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography was performed, which
showed severely damaged ventricular function and mechanical prosthetic valve in a
bileaflet normal function aortic position with a PVL, leading to severe regurgitant
jet (8.5 mm wide and going into the middle third of the left ventricle). The
regurgitant area was 43 mm<sup>2</sup>, with no images compatible with vegetations
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>

</p><p>The EuroSCORE II<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>
was estimated in order to anticipate surgical mortality and assess surgical risk.
Mortality rate was estimated at 53.41%. Considering this high mortality rate,
percutaneous closure of the PVL was planned.</p><p>In the hemodynamic laboratory, the patient was hemodynamically instable, under
mechanical ventilation and sedoanalgesia by an anesthesiologist. Before the
procedure, 10,000 IU of sodium heparin were administered together with infective
endocarditis prophylaxis, a procedure led by fluoroscopy and transesophageal
echocardiogram.</p><p>The PVL was closed retrogradely with a right femoral artery puncture, using an 8
French introducer. First, a multipurpose catheter angiography was conducted to see
the PVL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">C</xref>). A wire-guided multipurpose catheter was placed towards the
aortic valve plane. A Terumo hydrophilic guidewire was inserted in the catheter in
order to go through the PVL, and then exchange was performed via a high-support
guidewire (Amplatz). Afterwards, the Amplatzer Vascular Plug III (St. Jude Medical,
Plymouth, MN, USA) release system was placed, and once on the dehiscence, the
transesophageal echocardiography showed the end of the leak regurgitation jet. Then,
the occlusion device was released (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>),
after lack of interference with the mechanical prosthesis was ensured.</p><p>The procedure was successful, and immediately after the implantation, a new
transesophageal echocardiography showed no leak. There were no hemodynamic
intercurrences during the procedure. The patient showed clinical improvement of
symptoms at first and then he was hemodynamically stable. After a one-year
follow-up, the patient progressed with no new hospitalizations due to heart failure,
with an improved functional class and 11 mg/dL hemoglobin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>PVL is a serious complication after surgical valve replacement or transcatheter
aortic valve replacement, but the incidence of symptomatic patients is low. For
years, surgical re-intervention has been considered as the treatment of choice for
symptomatic patients with PVL. Transcatheter PVL closure has emerged as a safe,
effective, and less invasive alternative to surgical
reintervention<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. It requires multiple heart imaging tests and a
collaborative team of trained sonographers, anesthetists, hemodynamic technicians
and nurses.</p><p>In this case, the patient had clear clinical signs of refractory heart failure,
hemolytic anemia, and a high EuroSCORE as a result of the previously-cited medical
history, with an aggravated clinical condition leading to increased surgical risk;
therefore, percutaneous closure was performed. In our experience, although the
procedure was technically feasible and successful, there are often potential
complications when implanting a device.</p><p>The pre-occlusion and post-occlusion follow-up method via transesophageal
echocardiography was essential and sufficient for a successful procedure in our
experience, but application and development of current heart imaging techniques -
such as 3D real-time transesophageal echocardiography and, in particular,
angiotomography combined with volume injection and 3D/4D reconstruction - would
allow a better study of dehiscence and also facilitate monitoring the intervention,
especially the tomography, in situations where a clear image of anatomical spaces
and relationships is required, for example, in a transseptal approach of complexly
located leaks.</p><p>Significantly improved functional class and hemoglobin levels were observed over the
patient's clinical course. It is important to note that all devices used nowadays to
close these defects have not been designed for this purpose (offlabel indication),
and therefore, new devices for PVL treatment are being developed. Amplatzer Vascular
Plugs II and III seem to be the best options due to their remarkable serial results.
There have been reports on the use of Amplatzer Vascular Plug III with positive
outcomes<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Percutaneous closure of a PVL using Amplatzer Vascular Plug III device implantation
in a patient with refractory heart failure, hemolytic anaemia and a high EuroSCORE
is a less invasive option than surgical re-intervention, with lower procedural
morbidity and mortality.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="5%" span="1"/><col width="95%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GEPB</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Agreement to be accountable for all

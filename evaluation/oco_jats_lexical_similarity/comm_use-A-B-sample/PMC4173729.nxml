This study is the first systematic follow-up of Finnish primary care patients&#x02019; assessments with regard to personal continuity of care.</p></sec><sec><title>Aim</title><p>To ascertain whether patient-reported longitudinal personal continuity of care is related to patient characteristics and their consultation experiences, and how this had changed over the study period.</p></sec><sec><title>Design and setting</title><p>A 15-year follow-up questionnaire survey that took place at Tampere University Hospital catchment area, Finland.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p>The survey was conducted among patients attending health centres in the Tampere University Hospital catchment area from 1998 until 2013. From a sample of 363 464 patients, a total of 157 549 responded. The responses of patients who had visited a doctor during the survey weeks (<italic>n</italic> = 97 468) were analysed. Continuity of care was assessed by asking the question: &#x02018;When visiting the health centre, do you usually see the same doctor?&#x02019;; patients could answer &#x02018;yes&#x02019; or &#x02018;no&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Approximately half of the responders had met the same doctor when visiting the healthcare centre. Personal continuity of care decreased by 15 percentage points (from 66% to 51%) during the study years. The sense of continuity was linked to several patients&#x02019; experiences of the consultation. The most prominent factor contributing to the sense of continuity of care was having a doctor who was specifically appointed (odds ratio 7.28, 95% confidence interval = 6.65 to 7.96).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Continuity of care was proven to enhance the experienced quality of primary care. Patients felt that continuity of care was best realised when they could consult a doctor who had been specifically appointed to them. Despite efforts of the authorities, over the past 15 years patient-reported continuity of care has declined in Finland.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>continuity of care</kwd><kwd>follow-up study</kwd><kwd>general practice</kwd><kwd>primary health care</kwd><kwd>quality of care</kwd><kwd>questionnaire</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Continuity of care is an essential aspect of good-quality primary care, as is involving patients in assessing, developing, and improving it.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The primary care profession must constantly aim to maintain this.

<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> have assessed the relevance of continuity of primary care in relation to other primary care dimensions and healthcare system outcomes; in their review of the literature, they found associations with coordination, comprehensiveness, quality, efficiency, population health, patient satisfaction, costs, and strength of primary care.</p><p>For the GP, continuity of care:

Furthermore, patients describe consistent relationships in primary care as a reassuring, positive, and secure partnership.<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><boxed-text position="float"><sec><title>How this fits in</title><p>There is extensive literature on the benefits of continuity of care for patients, professionals, authorities, and healthcare systems. The personal continuity of consultations in primary care in Finland is decreasing; this is a matter of concern. This study shows that having a specific named doctor generates continuity and patients experience better quality health care as a result.</p></sec></boxed-text><p>Despite many positive findings in this dimension of general practice, there is ongoing debate as to whether, and to whom, the continuity of care really matters.<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> There is variation between different patient groups and primary healthcare organisations regarding the level of satisfaction with continuity of care.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Patients using primary care services are generally fairly satisfied in this respect.</p><p>Finnish healthcare services offer universal coverage for a comprehensive range of care, which is delivered primarily by organisations that are publicly owned and operated;<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> primary healthcare services are provided mainly by municipal health centres that are publicly funded. The Finnish primary healthcare system is health centre-oriented and wide, both in terms of the numbers of staff and the different professions employed.<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> The actual size and population of primary care health centres varies considerably but staff work mostly in pairs or teams, and the distribution of tasks from doctors to nurses is common. Practice nurses who assess the need and urgency of care are almost invariably patients&#x02019; first contacts, either on the telephone or face to face.</p><p>Only about half of health centres have a personal list system, with all patients allocated to a named family doctor. In addition, free occupational health services also play an important role in Finnish health care by providing primary care to the employed population. In Finland, patients can choose to consult a doctor either in a health centre or in occupational health. They are also able to choose a private doctor, for which they will have to pay extra. In the past 10 years, the authorities in Finland have sought to improve the quality of primary health care, increase its resources and integration of care, and emphasise patients&#x02019; roles in their own care.<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p><p>To the authors&#x02019; knowledge, prior to this investigation, there have been no systematic longitudinal studies measuring continuity of care in Finland.

In every study year, the questionnaire was given to patients attending for treatment during one particular week. The questions were based on international studies<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> and adapted to the special characteristics of Finnish primary health care.<xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p><p>The questionnaire was piloted in the Pirkanmaa area in 1998, given to 19 399 patients and 9276 patients responded (a 48% response rate). In 1999, the study was extended to primary healthcare centres located in the catchment area of Tampere University Hospital. There were 65 health centres in this area, serving a total population of 1.2 million.</p><p>Data were collected during week 39, in September. Reception staff distributed the questionnaire to patients visiting physicians and nurses due to illness from Monday to Friday between 8am and 4pm. Patients placed the anonymously filled questionnaires in a box in the waiting room after their consultation. During the data-collection periods, 363 464 patients visited the practices, and 157 549 responded. The response rate varied yearly from 39% to 53%. The answers of patients (<italic>n</italic> = 97 468) who had visited a doctor during the survey weeks were then analysed.</p><p>Patients were asked for their background information, including:

Responses in the affirmative signified that patients were allocated to a specific doctor by health organisations based on where they lived, without them having the freedom to choose which doctor they would see. From 2009 another question was added: &#x02018;In the last 12 months, how many times have you visited the health centre prior to this visit?&#x02019;.</p><p>The longitudinal, personal, continuity of care was assessed with the question: &#x02018;When visiting the health centre, do you usually see the same doctor?&#x02019;; possible responses were &#x02018;yes&#x02019; and &#x02018;no&#x02019;. The responders graded the quality of service using a scale that is traditional in the Finnish school system and familiar to all patients; grades range from 4 (&#x02018;very poor&#x02019;) to 10 (&#x02018;excellent&#x02019;). The highest score, 10, was considered the best and, therefore, represented the best possible quality. The frequency of this top score was determined for each domain compared with other scores (4&#x02013;9).</p></sec><sec><title>Analyses</title><p>SPSS (version 20.0) was used for statistical analysis. The statistical significance of differences in frequencies between the groups was tested by &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. Binary logistic regression analyses were used on patient characteristics, and on patients&#x02019; evaluation of consultation with their family doctor. To study how the various factors were connected to the continuity of care (dependent variable), both univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used. Patient-related factors and quality factors were dichotomised.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The number of responders varied between questions and study years.

The most clearly determining factor was having a specific doctor appointed by the health centre.

Older patients, in particular, seemed to value having a specific doctor appointed to them, who was able to listen, understand, and care.</p><p>During the study years, 1998&#x02013;2013, the continuity of Finnish primary care did not improve.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This study constitutes the first longitudinal, systematic inquiry into continuity of primary health care in Finland. During the 15-year study period, it was possible to gather an extensive sample of patient opinions on personal continuity of care of health centre doctors. In this study area of 1.2 million inhabitants, there are both small, rural health centres and large health centres in the conurbations. However, the patients who chose to answer the questionnaire were likely to be those who had an opinion and wanted to express it. The responders&#x02019; views cannot be taken as representative of the whole population, therefore, but are likely to be representative of the main population using primary health care services in Finland.</p><p>The number of responders varied greatly during the study years. One of the reasons for this could be organisational and structural changes within, and between, the municipalities arranging primary healthcare services. This may also have been the result of the strengthening of occupational health services. Furthermore, some of the health centres suffered from a lack of professional healthcare staff. Although there were fewer responders, the number of patients visiting health centres also declined. Patients with relatively simple healthcare problems have gradually moved from health centres to occupational health services, while patients with long-term conditions and multimorbidity seem to remain under the responsibility of health centres. These patients also tend to need more services and longer appointments. At the same time it has become harder for people to access primary healthcare centres as resources are stretched.</p><p>Attempts have been made to find out reasons for non-response. Some examples are patients having left spectacles at home or being in a hurry; however, patients may not have completed the questionnaire because they had no desire or inclination to do so.</p><p>The researchers were aware of the challenges of studies using a questionnaire survey.<xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Asking reception staff to pass out questionnaires is flawed as a means of systematic inquiry and involves a notable sampling bias. As the same flaws apply to the data throughout, however, it is reasonable to conclude that comparison over time is still robust. The low overall response rate (45%) is a limitation; nonetheless, the researchers consider the data and the process of assessing patients&#x02019; views to be reliable and comprehensive.<xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> The adoption of the highest score was inspired by its use in other patient-satisfaction measurements.<xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with existing literature</title><p>The results of this study show that patients were less satisfied with the continuity of care at the end of the study, in 2013, than they were at the outset. A number of factors are associated with continuity of care,<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> some of which are related to patient characteristics and some to features of the healthcare system. Several studies have shown that patients&#x02019; age, sex, perceived health status at the time, and socioeconomic status have an effect on continuity of care.<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The variables mentioned did not change significantly in Finland over the course of the study period and those associated with continuity of care here were similar to those in previous studies that used a similar methodology.<xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></p><p>Patients in primary care appreciate continuity;<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> on the other hand, continuity of care alone is not a guarantee of good and efficient health care. The clearest determining factor associated with continuity of care in this study was having a specific doctor appointed by the health centre. Older patients with chronic diseases seem to benefit from the continuity of care and a long treatment relationship with the same doctor and nurse;<xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> in this study, patient age was related to the continuity of care as much as the non-urgency of the visit or previous visits to the doctor.</p><p>Good communication, proper instructions, and confidentiality during the consultation have been shown to increase satisfaction and enhance the continuity of care.<xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> These aspects were also found in this study. When trust and communication between patient and doctor is good enough, the patient tends to be satisfied with, and also committed to, their care.<xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></p><p>There has been some discussion both internationally and also in Finland about whether personal list systems with patients being allocated to a specific named doctor are desirable, and feasible, in a primary care setting.

The question becomes, then, whether authorities are able to put this choice into practice when financial resources in health care are decreasing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Implications for practice</title><p>The declined continuity of care in Finland is far from desirable and it would seem that the number of patients who could most profit from having a specific appointed doctor, that is, from being able to see the same physician, has increased. It is disconcerting that continuity of care has not improved in line with this. Patients who would particularly benefit from having an appointed doctor include those who are fragile, such as older patients with long-term conditions and multimorbidity, and patients who need, or use, the care most, such as drug and alcohol misusers, those who are mentally ill, and young people and families with social problems. These patients could profit from having a care manager, who, together with a team of professionals, would not only integrate and coordinate their care, but also empower patients to take an interest in their own care. The possibility of choosing their own doctor would be ideal for these patients but having a specific family doctor assigned to them would, at least, ensure the continuity of their care.</p><p>This study underlines the importance of the patient in assessing primary care services. It also confirms the significance of having a doctor personally assigned and how aspects of care that indicate good quality care can also promote continuity. The findings also indicate that new means of coordinating and developing care in Finland are still necessary to improve the continuity of primary health care. The authors suggest that, at least, those patients who need care most should be able to consult with a specific family doctor to enhance the continuity and quality of their care.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank to Central Finland and Pohjanmaa area health centres; the Department of General Practice in the medical school of the University of Tampere; and the Centre for General Practice of the Pirkanmaa Hospital District for coordinating, designing, and collecting the data.</p></ack><notes><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This study was financially supported by the Competitive State Research Financing of the Expert Responsibility Area of Tampere University Hospital, Grant number 3349.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical approval</title><p>This study observed the ethical principles prevailing under Finnish law.

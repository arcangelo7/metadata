A wide range of public health disasters &#x02013; including the current Ebola epidemic &#x02013; have drawn attention to the devastation that can rapidly develop in countries with weak health systems.</p><p>The three global symposia, WHO&#x02019;s development of a strategy on health policy and systems research in 2012<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> and the 2013 world health report on research for universal health coverage<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> represent some important milestones in the field. Within the last decade, many collaborations and partnerships have emerged and dedicated entities &#x02013; such as the Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research and the professional society Health Systems Global &#x02013; have been developed. The participation of the United States of America&#x02019;s Global AIDS Coordinator in the Cape Town symposium is one indicator that health policy and systems research is valued by actors who have historically identified with specific disease areas. Such actors are now turning to systems sciences and applying the methods of health policy and systems research to overcome the common challenges of implementation, integration and sustainability.</p><p>Although political engagement will be critical to the strengthening of health systems, it must go beyond those decision-makers who act at national level. Most changes to health systems occur at subnational levels because it is district health officers and senior programme managers who are largely responsible for the implementation of national policies. Policy and systems research &#x02013; including implementation research &#x02013; must be able to respond to the needs of the system. The recently published <italic>Statement on advancing implementation research and delivery science</italic> called for greater engagement of implementers.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref></p><p>While the health-systems landscape of today is a stark contrast to that of the 1980s, the resources available for health policy and systems research remain less than those available for many other areas of health research.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> There is a particular need for efficiency, through alignment, coordination and collaboration. Thematic working groups within the Health Systems Global organization, the use of tools such as the <italic>Health policy and systems research: a methodology reader</italic>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> and its related implementation research guide,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> offer opportunities for learning and synergies. Exercises for setting research priorities &#x02013; such as those led by the Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> &#x02013; can greatly enhance the impact of existing efforts and minimize duplication of work.</p><p>Now that the field has the long-sought attention of the global health community, the key actors need to demonstrate that they can deliver the potential that they have promised. The Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research, Health Systems Global and WHO &#x02013; bringing, respectively, a history of funding this research, broad membership and global convening power &#x02013; are committed to working together to ensure that the full potential of health policy and systems research is realized. As the nature of the challenges experienced by health systems continues to evolve, so too will this field. All key actors will have to engage and collaborate to the fullest extent to ensure that health systems reap the maximum benefits of such research.</p></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="web">Cape Town Statement from the Third Global Symposium on Health Systems Research.

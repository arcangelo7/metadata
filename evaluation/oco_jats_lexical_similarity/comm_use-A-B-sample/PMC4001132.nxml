As far as the study is aware this is a novel finding, which may be a low cost, feasible approach for increasing GP-seeking behaviour among adolescents. Among females there was a minor, non-significant increase in healthcare seeking. In addition, females initially have a higher, and perhaps more adequate use of GPs, as they are more likely to attend when they have a problem. The Committee on Adolescents from the American Academy of Paediatrics<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> states that an adolescence healthcare system should have seven characteristics: availability, visibility, quality, confidentiality, affordability, flexibility, and coordination. The Norwegian regular-scheme GP system meets these demands, except for affordability, as patients of &#x02265;16 years of age must pay a minimal fee for services. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural rights also states that information is a crucial accessibility issue.<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The informative letter was meant as an information tool.</p><p>To the best of the study&#x02019;s knowledge, there are few interventions designed to increase GP contacts among adolescents, but an Australian study has found an increase in intention to contact the GP.<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Strength and limitations</title><p>Norwegian health authorities have been intent on developing a low threshold for use of health services among adolescents, some of which are severely under-utilised particularly by males. The intervention in this study has been shown to help ensure that this objective can be reached.</p><p>The study chose written, personal information to enhance the knowledge of health services and also provided the GP&#x02019;s name, address and other contact information, enabling the adolescent to establish contact easily. Problems and issues were identified by literature studies and the chosen topics were approved by the adolescents in the focus group. The focus group had a strong influence on the wording in the letter and the study believes that this specific information led to the increase in the use of the GPs; yet it is a weakness in the study that these individual factors were not analysed. The average number of contacts per patient, nonetheless, was similar in the control and intervention groups. Using a focus group with teenagers to direct the message in the information letter increased the validity. The reliability of the study is strong, since pooled data from each GP practice was used. There are no lost records and the population studied was considered to represent the average, or slightly above the average, of socioeconomic differences in Oslo and Norway.</p><p>Yet there are some limitations to be considered; because pooled data from the clinics were collected, there is no information on the sex choice of GP among the males and females. In particular, it is not known whether the non-compliance of the two GPs may have influenced the results more than others. Newborns are put on the same GP list as their mothers and as female patients are more likely to choose female GPs, most adolescents are familiar with their mother&#x02019;s doctor, so it would be expected that more female doctors saw the group under study. Data for sex were not collected in the population under study, however, data from school population, and directory of residents established that there are equal numbers of males and females in the study town, and it has been assumed that the study population is comparable. None of the doctors had specific training in &#x02018;friendly caring&#x02019; for adolescents, but two doctors also served in a youth health clinic. When this study was performed, e-mail, SMS were not used as communication tools in the participating surgeries.</p><p>In every municipality, public policies recommend drop-in youth health clinics and school-based health care. In Oslo, where this study was conducted, there is also a clinic for sexually-transmitted diseases and hotlines for support and advice. No reliable information was available on the frequency of use of these services, and it may be seen as a limitation of the study that these factors were not taken into account.</p><p>The fact that a larger proportion of adolescents attended the surgeries may be interpreted as implying that the intervention changed their GP-seeking. However, the number of contacts per patient was unchanged indicating that care given to each patient did not changed.</p><p>This study represents an intervention to improve the contact between adolescents and GPs. GPs have a legal obligation to their populations, and because they represent continuity, they can serve as an interested adult and health carer. Health facilities and healthcare utilisation may both be viewed as protecting factors, according to Blum <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> An information letter to 16-year-olds appears to be one measure for encouraging adolescents to utilise healthcare services.</p><p>This current study compared the intervention group to a historical group. The limitations of an uncontrolled study are acknowledged and although historical data can be confounding, as they do have the potential to give misleading results, these data were from the same GP practices, with the same GPs, and there were no other factors known, such as serious societal events, that would provide confounding issues. The groups are also socioeconomically equal, and comprise students from the same schools.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with existing literature</title><p>This study shows the proportion of patients that contact their GP and number of contacts per year was in accordance with other studies. In this study 54% of the males in the control group and 72% in the intervention group saw a GP during the study year. The corresponding numbers for females were 63% and 66%, respectively. Kramer <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> found that 54% of the adolescents attended the practice in one year. Haavet <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> found similar results in their 2001 Oslo study: 59% of the males and 66% of the females, none of whom had undergone intervention, contacted a GP over the course of the year. In their study there were 1.8 contacts per male and 2.1 per female per year. Correspondingly, Hetlevik <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> found 1.4 contacts per year for males and females combined. The diagnoses were also grouped in the same manner as Hetlevik <italic>et al</italic> did.</p><p>The town that served as the site of this study also runs a youth health clinic, which, unfortunately, does not report its activities.

Another important health issue in adolescents is asthma; Furu <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, who estimated asthma prevalence by using prescription data, found that 5% of 16-year-old males and a greater proportion of females have asthma. Yet only 2.7% of participants in the current study sought support from their GP for asthma. This finding may indicate that asthma is usually treated by physicians other than GPs (such as paediatricians). Sexual health matters, such as sexually transmitted diseases and contraception, are to a great extend solved in the low-threshold services.</p></sec><sec><title>Implication for research and practice</title><p>This study suggests that a personal letter with information to adolescents can facilitate contact with their GP, particularly for males. It is a tool that every GP could start using as it is easily administrated from the practice, and should of course also lead to a youth-friendly practice profile. The intervention should be supported by system training for the whole practice to ensure that young people (especially young males) are well received when they do book GP appointments and attend the practice. More research should be done on what information is crucial and how it alters the adolescent&#x02019;s healthcare seeking pattern. Cooperation between health services in the area as well as adolescents preferences on communication methods will be of interest in future studies. This study was performed in a regular scheme GP system and may be applied whenever the surgery has a defined population responsibility. It is also believed that the information given in the letter may be used in a broader context, for instance in schools.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>Thanks to Truls Skau at F&#x000fc;rst Medical Laboratory who designed the report generator used to extract data from the medical records and to the GPs in the town.</p></ack><notes><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This study was funded by The Norwegian Committee on Research in General Practice and Oslo Medical Association&#x02019;s research fund.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical approval</title><p>Not applicable.</p></sec><sec><title>Provenance</title><p>Freely submitted;

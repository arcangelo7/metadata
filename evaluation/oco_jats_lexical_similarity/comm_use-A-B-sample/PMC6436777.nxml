left superior anomalous pulmonary vein may connect the innominate vein directly
through left vertical vein or may drain in to the coronary sinus, carrying the
oxygenated blood to the venous circulation. Partial anomalous pulmonary venous
return from the right lung is twice as common from the left sided partial anomalous
pulmonary return.</p><p>In this case, the anomalous left superior pulmonary was diagnosed after an accidental
mal-positioning of dialysis catheter into the anomalous left superior pulmonary
vein.</p><p>The following congenital vascular anomalies should be considered in differential
diagnosis.</p><sec><title>Partial Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Drainage</title><p>The pulmonary veins are four blood vessels which drain oxygenated blood from the
lungs to the left atrium of the heart. Embryologically, the pulmonary veins
arise separately and are absorbed into the left atrium to form its smooth
internal surface. Total or partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC
or PAPVC) is a rare heart defect in which all (total) or one or more (partial)
pulmonary veins do not connect normally to the left atrium. The veins are
re-directed to the right atrium or systemic veins by an abnormal connection.
Total anomalous pulmonary circulation invariably exits with Atrial septal
defect<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> and causes
varying degrees of symptoms including cyanosis. It needs an urgent correction
surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Partial Anomalous Pulmonary Vein Connection</title><p>Partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection (PAPVC) is a rare congenital
anomaly and has a reported prevalence of 0.4 - 0.7% and more frequently affects
the right lung (80%) than the left lung<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. The most common form of the partial anomalous
pulmonary vein drainage is an anomalous right upper lobe vein that enters the
Superior vena cava or right atrium<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. While Partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection
(PAPVC) may occur as an isolated anomaly, it is commonly associated with other
congenital cardiac abnormalities. The most common congenital anomaly associated
with Partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection (PAPVC) is an atrial septal
defect (ASD), most commonly a sinus venosus type ASD<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>For the left upper lobe Partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection (PAPVC), it
is commonly connected to the left brachiocephalic vein via a persistent left
vertical vein. Oxygenated venous blood then returns to the right side of the
heart. Depending on the amount of left to right shunt of blood flow through the
anomalous venous connection, patients may present with symptoms of pulmonary
hypertension, be mildly symptomatic or even asymptomatic. Asymptomatic patients
are usually incidentally diagnosed much later in life.</p></sec><sec><title>Persistent Left Sided Superior Vena Cava</title><p>Persistent left sided superior vena cava (PLSVC)<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>, which has got a prevalence of 0.3 - 0.5%, is
the persistence of the left anterior cardinal vein which joins left horn of the
sinus venosus, which later is recognised as coronary sinus. In the commoner
variant, where the persistent left sided superior vena cava (PLSVC) drains into
the RA only via the coronary sinus, the congenital which condition does not pose
any symptomatic issues. In 10% of cases, the persistent left sided superior vena
cava (PLSVC), on its way to the coronary sinus may be unroofed in the Left
atrium, which also can show an arterial blood sample within a venous
structure.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>CASE REPORT</title><p>A 58 year-old male patient presented with history of acute chest pain which was
radiating to the back. He was investigated for acute myocardial infarction but on
subsequent imaging he was found to have acute type A aortic dissection. The urgent
surgery was planned. He underwent acute Stanford Type A aortic dissection
repair.</p><p>On postoperative day 2, the patient was still intubated and ventilated. The urine
output had dropped below 20mls an hour and the creatinine level were increased to
280 micromol/L. The blood gas PH:7.28, PO2: 8.3kpa, PCO2: 5.1, HCO<sub>3</sub>: 22
mEq/L and Lactate 3.2 mmol.</p><p>A conventional double lumen dialysis catheter insertion for continuous veno-venous
haemodialysis through left internal jugular vein was performed by a consultant
intensivist under Ultrasound guidance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure
1</xref>).</p><p>
<fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The chest x-ray shows mal-positioned dialysis catheter.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-34-02-0222-g01"/></fig>
</p><p>As clear from the check chest x-ray film, that the tip of the catheter is abnormally
directed toward the hilum of the left lung, which normally should cross the midline
to the opposite direction. After recognising the abnormal position of the catheter,
the decision was made not to use the dialysis catheter until the confirmation of
location and position is made.</p><p>The chest x-ray landmarks are not typical for the position of the left innominate
vein. The tip of the dialysis catheter is at T6 level and is too close to the carina
at the level of thoracic vertebrae 4/5. The left innominate vein should be much
higher at thoracic vertebrae T2/3 level and it should only join the right innominate
vein past the midline at thoracic vertebra T4 level. Therefore, the appearances
cannot be accepted without further confirmation of the position of the catheter.</p><p>However, the patient remained stable since the line was inserted; no difficulties
were experienced during the line insertion. The chest x-ray does not show a
Pneumothorax, pleural or mediastinal collection.</p><p>An easy and fluent aspiration of the blood from the catheter confirmed the
intravascular position, but the concern still persists.</p><p>Firstly, the blood from both dialysis catheter lumens was tested on a blood gas
machine. The proximal lumen blood sample showed a venous, while the distal lumen
blood sample showed an arterial gas result.</p><p>The suspicion of the proximal lumen into the vein and the distal lumen in an artery
was a significant concern.</p><p>The further evaluation by using the standard pressure transducer was made. Both the
lumens were separately connected to the pressure transducer and both showed the
venous waveform trace. How do we reconcile these confusing findings? Before making
any decision to remove the catheter, an opinion from the colleague radiologist was
requested.</p><p>The contrast chest computed tomography (CT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure
2</xref>) clearly shows the anomalous left superior pulmonary vein, which has
been missed on preoperative CT scan.</p><p>
<fig id="f2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>The contrast CT scan showing anomalous left superior pulmonary vein.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-34-02-0222-g02"/></fig>
</p><p>On the radiologist's advice, a contrast Linogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>) through the dialysis line was performed. Contrast was injected
individually through both the lumens. The first image with the contrast injection
down the proximal lumen showed the contrast moving horizontally and then to the
right.</p><p>
<fig id="f3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>The Linogram shows the anomalous vein draining in left innominate
vein.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-34-02-0222-g03"/></fig>
</p><p>This confirms the catheter's position within the innominate vein. However, the second
injection showed a contrast-filled structure that descends further down to the left
para-mediastinal silhouette, but there was no extravasation of the contrast.</p><p>The two possible diagnoses that came to mind for a venous structure down the left
para-mediastinal silhouette were a persistent Left sided Superior vena
cava<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> or an Anomalous
left sided pulmonary venous drainage to the central systemic veins<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. The Left sided superior vena cava
should travel to the coronary sinus, that does not appear to be the case. Since the
contrast was flowing towards the hilum of the left lung, followed by a branching
pattern into the lung parenchyma confirmed the diagnosis of a partial anomalous left
superior pulmonary vein. Moreover, the arterial blood gas via the distal dialysis
central line supports the diagnosis. The sample of the blood collected from the
proximal lumen confirms that the proximal lumen is in the left innominate vein.</p><p>A review of the preoperative CT scan was also done. Apart of the obvious acute Type A
aortic dissection, the diagnosis of a coexisting pathology had been missed. Since,
it was missed on preoperative scans it is extremely rare to encounter a silent
congenital malformation. The Left superior pulmonary vein emerging from the lung
hilum was clearly seen to ascend and join the left innominate vein. The anatomy of
the remaining pulmonary venous drainage was normal.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this case, after the diagnosis was made, the left dialysis line was safely
removed. The left side was not used again for central lines. There were no immediate
complications related to this unusual situation.</p><p>Had the diagnosis been missed and the dialysis line used, the possibility of left
upper lobe lung injury exists due to forced injection of fluid/blood into the
pulmonary venous system with the possibility of pulmonary oedema or even
haemorrhage.</p><p>In the absence of such congenital venous anomalies, with a similar radiological
finding would have raised the concerns of left innominate vein injury, could have
presented as left sided haemothorax, cardiovascular compromise and possibly a fatal
outcome. The attention to the surgical technique at line insertion, the use of an
ultrasound, the colour of the blood aspirated, the force of the flow of the blood
via the central line are the immediate safeguards. To further assist or in case of
doubt, the pressure transducer and the blood gas analysis should be used. Finally,
every central line must be confirmed with chest x-ray. If any doubt exists, do not
use the line and consult for further advice.</p><p>Incidentally, to our knowledge, there is no etiologic relationship between partial
anomalous pulmonary circulation and acute aortic dissection. But co-existence has
been described in the literature. Turner's syndrome is one example.</p><p>Retrospectively, it did explain intra-operative and post-operative haemodynamic
instability. While weaning the patient off bypass after completion of the procedure,
there was an elevation of the central venous pressure and a sluggish right heart
response. However, in this case the added insult of the Left to Right shunt and
pulmonary hypertension can further compound the problem. Although the lung fields
were clear on the postoperative chest X-ray, there was an initial postoperative
desaturation to 80-85% on 100% of fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>).
Initially, this was difficult to clearly explain. The patient did not have a
coexisting ASD. We postulate the following hypothesis.</p><p>In light of the new finding of PAPVC, the effective systemic oxygen delivery
(DO<sub>2</sub>) is reduced by as much as 20%. We did not calculate the shunt
fraction. Effectively, in addition to the right lung, only half the left lung
contributed to systemic oxygenation. Oxygen saturation can be explained as the ratio
between the oxygen content to the maximum oxygen capacity of unit blood. Given the
theoretical oxygen debt following deep hypothermic circulatory arrest and subsequent
rise in VO<sub>2</sub> post operatively, this mismatch could explain the
desaturation, by the greater fall in oxygen content from increased extraction to the
overall reduced systemic capacity.</p><p>The case also did emphasise to be comprehensive when reviewing clinical
investigations such as the CT Scan beyond the most obvious.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The presence of an anomalous isolated left superior vein drainage is a rare
congenital defect. Team work and the use of new imaging technology can help in
accurate diagnosis of this defect.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="5%" span="1"/><col width="95%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TM</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Substantial contributions to the

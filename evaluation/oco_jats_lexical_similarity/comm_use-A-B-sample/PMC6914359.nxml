<bold>Background</bold>: People living with HIV are at risk of developing
HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) which adversely affects their
quality of life. Routine screening of HAND in HIV care is recommended to
identify clinically important changes in cognitive functioning and allow for
early interventions. However, HAND detection in routine clinical practice has
never been reported in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), partly due to a lack of
adequately standardized screening tools. This review was conducted to identify
the commonly used screening tools for HAND in SSA and document their
psychometric properties and diagnostic accuracy.</p><p id="P4">
<bold>Methods:</bold> We searched Ovid Medline, PsycINFO and Web of Sciences
databases for empirical studies published from 1/1/1980 to 31/8/2018 on HAND
among adults living with HIV in SSA.</p><p id="P5">
<bold>Results:</bold> We identified 14 eligible studies, of which 9 were from
South Africa. The International HIV Dementia Scale (IHDS) was the most
frequently reported tool, being used in more than half of the studies. However
most studies only reported the diagnostic accuracy of this and other tools, with
specificity ranging from 37% to 81% and sensitivity ranging from 45% to 100%.
Appropriate data on construct validity and reliability of tools was rarely
documented. Although most tools performed well in screening for severe forms of
HAND, they lacked sensitivity and specificity for mild forms of HAND.
NeuroScreen, one of the newer tools, yielded good diagnostic accuracy in its
initial evaluation in South Africa (81% to 93% sensitivity and 71% to 81%
specificity).</p><p id="P6">
<bold>Conclusions:</bold> This review identified a lack of adequately
standardized and contextually relevant HAND screening tools in SSA. Most
screening tools for HAND used in SSA possess inadequate psychometric properties
and diagnostic accuracy. There is a need for further validation of existing
tools and development of new HAND screening tools in SSA.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>Screening tools</kwd><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders</kwd><kwd>Adults</kwd><kwd>sub-Saharan Africa</kwd><kwd>Scoping review</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="version-changes"><sec sec-type="version-changes" id="S1"><label>Revised</label><title>Amendments from Version 1</title><p id="P7">Aspects of the paper highlighting the clinical utility of HAND screening

million people living with HIV-1/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) now have the
potential for a near-normal life expectancy<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. Nonetheless, their
wellbeing could be hampered by continuing HIV co-morbidities that adversely affect
quality of life. HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), at least in its mild
form, is one of the commonest comorbidities. Briefly, HAND is a spectrum of
neurological complications of HIV infection comprising asymptomatic neurocognitive
impairment, mild neurocognitive disorder and HIV-associated dementia<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. The diagnosis of HAND is based on the evaluation of
key cognitive domains including executive functioning, episodic memory, motor
skills, and speed of information processing, language, working memory, and sensory
perception according to the Frascati criteria<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. These criteria also consider the extent to which the cognitive impairment
impacts the person&#x02019;s performance on activities of daily living.</p><p id="P9">The prevalence of HAND is estimated to be high across regions, occurring in
as many as 50% of all adults living with HIV, including those on HAART and with
well-controlled viremia<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. Nonetheless, its pattern has changed in the era of
HAART<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. Notably, the incidence of severe
forms of HAND has reduced significantly, while the prevalence of moderate forms has
increased<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. The persistence of milder forms of HAND is
hypothesized to be due to poor adherence to treatment, possible neurotoxicity,
multiple co-morbidities, resistance to drugs, low educational achievement,
irreversible CNS injury before ART initiation (the so-called legacy effect of
untreated HIV), poor CNS penetration of some of the ARV drugs as well as chronic HIV
brain infection<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>.</p><p id="P10">The magnitude of HAND among adults living with HIV, especially in SSA is
largely unrecognized, partly because of the lack of expertise to recognize it and
failure to routinely screen for it. Moreover, there is a paucity of well-designed
epidemiological studies describing the burden of the condition<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>.
Understanding HAND is important because of its clinical and functional impact on the
individual including the heightened risk of mortality<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>; poor treatment adherence<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>;
poor quality of life<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>; increased risk-taking
behaviors<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and disruptions to everyday
functioning<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>.</p><p id="P11">Existing guidelines on the management of HAND almost exclusively originate
from high-income countries. These guidelines recommend that all people living with
HIV be screened for HAND using standardized tools<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. Thereafter, the frequency is contingent on whether HAND is already
present or whether clinical data suggest increased risk for developing HAND.
Additionally, worsening cognitive functioning may necessitate HAART modification
when other causes have been excluded<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. Other
management approaches suggested in the literature include preventative and treatment
strategies supporting the biopsychosocial aspects of cognition, such as reducing
alcohol and substance use, improving nutrition, treating comorbidities, promoting
social contact, reducing depression and stress levels, taking part in cognitively
stimulating activities, applying cognitive remediation therapies, and incorporating
psychopharmacological interventions<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. Nonetheless, there is limited empirical
evidence documenting the appropriateness of the suggested HAND management
approaches. There is a need for more research to build such evidence and after that,
determine which packages of care could potentially be delivered by lay health care
workers through task shifting in low-resource settings. Such an approach could prove
effective in addressing some of the unique challenges facing the SSA region
including inadequate staff with specialized skills, and the many competing
healthcare needs.</p><p id="P12">Despite the potential benefits of early screening, few clinics in SSA screen
for this condition in routine HIV care services. This is partly due to the lack of
adequately standardized tools of neurocognitive functions<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. Another barrier is the prevailing shortage of trained
healthcare personnel with expertise to administer these tests.</p><p id="P13">Information on the most appropriate HAND screening tools in SSA is poorly
addressed. In 2013, Zipursky and colleagues conducted the first systematic review of
the literature with the aim of evaluating brief screening tools for HAND across the
world<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. Out of the 31 studies included
in the past review, only 5 were from SSA. Overall, the review demonstrated that the
commonly utilized screening tools (HIV Dementia Scale (HDS) and the International
HIV Dementia Scale (IHDS)) had poor (0.48) and moderate (0.62) pooled sensitivities,
respectively. The authors further reported that none of the tools differentiated
HAND adequately to suggest wider use. Moreover, substantial methodological flaws
were reported in most of the studies. This included: the failure for the studies to
use the &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; neuropsychological battery as the reference
test, failing to utilize more comprehensive reference tests, non-representativeness
of the samples and the varied measurement of functional status. A recently published
systematic review provided important information on the comprehensive
neuropsychological assessment of NCI in people living with HIV in the SSA<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>.</p><p id="P14">Unlike the recently published review which focused on comprehensive
neuropsychological assessment in SSA, our scoping review focusses on the HAND
screening tools that are being used in the region and document the extent of their
validation. Precisely, we document the psychometric properties of these tools. Key
constructs of reliability and validity are reviewed. Internal consistency (using
Cronbach alpha correlation), test-retest reliability (often measured as correlation,
with Pearson <italic>r</italic>), and inter-rater reliability (generally estimated
by percent agreement, kappa (for binary outcomes), or Kendall tau) will be examined
to describe reliability. For validity, criterion-related validity (predictive,
concurrence) and construct validity (convergent, discriminant)<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> will be evaluated. The focus on SSA is important to
provide context relevant information to guide both clinical and research practice in
the region.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S4"><title>Search strategy</title><p id="P15">A comprehensive database search in Ovid Medline, PsycINFO and Web of

International HIV dementia scale (IHDS) is a brief HAND screening measure made
up of three items assessing motor speed, psychomotor speed and memory
specifically developed for use in low- and middle-income countries<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. It was initially evaluated in Uganda,
where a cut-off of 10 was suggested, yielding a sensitivity of 80% and
specificity of 55%<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. Subsequent
validation studies of the IHDS (included in this review) have reported varied
sensitivity and specificity (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).
Overall, sensitivity ranged from 45% to 100%<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and specificity ranged
from 37% to 79%<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>. Data was unavailable on other key components of

the utility of a modified version of the IHDS in Kenya, the HIV Dementia
Diagnostic Test, (by adding neurological and functional status items). The
modified tool exhibited moderate sensitivity and specificity of 63% and 67%
respectively. Nonetheless, the inter-rater reliability was poor (K =
0.03&#x02013;0.65), with the authors suggesting further training and formal
evaluations for health care workers (HCW) to reliably administer the tool.
Elsewhere in South Africa, Gouse and colleagues<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> evaluated a version of the IHDS which had been modified by adding
a brief self-report cognitive tool. The modified IHDS tool was reportedly more
effective (94% sensitivity, 63% specificity) in screening for severe forms of
HAND than the original IHDS tool (74% sensitivity, 70% specificity).</p><p id="P23">
<bold><italic>HDS.</italic></bold> HDS was originally developed in 1995 as a brief HAND screening tool<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> with four scales designed to screen for
cognitive impairments in attention, motor speed, construction and working memory
domains. Some of the subtests in the original version of HDS were deemed
difficult for administration by non-neurologists and informally trained
individuals, which led to the modified version, the IHDS in 2005<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. In the current review, the study by Olubunmi in
Nigeria demonstrated good HDS sensitivity (97%) and specificity of 80% with a
positive predictive value (PPV) of 91% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of
93%<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>. Nonetheless, the HDS tool was
insensitive to memory impairment in asymptomatic HIV-infected patients.
Likewise, data was unavailable on other key components of validity, such as
test-retest reliability and construct validity.</p><p id="P24">
<bold><italic>Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test.</italic></bold> The MoCA test is a brief screening tool originally developed in 1996 to

So far, only two studies in Africa (as identified in this review) have evaluated
its utility in screening for HAND, both of which were in South Africa<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>. In the initial evaluation study<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, the tool was able to discriminate neurocognitive performance
between HIV-infected and non-infected individuals. However, it has problematic
sections that need to be removed. Additionally, a ceiling effect was observed
with some of the items making the authors conclude that the tool needs extensive
cultural adaptation to make it suitable for South Africa&#x02019;s
linguistically, culturally, educationally, and economically diverse population.
Reliability and construct validity were not explored in this initial evaluation.
In the second evaluation study<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, a
moderate correlation (Pearson&#x02019;s <italic>r</italic> = 0.36) was found
between the tool and reference neuropsychological battery. The tool demonstrated
a sensitivity of 40%, a specificity of 72% and a diagnostic accuracy of 59%.
With these results, the authors concluded that the MoCA test is not a reliable
screening tool for cognitive impairment in HIV-infected patients in rural South
Africa.</p><p id="P25">

America<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>. The measure comprises 10
brief neuropsychological tests assessing verbal learning, memory, processing
speed, attention/concentration, executive functioning and motor functioning. In
Africa, the NeuroScreen has only been evaluated in South Africa<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>. In this review, the sensitivity of the

more than half of the included studies. The other tools reported were: MoCA, HDS,
NeuroScreen, CogState cognitive battery, and the CLQT. Overall, our results show
that most of the commonly utilized HAND screening tools in SSA are inadequately
validated, with most of the studies only reporting specificity and sensitivity while
failing to document important validation constructs notably construct validity and
reliability. Besides, close to two-thirds of the included studies originated from a
single country (South Africa). This potentially limits the generalizability of the
current evidence on screening tools for HAND to other settings in SSA. These results
are similar to earlier reviews on HAND screening tools<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>.</p><p id="P31">Among the identified tools, IHDS had the most data on validation. However,
its validation is suboptimal. Most studies reported only diagnostic accuracy<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>. There is hardly any data
on its construct validity and reliability over time. Besides, the diagnostic
accuracy reported is generally not within the expected range (sensitivity of
&#x02265;80% and specificity of &#x02265;55%) with some studies having very low
specificity (37%)<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and very low sensitivity
(45%)<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> for the IHDS. The huge variation
in the diagnostic accuracy could partly be due to the non-standard definition of
HAND in the different studies and possible sociodemographic and clinical
heterogeneity of the included samples.</p><p id="P32">Generally, the limited data on construct validity and reliability as well as
the variability of diagnostic accuracy of the reviewed studies do not imply that
these measures are less robust and generalizable. This observation calls for more
studies to culturally adapt and validate these measures using well-designed studies
to better understand their performance in the different settings within the region.
With more data, we would be able to accurately determine the psychometric properties
of these tools. Typically, a cut-off value of 70% is recommended when selecting an
optimal screening tool to yield a demanding threshold for type I and II errors.
Besides, screening tools with sensitivity close to a chance level (&#x02264;50%) are
avoided. In principle, high NPV&#x02019;s are regarded as important. Going by this
guidance, many of the reported indexes of sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV
would be inadequate. </p><p id="P33">NeuroScreen, one of the most recent HAND screening tools is promising. Its
initial evaluation in South Africa yielded good diagnostic accuracy when
administered by lay healthcare workers. The tool has the potential to address some
of the unique challenges and gaps facing resource-limited settings in screening for
HAND including difficulty in performing long test batteries, limited screening tools
and a shortage of clinical staff. Nonetheless, more research with larger samples
should be undertaken to validate the tool in several cultural settings in SSA to
clarify its internal and external validity. Some of the issues raised during the
initial evaluation need clarification in further studies including the possibility
of floor effects and practice effects. The MoCA, the other recent screening test, is
gaining momentum in SSA. So far, its validation in SSA has yielded poor criterion
validity, showing best test characteristics when screening for severe forms of HAND,
before it can be widely used, more studies are needed to validate it.</p><p id="P34">It is worth noting that several methodological shortfalls were identified in
the design and conduct of reviewed studies, which need to be considered by
researchers in further validation studies. Some of the studies had small sample
sizes and might have lacked the power to detect differences<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>. There was also a huge variation in the
definition of HAND in the studies. Only nine out of the 14 studies reviewed utilized
a reference neuropsychological battery to define HAND and few considered the
functional consequences brought about by HAND. Additionally, hardly any study
reported construct validity and reliability of the screening measure. It is
imperative that these aspects of validation are conducted and reported to
comprehensively assess the utility of the given tools. </p><p id="P35">There is no doubt that the research on HAND screening is gaining momentum in
the SSA region, as evidenced by an increasing number of studies on the subject.
Nonetheless, there is still a dearth of research on the clinical utility of HAND
screening tools. Feasibility data would be critical in guiding the relevant
stakeholders make informed decisions regarding the screening of HAND. At the moment,
the question as to whether all people living with HIV should be screened for HAND is
an ongoing debate<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. An expert committee drawn
from 30 countries, the Mind Exchange Working Group, recommends the screening of
HIV-infected people early in the disease and then every 6&#x02013;24 months,
regardless of symptoms or risk factors<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>.
Another body, the British HIV Association, shares these sentiments by advocating for
annual screening without giving details of the methods to be used or which
populations to target<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>. Likewise, the
European AIDS Clinical Society recommends that screening should be limited to
patients showing symptoms of cognitive impairment<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>. Generally, universal screening interventions are rarely advocated,
except when the screening strategy is very cheap, the screening measure has high
accuracy, the consequences for being a false positive (such as distress, anxiety and
healthcare costs) are minimal and the consequences of failing to diagnose are grave
(that is, there is a highly effective and cost-effective intervention and a very
poor outcome without the treatment). One important screening strategy could be to
identify known risk factors of HAND (from well-designed epidemiological studies and
clinical practice) and use these to develop a risk score and only screen those with
a higher risk score (this will increase the diagnostic accuracy of the screening
tool). Another strategy could be to train health care workers to be more aware of
the signs and cues of HAND and then conduct indicated screening only on patients
with suggestive signs and symptoms. </p><p id="P36">Our review has the following limitations. Firstly, we did not appraise the
quality of the reviewed articles. Nonetheless, this is a primary limitation of
scoping reviews; by not considering this, our study considered several articles that
would have been excluded in a systematic review. Secondly, it is possible that we
could have missed some articles not cited in the target databases during our
literature search. Thirdly, the variation in the definition of HAND in some of the
included studies may limit the comparison of the screening accuracy of identified
tools across studies.</p><p id="P37">In conclusion, our review shows that there is limited evidence on the
reliability and validity of commonly utilized HAND screening tools in SSA. A clear
majority of the tools are inadequately validated and standardized with most of the
reviewed studies only reporting diagnostic accuracy. Among the studies reporting
diagnostic accuracy, there is substantial variability in sensitivity, specificity,
PPV, and NPV. However, a few promising tools are available such as the NeuroScreen,
but they lack normative data to suggest clinical usefulness. These findings
emphasize the need for well-designed studies to culturally adapt and validate HAND
screening tools within the region. As this work continues, the next step would be to
evaluate the clinical utility of these tools. We acknowledge that this work would
require an ongoing effort to correlate tool factors to theorized constructs of HIV
disease. In addition to this, tool developers need to bear in mind the unique
presentation of certain clients such as those with motor problems who may be
naturally biased when taking HAND screening tests with greater emphasis on motor
functions. The NeuroScreen presents good progress in this direction by assessing
multiple domains of executive functioning, such as working memory and attention.
There is also an important need to understand how the current HAND screening tools
perform amongst those aging with HIV. So far, none of the studies reviewed has
explored this gap in research. </p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="S14"><title>Data availability</title><p id="P38">All data underlying the results are available as part of the article and no

screening tools of HAND in SSA. The authors have done an adequate literature search
despite their reservations and have presented the currently available data on this
very sensitive topic.</p><p id="P46"> Sadly, there is still no consensus on the definition of HAND which makes
comparisons of the different screening tools somewhat superfluous. However, any
attempt at formalising the process is a step in the right direction. A useful
starting point is a clear definition and rigorously tested diagnostic criteria for
HAND. A gold standard using a reference neuropsychological battery is paramount in
the definition of HAND. There is a visible void in published studies of a gold
standard which thereby diminishes the validity of screening tests.</p><p id="P48"> As the authors rightfully assert, screening tools for HAND are hardly ever
performed due to a lack of standardisation. An essential point that is missing in
this review is the difficulty encountered in using the IHDS for patients with
hemiparesis of the non-dominant side, quadiparesis and ataxia which are often
encountered in HIV infected patients presenting to neurology. Such patients require
a test that focuses more on executive functioning rather than motor skills.</p><p id="P50"> This scoping review sufficiently presents gaps in the knowledge of HAND and
its screening. Current screening tests, apart from poor validity also suffer from
not being culture-free. In the endeavour to devise a valid and reliable screening
test for HAND, clinicians and investigators need to take these various issues into
consideration. The test must be valid, reproducible and culture-free to be relevant
for use in all SSA countries. The test must be able to differentiate between
cortical and subcortical dementia and be relevant in an ageing HIV population.</p><p id="P51">I confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an

busy clinical settings. While to some extent, the two problems are linked, the data
do not speak directly to the second, and this is where the authors might consider
moving these aspects down to a more "discursive" section of the paper, rather than

generalisable the measures are. In lesser part, they are critical of the possibility
that studies are limited in power, and by the application of gold standard test
batteries.</p><p id="P61"> In my view, not all of these criticisms are correct or fair. It is true
that #construct_validity has not been properly addressed by researchers. It must be

as the IHDS, each of the 3 sub-items is based on existing neuropsychological
sub-tests, so possibly at least some elements of #construct_validity are dealt with.

isolation when evaluating how HAND was assessed. Some of the studies (in
the 65% figure) did not assess the functional status of the individuals

the Frascati criteria. Such methodological differences make it difficult
to accurately compare such studies. </italic></bold>

This observation calls for more studies to culturally adapt and validate
these measures using well-designed studies to better understand their
performance in the different settings within the region. With more data,
we would be able to accurately determine the psychometric properties of
these tools and determine which ones are consistently performing poorly
and well. Normally, a cut-off value of 70% is recommended when selecting
an optimal screening tool to yield a demanding threshold for type I and
II errors. Besides, screening tools with sensitivity close to a chance
level (&#x02264;50%) are avoided. In principle, high NPV&#x02019;s are

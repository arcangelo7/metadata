outflow tract obstruction and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. The diagnosis can be
made clinically with imaging tests, such as transthoracic echocardiography and
nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. However, even among experienced professionals,
it can be difficult to identify this anomaly by these exams and the definitive
diagnosis is made only during surgery<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Thus, it is important to report this anatomical
alteration so that it is considered a differential diagnosis for obstruction of the
left ventricular outflow tract and its consequences.</p></sec><sec><title>CASE REPORT</title><p>RRF, male, 30 years old, who complained of dyspnea on average efforts since
childhood, with no other associated symptoms, which showed improvement at rest. He
did not present antecedent of angina pain and syncope. Smoker of 20 cigarettes a day
since 15 years of age, without comorbidities or previous surgeries. At physical
examination, cardiac auscultation identified normal rhythmic sound, two-click, with
a holosystolic (3+/6+) audible murmur in aortic and mitral foci, with irradiation to
the left axilla.</p><p>There was no carotid murmur, jugular swelling, hepatomegaly or lower limb edema.
Other systems did not present alterations. The patient was admitted to the Cardiac
Surgery Service for evaluation.</p><p>A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, which showed left ventricular
hypertrophy with presence of subaortic membrane, determining medium/maximum left
ventricular outflow tract gradient of 64/139 mmHg at rest.</p><p>Discrete mitral regurgitation and aortic valve dysplasia with mild to moderate
insufficiency were also noted. The overall systolic performance of the left
ventricle was preserved, with ejection fraction of 75% by the Teichholz method. In
order to correct aortic subvalvar stenosis, the patient was referred to cardiac
surgery via median sternotomy with cardiopulmonary bypass and intermittent cold
blood cardioplegia, the cavas were cleared. Oblique aortotomy and transeptal access
to the mitral valve were performed. During surgery, papillary muscle anomaly, with
two supernumerary muscles inserted at the base of the anterior cusp of the mitral
valve, obstructing the left ventricular outflow tract was identified. There was a
subaortic membrane in the region of the interventricular septum and the aortic valve
was slightly thickened and with prolapse of the non-coronary cusp. The papillary
anomalous muscles and the subaortic membrane were resected through aortotomy after
soft traction of the aortic valve cusps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figures
1</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4</xref>). Finally, a Carpentier 26
ring was implanted in the mitral valve by transeptal access. The patient left
surgery hemodynamically stable, without vasoactive drugs, and was referred to the
Intensive Care Unit of the Service, where he stayed for two days under intensive
care and monitoring.</p><p>

</p><p>After surgery the patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on the fifth
postoperative day. At the time of hospital discharge, a new transthoracic
echocardiogram was performed, which showed mild aortic insufficiency, absence of
mitral regurgitation, and left ventricular outflow tract maximal gradient of 32
mmHg.</p><p>One month after surgery, a 24-hour Holter, which showed no significant changes, and a
new transthoracic echocardiogram, which showed maintenance of mild aortic failure
and absence of mitral regurgitation were performed. The left ventricular outflow
tract maximal gradient was 16 mmHg. The patient remained asymptomatic. After six
months, the patient remained symptom-free and a new echocardiogram revealed mild
aortic and mitral valve thickening, maximum/median gradient through the aortic valve
of 28/18 mmHg and through the mitral valve of 9/4 mmHg, without failure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Papillary muscle abnormalities are congenital anatomical changes identified in cases
of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In order to explain a pathophysiology, Nomura et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>
considered that an anomalous insertion of the papillary muscle is responsible for
the obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract and this may cause secondary
concentric hypertrophy. Another mechanism of obstruction of the left ventricular
outflow tract may be the anterior systolic movement of the mitral valve, caused by
the asymmetric hypertrophy of the interventricular septum and also by the increased
velocity of blood flow through a narrow path, known as the Venturi effect. Del Guzzo
et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>
raised the hypothesis that the constant turbulence of blood flow created by the
obstruction coming from the anomalous papillary muscle could cause fibrosis and
consequent aortic subvalvar stenosis.</p><p>Several papillary muscle abnormalities have been described. Minakata et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>
described as intraoperative findings the presence of fusion of papillary muscle with
the ventricular septum, fusion with a left ventricular free wall, the presence of
accessory papillary muscle and, similar to that described on this report, insertion
of papillary muscle directly at the anterior cusp of the mitral valve. More than one
anomaly may be present in the same patient. The association of papillary muscle
anomaly with subaortic stenosis is described as an even rarer
event<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Clinical findings in patients with papillary anomaly with left ventricular outflow
tract obstruction include effort dyspnea on effort, angina, syncope, systolic murmur
in aortic or accessory aortic focus<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>, as well as left ventricular hypertrophy and
cardiomegaly identified in the 12-lead electrocardiogram and chest X-ray,
respectively<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. Nomura et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> reported an episode of ischemic stroke
due to paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in a patient who had papillary muscle
anomalies associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and absence of stenosis in
cerebral arteries.</p><p>Diagnosis can be made by imaging tests. The transthoracic echocardiogram, besides
evidencing aortic and mitral regurgitation, allows the identification of mitral
anomalies, as a continuity between the papillary muscle and the mitral valve.
However, it should be emphasized that the recognition of papillary muscle
abnormalities may be difficult even for experienced experts, being necessary
incidences different from the common use experience, which consists of a
longitudinal parasternal plane oriented towards the center of the left ventricle
cavity<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. Transesophageal echocardiography and a cardiac
nuclear magnetic resonance are alternative imaging methods for
diagnosis<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. However, due to the difficulty of viewing the
anomaly and the low index of suspicion, the diagnosis can be made during
surgery.</p><p>Surgical correction consists of resection in the anomalous papillary muscle and, when
present, aortic subvalvar stenosis<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. Usually, these procedures are sufficient for
clinical improvement for the patient. However, an associated myomectomy of the
interventricular septum can be performed aiming at reducing the hemodynamic
repercussions of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. The mitral valve should be preserved whenever
possible, especially in young patients<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. For this particular patient, the option was
resection of accessory papillary muscles, resection of the subaortic membrane and
mitral annuloplasty with Carpentier ring as a therapeutic strategy, in order to
promote greater valve support. The evolution was optimal and the patient was
asymptomatic, with competent valves and without significant gradient after 6 months
of the surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>According to literature review the association of papillary muscle anomalies with
subaortic stenosis in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is quite rare. Its identification
by imaging test can be difficult, making the diagnosis only certain during surgery.
Nuclear magnetic image and transesophageal echocardiography could be useful, but
were not performed. Resection of the anomalous papillary muscle, associated with
resection of aortic subvalvar stenosis, when present, is the treatment of choice.
Placement of Carpentier's ring may be an alternative to optimize mitral valve
function, since it should preferably be maintained.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="5%" span="1"/><col width="95%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1"><bold>Authors&#x02019; roles &#x00026;

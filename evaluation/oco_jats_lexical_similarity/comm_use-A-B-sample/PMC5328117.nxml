This will result in more people surviving cancer. It will also be less expensive to treat and cure cancer patients."</p><p>All countries can take steps to improve early diagnosis of cancer, according to WHO&#x02019;s new <italic>Guide to cancer early diagnosis</italic>.</p><p>The three steps to early diagnosis are: improving public awareness of different cancer symptoms and encouraging people to seek care when these arise; investment in strengthening and equipping health services and training health workers; and ensuring people living with cancer can access safe and effective treatment, including pain relief, without incurring personal or financial hardship.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/cancer/publications/cancer_early_diagnosis">http://www.who.int/cancer/publications/cancer_early_diagnosis</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>Measles and rubella vaccination in India</title><p>India has launched one of the world&#x02019;s largest vaccination campaigns against measles and rubella.</p><p>The campaign started on 7 February to vaccinate more than 35 million children in the age group of nine months to 15 years.</p><p>The first phase of the campaign was expected to accelerate the country&#x02019;s efforts to eliminate measles which affects an estimated 2.5 million children every year, killing nearly 49 000 of them.</p><p>The campaign also marks the introduction of rubella vaccine in India&#x02019;s childhood immunization programme to address congenital rubella syndrome which causes birth defects such as irreversible deafness and blindness in nearly 40 000 children every year.</p><p>India has made important efforts and gains against measles in recent years. Measles deaths have declined by 51% from an estimated 100 000 in the year 2000 to 49 000 in 2015.</p><p>This has been made possible by significantly increasing the reach of the first dose of measles vaccine, given at the age of nine months under routine immunization, from 56% in 2000 to 87% in 2015.</p><p>In 2010, India introduced the second dose of measles-containing vaccine in its routine immunization programme to close the immunity gap and accelerate measles elimination.</p><p>Nearly 118 million children aged nine months to 10 years were vaccinated during mass measles vaccination campaigns between 2010 and 2013 in some Indian states.</p><p>Last month&#x02019;s campaign was the first in the series to cover a total of 410 million children across the country over the next two years.</p><p>&#x0201c;Apart from improving the life-chances of millions of children in India, the campaign is expected to have a substantial effect on global measles mortality and rubella control targets as India accounts for 37% of global deaths from measles,&#x0201d; said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, WHO Regional Director for South-East Asia.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.searo.who.int/mediacentre/features/2017/india-measles-rubella-vaccination-campaign">http://www.searo.who.int/mediacentre/features/2017/india-measles-rubella-vaccination-campaign</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>Health needs soar in eastern Ukraine</title><p>A large shipment of WHO interagency emergency health kits was sent to the eastern part of Ukraine to help meet immediate health needs in response to the recent intensification of fighting and shelling there.</p><p>Thousands of civilians are living in sub-zero temperatures and many others are injured and urgently in need of life-saving medical care.</p><p>&#x0201c;The humanitarian situation is dire in the midst of winter as electricity, heat, water and basic services have been disrupted in large parts of Donetsk,&#x0201d; said Dr Marthe Everard, WHO Representative in Ukraine. &#x0201c;Our efforts are focused on ensuring civilians are protected from hostilities and have access to basic services, including essential health care.&#x0201d;</p><p>The Government of Ukraine has organized voluntary medical evacuations for children and vulnerable residents of Avdiivka, a city north of Donetsk, but thousands more in the area may need to be evacuated in the coming weeks due to continued shelling and extreme cold.</p><p>WHO is working with the Government of Ukraine and health partners to ensure, and coordinate, timely delivery of the emergency health kits to hospitals and health clinics. Material for preventive services such as immunization and the detection and treatment of common diseases will also be provided &#x02013; in government-controlled areas, non-government-controlled areas and buffer zones.</p><p>Together with other United Nations agencies and health partners, WHO is making efforts to reduce people&#x02019;s exposure to the cold and to ensure that they have access to heated shelters, regular hot meals and warm clothing.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/emergencies/pages/news/news/2017/02/health-needs-soar-as-fighting-flares-in-eastern-ukraine">http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/emergencies/pages/news/news/2017/02/health-needs-soar-as-fighting-flares-in-eastern-ukraine</ext-link></p><boxed-text id="Bb" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Cover photo</title></caption><p>This man and his wife were living with their children in a settlement for displaced indigenous Emebera Chami people in Caqueta, Colombia in 2013.

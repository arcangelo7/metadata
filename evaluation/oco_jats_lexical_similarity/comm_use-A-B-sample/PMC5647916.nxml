These alternatives embrace novel technologies that are assumed to offer potential to improve care.</p></sec><sec><title>Aim</title><p>To explore the introduction of one online consultation system (Tele-Doc) and how it shapes working practices.</p></sec><sec><title>Design and setting</title><p>Mixed methods case study in an inner-city general practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p>The study was conducted through interviews with IT developers, clinicians, and administrative staff, and scrutiny of documents, websites, and demonstrator versions of Tele-Doc, followed by thematic analysis and discourse analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Three interrelated themes were identified: online consultation systems as innovation, managing the &#x02018;messiness&#x02019; of general practice consultations, and redistribution of the work of general practice. These themes raise timely questions about what it means to consult in contemporary general practice. Uptake of Tele-Doc by patients was low. Much of the work of the consultation was redistributed to patients and administrators, sometimes causing misunderstandings. The &#x02018;messiness&#x02019; of consultations was hard to eliminate. In-house training focused on the technical application rather than associated transformations to practice work that were not anticipated. GPs welcomed varied modes of consulting, but the aspiration of improved efficiency was not realised in practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Tele-Doc offers a new kind of consultation that is still being worked out in practice. It may offer convenience for patients with discrete, single problems, and a welcome variation to GPs&#x02019; workload. Tele-Doc&#x02019;s potential for addressing more complex problems and achieving efficiency is less clear, and its adoption may involve unforeseeable consequences.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>general practice</kwd><kwd>health services accessibility</kwd><kwd>physician&#x02013;patient relations</kwd><kwd>remote consultation</kwd><kwd>technological innovations</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Primary care in England is <italic>&#x02018;reaching saturation point&#x02019;</italic>.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Between 2007 and 2014 the number of consultations with GPs increased by 16%.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In 2015&#x02013;2016, 12% of GP training posts were unfilled.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In the next 5 years, one-third of GPs plan to retire, and 28% plan to become part-time.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> These challenges have prompted calls for alternative models of care, revised skill mix, digital technologies, and increased supported self-management.<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Several technologies provide alternatives to face-to-face consultations.

For example, when Tele-Doc was piloted, GPs were expected to manage three consultations in 10 minutes:
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;When</italic> [Tele-Doc was] <italic>first introduced, it was a bit of an ask.</italic> [Tele-Doc] <italic>was a pilot scheme in addition to our allocated set number of</italic> [clinics]<italic>.

There did not appear to be a clear way forward (<italic>&#x02018;I think, now we are sort of agreed &#x02026;&#x02019;</italic>), suggesting that Tele-Doc consultations will continue to evolve. Hence, while the original aspiration of developers for increased efficiency helped to attract funding (the pilot was funded by the clinical commissioning group (CCG) and a charity), it did not appear that efficiencies had been gained in practice. Tele-Doc was recast as being of <italic>&#x02018;equivalent standing to face-to-face and phone consults&#x02019;</italic> (pilot report), and a new narrative of &#x02018;respite&#x02019; for clinicians during long face-to-face clinics emerged.</p><p>The vision for Tele-Doc had further evolved into an ambition to pioneer online consultation systems widely within primary care, offering what developers described as <italic>&#x02018;a new channel and a new concept&#x02019;</italic> that <italic>&#x02018;time&#x02019;s only going to tell on how this does really pan out&#x02019;</italic>, speculating that it could <italic>&#x02018;completely change the model of general practice&#x02019;.</italic></p></sec><sec><title>Managing the &#x02018;messiness&#x02019; of general practice consultations</title><disp-quote><p>&#x02018;<italic>I really like the way that</italic> [the Tele-Doc document] <italic>goes through the history and you can scan the yes/no bits quite quickly, and they&#x02019;re well flagged for bits that you should pay more attention to.</italic>&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Clinician, Willow Surgery)</attrib></disp-quote><p>Tele-Doc is one expression of a range of contemporary policy and professional developments, including standardisation of care (for example, protocols), a &#x02018;systems&#x02019; approach,<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> aspirations for a 24/7 &#x02018;customer&#x02019; service (three participants drew parallels between Tele-Doc and online banking), and diversification of GP roles to include managerial and commercial ventures.<xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Partners at Forest Group showed considerable flexibility to adapt to this context and embrace its potential for doing things differently.</p><p>A key finding was that Tele-Doc embodied a desire on behalf of the developers to make the consultation less &#x02018;messy&#x02019; &#x02013; to <italic>&#x02018;carve off 10, 20, 30% of the stuff that comes in general practice, that&#x02019;s quite easy&#x02019;</italic> and make it <italic>&#x02018;more streamlined&#x02019;</italic>. These quotes suggest that the &#x02018;easy&#x02019; parts of the consultation are readily identifiable and separable from undifferentiated symptoms. General practice consultations have previously been conceptualised as therapeutic in their own right,<xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> offering patients an opportunity to make sense of their illness by co-constructing narratives in dialogue with their doctor <xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> with a clinician who &#x02018;bears witness&#x02019; to suffering.<xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Face-to-face consultations were described as being more &#x02018;taxing&#x02019; and involving &#x02018;multiple problems&#x02019;:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;Some patients will bring in their child or their partner, or they&#x02019;ll come in with a second or third problem &#x02026; that&#x02019;s where it becomes tiring.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Clinician, Willow Surgery)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>It was precisely this &#x02018;messiness&#x02019; that was difficult to remove from online consultations, with their highly structured organisation. Participants explained that when Tele-Doc was first introduced some patients entered free-text comments into questionnaires designed for conditions unrelated to their own. Patients&#x02019; problems did not always fit neatly into the yes/no boxes provided. Forest Group responded:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;[Developing] <italic>something called the &#x0201c;generic template&#x0201d;, where you go on if you&#x02019;ve got an undifferentiated symptom &#x02026; It was dramatic.

It quickly gained popularity over condition-specific templates. As Morton and Cornwell have argued, the <italic>&#x02018;irreducible variability&#x02019;</italic> implicit in health care presents difficulties when attempts are made to rely on standardising approaches.<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> They go on to suggest that &#x02018;<italic>the only way to eliminate variability completely would be to eliminate patients</italic>&#x02019;.<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Arguably, the online consultation goes some way towards this, albeit it also offers convenience for patients who do not want to travel or wait. Minimising variability may succeed in reducing the emotional labour of consulting (making it less &#x02018;tiring&#x02019;). However, patients appreciate free expression. One clinician speculated upon a possible future with:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;<italic>Tele-Doc automatically recognising that there is nothing here that a GP needs to do.</italic>&#x02019;</p></disp-quote></p></sec><sec><title>Redistribution of the work of general practice</title><disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;&#x0201c;I am doing Tele-Doc.&#x0201d; They</italic> [the other administrators] <italic>all know that means &#x0201c;stay away.</italic>&#x0201d;&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Administrator, Willow Surgery)</attrib></disp-quote><p>One consequence of Tele-Doc was redistribution of work from GPs to administrators and patients. Patients took on consulting work by completing a &#x02018;very thorough history&#x02019;, frequently involving many &#x02018;pages&#x02019; of questions. New organisational routines were worked out by administrators (for example, sorting incoming Tele-Doc templates to identify appropriate recipients, entering Tele-Doc consultations into appointment slots).</p><p>The assumptions underpinning Tele-Doc emphasised standardised working methods (geared towards achieving manageable workloads and efficiency savings) and created new work for administrators (<italic>&#x02018;doing Tele-Doc&#x02019;</italic>) and a shared understanding that staff would not be disturbed when engaged in it. The combination of an extreme case formulation (<italic>&#x02018;all&#x02019;</italic>)<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and the voiced imperative (<italic>&#x02018;stay away&#x02019;</italic>) convey the intensity of this work. The need for &#x02018;more attention and focus&#x02019; was in part to minimise new errors that were possible since integrating Tele-Doc. For example, if a Tele-Doc consultation was allocated an appointment slot in the clinical system, this would prompt an automated text message to the patient (inviting them to an appointment). To avoid this, administrators developed a &#x02018;workaround&#x02019;, booking an &#x02018;unregistered&#x02019; patient instead, then typing the patient&#x02019;s name in small font indicating &#x02018;online consultation&#x02019;.</p><p>Administrators received Tele-Doc templates by email, uploaded them as attachments into electronic records (<italic>&#x02018;a lot of clicking&#x02019;</italic>) and decided how to allocate them. This process was prone to misunderstanding and error. For example, it was possible for unregistered patients to submit templates to Willow Surgery. Patients also used Tele-Doc in unintended ways:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;Some patients use it as a place to complain. They find it is a way to get us to sit up and complain &#x02026; not about Tele-Doc &#x02026; generally about the actual practice.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Administrator, Willow Surgery)</attrib></disp-quote>
<disp-quote><p>The practice had received minor complaints via Tele-Doc (for example, about waiting too long for an appointment) that, although unlikely to warrant a formal complaint, nonetheless demanded attention</p><attrib>(<italic>&#x02018;they &#x02026; get us to sit up&#x02019;</italic>).</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>Uptake of Tele-Doc at Willow Surgery had been low, with 0&#x02013;10 templates submitted daily (one GP said, <italic>&#x02018;We have so few it hasn&#x02019;t really made a dent&#x02019;</italic>). However, the administrative burden was substantial, beginning with reading the completed template to decide whether to &#x02018;book&#x02019; an online consultation (meaning allocate it an appointment slot for GP review), and deciding whether work was clinical or administrative. For example, if on reading the Tele-Doc template administrators decided there was <italic>&#x02018;nothing a doctor really could do over the phone.

Tele-Doc training focused on technical aspects of using the software and was described as &#x02018;superficial&#x02019; or &#x02018;a single training session&#x02019;. None of the participants referred to training about the impact of Tele-Doc on the non-technical aspects of their roles.</p><p>Tele-Doc developers were aware that implementing Tele-Doc was not straightforward. Tele-Doc is now accessible to 231 UK practices, although approximately one-sixth of these practices do not use it:

However, it constituted a significant re-thinking of what it means &#x02018;to consult&#x02019;, and aligned with the contemporary impetus for marketisation, standardisation, and commercialisation.<xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Clinical leads at Forest Group were innovation enthusiasts, viewing technology as a means to improve services, manage demand, and improve efficiency.<xref rid="b45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> However, although the development of Tele-Doc had been successful (in terms of attracting funding, being &#x02018;up and running,&#x02019; and dissemination to 231 practices), implementation appeared less successful (uptake by patients remained low; there was little evidence that efficiency gains were realised). This study suggests that clinicians and administrators worked hard to accommodate Tele-Doc, reshaping their working routines accordingly. This involved new work for administrators, different kinds of work for patients, and a need for clinicians to engage in a process of continual adaptation to embed Tele-Doc into clinical practice. The research suggests that &#x02014; at least for GPs and administrators &#x02014; the assumed potential of Tele-Doc for increased efficiency is difficult to achieve.</p><p>As with other innovations,<xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> further adaptation of Tele-Doc seems likely. Developers and clinicians invested considerable time and resource into Tele-Doc&#x02019;s initial condition-specific templates. However, it was the &#x02018;generic&#x02019; template that proved most popular with patients. This may reflect patients&#x02019; reluctance or inability to commit to a specific condition at the outset of their consultation, or a poor fit between the nature of patients&#x02019; problems and the algorithmic logic inscribed into Tele-Doc. Further research is needed to explore patients&#x02019; experiences of Tele-Doc.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This study was small, undertaken as an MSc project, and focused on staff not patients. It involved one atypical practice &#x02014; an early adopter, closely related to the software developers, and interested in commercial opportunity. Participants were likely to be heavily invested in making Tele-Doc work. As case study researchers, the authors prioritise opportunity to learn over concerns about typicality <xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> and particularisation over generalisation.<xref rid="b49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> Single case studies, like this one, can be valuable in shaping future research in emerging areas, illuminating matters that typical situations might not, and providing in-depth analysis of what actually happens when (as in this case) technologies are implemented in practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with existing literature</title><p>These findings resonate with existing literature that describes the disappointingly low uptake of many novel technologies in healthcare settings,<xref rid="b50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="b52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> concerns that the push for new technologies is driven by the interests of policy and industry rather than clear evidence of patient benefit,<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> and the importance of studying technology-in-practice<xref rid="b54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> as transformation, not just implementation.<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Implications for research and practice</title><p>These findings challenge some of the assumptions underlying current digital health policy (for example, that technology will save time and money). For instance, although the aspiration that <italic>&#x02018;teams</italic> [in general practice] <italic>need support and space if they are to adopt new ways of working&#x02019;</italic>
<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> is welcome, the findings suggest that staff training and support may be insufficient when attempting to introduce new technologies. Ethnography, preferably involving contrasting sites, has potential for illuminating the complexities of introducing online consultation systems.</p><p>Empathy, presence, and compassion are traditionally regarded as important hallmarks of good general practice.<xref rid="b55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> Traditionally, being fully &#x02018;present&#x02019; involves not only physical co-presence in time/space, but may also include emotional, intellectual, and spiritual presence.<xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> This kind of presence is called into question with the emergence of programmes like Tele-Doc, where patient and clinician are not physically present, rarely in dialogue, and communicating asynchronously. Further work involving both patients and practitioners is needed to fully appreciate the consequences of a shift away from physical presence in consultations, and the implications of online consultation systems for the quality of general practice consultations. For example, how is &#x02018;presence&#x02019; negotiated at distance? How is empathy accomplished in alternative modes of consulting? Likewise, the primary care consultation has traditionally been understood to be exception rich, with the GP managing ambiguous and undifferentiated symptoms, tolerating uncertainty,<xref rid="b56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> and bearing the emotional burden that this entails. Tele-Doc may offer convenience for patients with clearly defined problems, and respite from busy clinics for clinicians. However, these findings suggest that the emotional work of consulting may be marginalised, and that there may be important limits about what is achievable in this new genre of consulting.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the participants from the case study sites for their involvement in the study, and the peer reviewers for helpful feedback on the manuscript.</p></ack><notes><sec><title>Funding</title><p>The study was carried out as Michael Casey&#x02019;s dissertation project within an MSc programme in International Primary Health Care.

It was launched as a commercially available product (owned by Forest Group Company, a separate company linked to the Forest Group) in 2014, and is now available for use in 231 UK practices.</p><p>Forest Group includes 19 primary care centres (13 GP surgeries and six urgent-care centres, approximately 100 000 registered patients), based in Cityham, a large city with a diverse, high-density population. Willow Surgery is an inner-city surgery with two GP clinical leads, and four salaried GPs, serving a population of 10 000 patients, of whom 10% do not speak English, and 30&#x02013;40% speak English as a second language.</p><p>Remote consultations in Tele-Doc are accessed through the Willow Surgery website. Patients are offered three options &#x02014; search for specific conditions, ask for general advice (if the patient is not sure of their condition), and request administrative help.</p><p>Patients can search &#x0003e;100 common conditions. These are organised by groups, such as breathing problems, women&#x02019;s health, and mental health, and can also be viewed alphabetically and pictorially by areas of the body. Once a condition is selected, patients can choose self-help information, pharmacy information on relevant over-the-counter medications, direction to the 111 service (a national 24-hour telephone advice service for non-urgent health problems), and a structured online consultation (Tele-Doc). Tele-Doc is available 24 hours a day. Patients can expect a response by the end of the next working day.</p><p>A Tele-Doc consultation begins with patients completing a condition-specific online questionnaire (template) that is submitted to the practice as an email. The questionnaire includes five sections, all of which must be completed.
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>About you (for example, age, contact details).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Your expectations (free-text boxes, limited to 500 characters).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Your condition (systematic questionnaire, with pull-down menus offering tick box answers to multi-level questions on symptoms). Urgent or emergency symptoms prompt the appearance of a red warning box, advising patients to seek urgent/emergency services. If they select &#x02018;End my consultation, I will seek urgent care instead&#x02019;, the information they have entered is not submitted to the GP practice.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Your health (for example, pre-existing conditions).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Review and send to GP.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The template is received by the practice as an email attachment and dealt with according to locally specified organisational routines. There is no real-time consultation, no audio or video component, no instant messaging, and no email exchange with the patient.</p></app></app-group></back></article>

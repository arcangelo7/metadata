grafting (CABG) surgeries. Left or right internal mammary artery, radial arteries,
and great saphenous vein are frequently used as vascular structures. The left
internal mammary artery (LIMA) is the most commonly used one because of its long
patency, ease of application, and graft-coronary match<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Mediastinal bleeding and bleeding in the LIMA bed after CABG, as well as
bleeding/drainage monitored via the tubes placed in the surgical site, are important
complications that could be life threatening. The bleeding itself could be life
threatening and the blood products that are to be given may lead to serious
complications. Is there a relationship between LIMA harvesting technique and
postoperative drainage/bleeding? In general, there are two harvesting techniques.
The first is the pedicled LIMA harvesting. In this technique, LIMA is excised
together with the surrounding tissues. The LIMA that comprises intrathoracic fascia,
veins around the artery, adipose tissue and sometimes muscular tissue is called a
pedicled LIMA. The second is the skeletonized/semiskeletonized LIMA harvesting. In
this technique, LIMA is separated from the surrounding tissue and only the artery is
excised. The LIMA that is excised separately from accompanying veins is called
skeletonized whereas LIMA that is excised together with accompanying veins is called
semiskeletonized.</p><p>The fact that it is within the surgical site and it generally requires opening of the
left thoracic space during harvesting have raised some questions. The effect of
using LIMA on postoperative drainage and the effect of pleural membrane damage
during this procedure on postoperative drainage have been a matter of concern.
Studies conducted to find out an answer to these questions demonstrated that
drainage is in fact less prevalent during bypass surgeries performed without using
LIMA<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. Likewise, it was
reported that drainage is less prevalent when pleural integrity has been preserved
during LIMA harvesting<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Arterial spasm and arterial injury can be less common with pedicled harvesting, in
which arterial contact is minimum or none. Nevertheless, shorter LIMA is obtained as
the tortuous structure has been preserved together with surrounding tissue. The
likelihood of arterial spasm and injury is enhanced in the skeletonized or
semiskeletonized LIMA harvesting technique. This harvesting technique provides a
longer LIMA with less injury to the thoracic wall.</p><p>In the present study, effects of pedicled and semiskeletonized LIMA harvesting
techniques on postoperative drainage were investigated in patients undergoing
off-pump CABG surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Clinical Characteristics of Patients</title><p>The present study comprised a total of 160 subjects who underwent CABG in our
clinic. Data were collected consecutively and retrospectively. Approval was
obtained from the Ethics Committee. An attempt was made to keep the groups
(Group 1, n=65; Group 2, n=95) similar in terms of demographic
characteristics.</p><p>All patients were questioned about their medical history and underwent detailed
physical examination. In the preoperative period, standard preoperative
laboratory analyses, pulmonary function test (Spirobank Spirometry, MIR medical
International Research Product), transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) (Acuson,
Mountain View, Acuson Sequoia C256), and bilateral carotid artery Doppler
ultrasonography (Toshiba XARIO prime ultrasound) were performed in the
Cardiovascular Surgery (CVS) clinic.</p><p>In the preoperative period, clopidogrel (if any) was discontinued 5 days prior to
the surgery and acetylsalicylic acid was discontinued one day prior to the
surgery in patients with coronary artery stenosis who would undergo off-pump
(beatingheart) CABG.</p><p>In order to form two homogenous groups, patients who underwent LIMA-Left anterior
descending artery CABG were not included in our study. Those were few patients
who did not impact the amount of postoperative drainage. We faced surgical
hemorrhage in a patient who was examined for postoperative drainage. Therefore,
those patients were excluded from our study. Sternal wound infection was not
seen in neither group. Postoperative pleural effusions have not been taken into
consideration in the study so as not to cause confusion with the evaluation of
effusions that occur after the drains are removed.</p></sec><sec><title>Surgical Procedure</title><p>Initial isolated CABG surgery was performed in all patients participating in the
study. Fentanyl, midazolam and pancuronium bromide were administered for the
induction of anesthesia. Standard median sternotomy was performed. LIMA and
other vascular conduits (saphenous vein and radial artery) were prepared.
Patients who underwent the beating heart technique were heparinized by
administering 150 IU/kg heparin sodium. Distal anastomoses were performed using
Medtronic Octopus<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Evolution Tissue Stabilizer and
Medtronic Starfish<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Heart Positioners. Whilst the LIMA was
used in all cases, the right internal mammary artery was not used. Great
saphenous vein and radial artery were used as grafts. Meticulous aseptic
technique was implemented in the surgeries. During surgery, the beginnings of
ascending aorta and aortic arch were precisely examined by manipulation. The
procedure was changed in patients in whom plaque was detected by manipulation,
and they were excluded from the study. Unnecessary use of electrocautery was
avoided. Hematocrit and hemoglobin values were monitored every 20 minutes after
the induction of anesthesia until the end of surgery. Intraoperative blood
transfusion was performed when hematocrit values reached 20%. Full
vascularization was performed during CABG surgery. Mediastinum and chest drains
were placed subxiphoidally. Proximal aortic anastomoses were performed using
side clamps. At the end of surgery, an appropriate dose of protamine
hydrochloride (Protamin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> ampoule 1000 IU/1 ml) was
administered to keep the activated coagulation time (ACT) level at 140-150s.

explored up to bifurcation distally and up to the subclavian vein branch
proximally and removed with the help of electrocautery. Great branches (thicker
than 1 mm) were separated from the middle with the help of electrocautery by
placing metal arterial clips both in the LIMA and the sternum side. For smaller
branches, the clip was placed only in the LIMA side and the sternum side was
electrocauterized. In the pedicled harvesting technique, LIMA was excised
including thoracic fascia, adipose tissue, veins around LIMA, lymphatic tissue
and partial muscular tissue by being separated from the branches 1 cm distance
from both sides. In the semiskeletonized harvesting technique, the chest wall
was separated from the thoracic fascia so that there was 1 cm left around the
LIMA. LIMA then became visible and was separated from its branches with the help
of a clip and electrocautery, preserving the veins around it and partially
including the adipose tissue. Thoracic muscular tissue was not damaged in any
way in the semiskeletonized technique. Arterial and venous tissues, which were
made clear of the surrounding adipose tissue as much as possible, were explored
and released. In both techniques, electrocautery was used at low voltage. After
harvesting, LIMA was wrapped in papaverine-impregnated gauze and thoracic
bleeding was checked.</p><p>The left pleura was standardly opened either while preparing LIMA during surgery
or just after the LIMA had been prepared. Inserting mediastinal and left pleural
drains through the subxiphoid area is a standard procedure in our clinic.</p></sec><sec><title>Postoperative Care</title><p>After completion of the surgical procedure, patients were admitted to the CVS
intensive care unit (ICU). They were monitored in the ICU for hematocrit and
hemoglobin at 4-hour intervals. The criterion for blood transfusion in the ICU
was a hematocrit value of 28%.</p><p>In the postoperative period, 300 mg/day acetylsalicylic acid (Coraspin
300<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was commenced together with enteral nutrition.
Cefazolin sodium (Cefamezin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>-IM/IV), which is used as the
standard prophylactic antibiotic in our clinic, was given at a dose of 1 g at 30
min before surgery and every 8 hours after surgery for 72 hours. Blood glucose
regulation in diabetic patients was strictly provided after surgery with insulin
glargine 100 IU/ml (Lantus<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> flacon) and human soluble
regular insulin 100 IU/ml (Humulin-R<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> flacon). Insulin
infusion was not avoided when required. Blood glucose concentration was kept
below 200 mg/dl in all diabetic patients.</p><p>Patients stayed at ICU for 48 hours and then they were admitted to the CVS clinic
in the third 24-hour period after the drains (thoracic and mediastinal drains;
they were kept until the drainage became serous and amount of drainage in the
last 5 hours was 50 cc) and arterial catheters were removed. Central vascular
line was closed on postoperative day 4 in the CVS clinic. The patients were
discharged on postoperative days 6 to 11.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Groups</title><p>Patients underwent off-pump CABG by two surgical teams and were dichotomized
according to two different LIMA harvesting techniques. The first group (Group 1)
consisted of patients in whom LIMA was harvested together with surrounding
tissues using the pedicled technique. The second group (Group 2) consisted of
patients in whom LIMA was harvested with the veins separated from surrounding
connective tissues using the semiskeletonized technique.</p><p>In order to form a homogenous group, dialysis patients or those with creatinine
levels higher than 2 g/dl, patients in whom aortic pathology was detected during
surgery and thereby the surgical procedure had to be changed, patients that
underwent emergency surgery, patients that underwent redo-CABG, and patients
that underwent LIMA-left anterior descending artery (single vascular disease
patients) CABG were not included in the study. Moreover, patients that underwent
valvular and CABG in the same session, that needed postoperative intra-aortic
balloon counterpulsation support, and the cases that were exposed to
postoperative exploration for any reason were also excluded to form more
homogenous and similar groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Subject Characteristics</title><p>Age of all study participants ranged from 27 to 89 years old (mean &#x000b1;
standard deviation 64&#x000b1;4 years old). Of those subjects, 95 (59.4%)
were male and 65 (40.6%) were female. There were 114 (71.3%) subjects with
hypertension, 61 (38.1%) smokers, and 49 (30.6%) patients with chronic

</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>LIMA is the most commonly preferred arterial graft in CABG surgery due to its long
patency, suitability for coronary artery anastomosis, and because it does not
require proximal anastomosis<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. LIMA harvesting technique has
always been a matter of debate for postoperative drainage. In the present study, we
retrospectively investigated the effect of LIMA harvesting techniques on drainage in
patients who underwent off-pump CABG. We determined that drainage was significantly
lower in patients who underwent semiskeletonized LIMA harvesting as compared to
patients who underwent pedicled LIMA harvesting (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001).</p><p>In the wide serial study run by Lamy et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>, they compared the early-phase results of patients who were
subjected to off-pump and on-pump CABG. They showed that the need for drainage and
blood transfusion is less in the group subjected to off-pump CABG. Because there is
a difference between the off-pump and on-pump groups in terms of drainage, by taking
only off-pump CABG patients we compared the effects of the LIMA harvesting
techniques on drainage and proved the superiority of the semiskeletonized group.</p><p>It was reported that skeletonized LIMA harvesting supports sternum nutrition by
preserving collateral flow and reduces wound site complications<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. There are studies reporting that
skeletonized LIMA is longer and provides better free blood flow<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. Moreover, it was demonstrated that postoperative chest pain
is lower and pulmonary function is better with semiskeletonized LIMA
harvesting<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Kamiya et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> demonstrated that
sternal blood flow and oxygen saturation are better with the use of skeletonized
LIMA as compared to pedicled LIMA. In their case study, Boodhwani et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> used bilateral internal mammary
arteries. The LIMA was harvested as skeletonized whereas the right internal mammary
artery was harvested as pedicled. Measuring sternal perfusion of the patients by
scintigraphy, they demonstrated higher perfusion on the skeletonized side versus the
pedicled side. S&#x000e1; et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> conducted a meta-analysis by reviewing 22 articles and
demonstrated that internal mammary arteries harvesting technique influences the
occurrence of sternal wound infection, with lower rate of infection in the
skeletonized IMA group. Again, in another study, S&#x000e1; et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> demonstrated that skeletonized
internal mammary arteries harvesting reduces the incidence of mediastinitis.
S&#x000e1; et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> reported
that skeletonized LIMA harvesting should be considered in diabetic patients.
Sajja<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> determined that
cessation of smoking, optimal control of hyperglycemia, sterile operative condition,
use of appropriate antibiotics, appropriate internal mammary artery harvesting, and
sternal closure reduced mediastinitis.</p><p>There may be considerations that better perfusion of LIMA bed could enhance
postoperative drainage. Atay et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> suggested that preserved pleural integrity reduces
postoperative blood loss independent of LIMA harvesting technique. G&#x000f6;ksin
et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> dichotomized the
patients that underwent pedicled internal mammary artery harvesting according to
whether pleural integrity had been preserved or not. They demonstrated lower rates
of blood loss and drainage in the group in which pleural integrity had been
preserved<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>. In the
present study, we observed differences in drainage due to harvesting technique
though the left pleura had been opened in all patients. Therefore, contrary to the
study conducted by G&#x000f6;ksin et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>, we can say that postoperative blood loss is influenced by
the differences in internal mammary artery harvesting technique rather than pleural
integrity.</p><p>Wimmer-Greinecker et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>
reported that sternum pain is lower in CABG surgeries performed using skeletonized
internal mammary artery. Boodhwani et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> demonstrated that sternal perfusion is better and sternal
pain and tenderness decreases with skeletonized LIMA harvesting. It has been said
that surrounding tissues are less damaged in the skeletonized LIMA group. In
addition, there are changes during harvesting, including in the pathological
process, that are different from the other conduits<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Many studies have mentioned benefits of skeletonized LIMA harvesting technique as
compared to pedicled LIMA harvesting technique. These benefits include increase in
the flow rate of LIMA<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>,
increase in conduit length<sup>[<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>,
decrease in deep sternum infection<sup>[<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>, and decrease in
postoperative sternal pain. Calafiore et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> investigated patency rate of LIMA in patients who underwent
CABG with skeletonized or pedicled internal mammary artery and reported that early
and intermediate patency rates were equal.</p><p>We have not come across any studies concerning the relationship between postoperative
drainage and LIMA harvesting technique. In many recent studies, besides this issue,
the connection between intact pleura and postoperative drainage was investigated.
According to those studies, keeping pleura intact was the most important factor for
decreasing postoperative drainage. However, in our study, the effect of LIMA
harvesting technique on postoperative drainage was investigated in all CABG patients
whose pleural spaces were opened.</p><sec><title>Study Limitations</title><p>In the present study, all patients were Caucasians and therefore do not represent
other ethnic groups. Patients with renal insufficiency, dialysis patients or
redo CABG cases, among others, who would influence the similarity between the
groups, were not included in the study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, it was observed that skeletonized LIMA is more beneficial than
pedicled LIMA in terms of amount of drainage in the first 24-hour and second 24-hour
postoperative and total amount of drainage, regardless of pleural integrity.</p><table-wrap id="t5" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="10%" span="1"/><col width="90%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">M&#x000d6;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Design and drawing of the study; final approval of the</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">manuscript</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">FA</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Analysis and/or interpretation of data; statistical analysis;</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">writing of the manuscript or critical review of its contents;</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">final approval of the manuscript</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was carried out at the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Konya

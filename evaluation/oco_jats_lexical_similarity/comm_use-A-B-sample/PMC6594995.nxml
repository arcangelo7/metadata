Here, we used human urine-derived stem cells (USCs), which were noninvasively harvested from unlimited and easily available urine, as a &#x0201c;factory&#x0201d; to obtain extracellular vesicles (USC-EVs) and demonstrated that the systemic injection of USC-EVs effectively alleviates bone loss and maintains bone strength in osteoporotic mice by enhancing osteoblastic bone formation and suppressing osteoclastic bone resorption. More importantly, the anti-osteoporotic properties of USC-EVs are not notably disrupted by the age, gender, or health condition (with or without osteoporosis) of the USC donor. Mechanistic studies determined that collagen triple-helix repeat containing 1 (CTHRC1) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) proteins are enriched in USC-EVs and required for USC-EV-induced pro-osteogenic and anti-osteoclastic effects. Our results suggest that autologous USC-EVs represent a promising novel therapeutic agent for osteoporosis by promoting osteogenesis and inhibiting osteoclastogenesis by transferring CTHRC1 and OPG.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Osteoporosis</kwd><kwd>Osteoporosis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Excellent Young Scientist Award of National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 81522012), the Thousand Youth Talents Plan of China (Grant No. D1119003); National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 81670807, 81871822), the Thousand Youth Talents Plan of China (Grant No. D1119003), the Medicine and Health Science and Technology Innovation Project of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (Grant No. 2018-I2M-HL-024), the High Level Talent Gathering Project of Hunan Province (Grant No. 2017XK2039, 2018RS3029) and the Innovation Driven Project of Central South University (Grant No. 2016CX028, 2019CX014).</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The National Natural Science Foundation of China (81702237) and the Youth Foundation of Xiangya Hospital in Central South University (Grant No. 2016Q10).</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Central South University (Grant No. 2017zzts032)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant No. 2018M632998).</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Central South University (Grant No. 2018zzts895)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Central South University (Grant No. 2017zzts014)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The Hunan Provincial Innovation Foundation for Postgraduate (Grant No. CX2018B045).</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The Innovation Driven Project of Central South University (2018CX029), Hunan Youth Talent Project (2018RS3029), National Natural Science Foundation of China (81701383) and Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Yong Scholars of Guangdong Province (Grant No. 2016A030306051).</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 81801395), the Hunan Province Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 2017JJ3501) and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant No. 2017M612596).</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 81600699)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Central South University (2017zzts211).</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant No. 2017M622614).</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The National Natural Science Foundation of China(81802138).</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Bone homeostasis is maintained by an orchestrated balance between bone destruction by osteoclasts and bone rebuilding by osteoblasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disorder that occurs when bone breakdown exceeds new bone formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> Thus, therapeutic strategies designed to suppress osteoclastic bone resorption and promote osteoblastic bone formation will be beneficial for osteoporosis prevention and treatment.</p><p id="Par3">Stem cell transplantation has promising therapeutic potential in treating various diseases. Growing evidence indicates that most transplanted stem cells do not engraft into the organs of recipient animals, and a single injection of stem cells is sufficient to alleviate disease phenotypes and maintain therapeutic efficacy for a long time,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> which suggests that the beneficial effects of these cells may be exerted by paracrine molecules. Stem cells are capable of releasing different types of extracellular vesicles (EVs), such as exosomes, microvesicles, etc. These EVs are classified on the basis of their subcellular origin, size, surface marker expression profile, and purification methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> Exosomes, 40&#x02013;150&#x02009;-nm EVs that originate from endosomal multivesicular bodies, are important paracrine mediators that transfer functional proteins and nucleic acids to target cells to evoke regenerative responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> These vesicles, with fewer safety concerns compared with stem cells after administration, provide researchers with a novel mechanism to stimulate bone formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> Since the term exosomes in most of the published articles is generally used to refer to small EVs without determining the intracellular origin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> we thus chose here to use the generic term EVs, independent of the term used in the referenced articles. The local transplantation of EVs from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) is effective in repairing bone defects in ovariectomy-induced osteoporotic rats by promoting osteogenesis and angiogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> The intravenous injection of EVs from healthy mouse bone marrow-derived MSCs (BMSCs) has been found to rescue the impaired osteogenic potential of BMSCs and ameliorate the osteoporotic phenotype in mouse models of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) via the delivery of Fas protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> However, the application of iPSCs is often limited by genetic and epigenetic variations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and obtaining MSCs from the bone marrow is a painful and invasive procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> Hence, identifying a simple, safe, and convenient new source of stem cells to collect EVs for bone remodeling and regeneration is needed.</p><p id="Par4">One such alternative source is urine, which can be harvested by a safe, simple, noninvasive, low-cost, and easily repeatable procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> We and others have confirmed that human urine contains abundant stem cells with MSC-like biological properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> We used human urine-derived stem cells (USCs) as a &#x0201c;factory&#x0201d; to generate EVs (USC-EVs) and found that USC-EVs could enhance skin cell function and accelerate the healing process of skin wounds in diabetic mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> Guan et al. reported the ability of USCs seeded onto a &#x003b2;-tricalcium phosphate scaffold to induce bone healing in rats with femoral defects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> Considering the important role of EVs in cell activity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> we hypothesized that the direct administration of USC-EVs may promote bone formation and prevent the development of osteoporosis. To address this hypothesis, we explored the impact of USC-EVs on bone formation and strength in mouse models of osteoporosis. In addition, the effects of USC-EVs on osteogenic activity and osteoclast formation were also evaluated. Furthermore, the molecules that may mediate USC-EV function in these processes were screened based on proteomic data, and their roles in the USC-EV-induced modulation of osteogenesis and osteoclastogenesis were assessed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>USC-EVs are transported to the bone to enhance bone mass and strength in osteoporotic mice</title><p id="Par5">Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> shows USCs obtained from a healthy adult woman (28-years old).

Previous studies have demonstrated that for each mouse, the injection of 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g of EVs only one time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> or weekly for 2 months<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> is sufficient to induce significant pro-regenerative effects in recipient mice. Based on these studies, a dose of 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g of USC-EVs per mouse was chosen for our in vivo experiments. We labeled the USC-EVs obtained from 28-year-old healthy adult woman-derived USCs with DiR iodide and used a fluorescence tomography imaging system to detect the distribution of DiR-labeled USC-EVs in the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys, brain, femurs, and tibias of OVX mice after intravenous injection for 3&#x02009;h. The results showed high fluorescent signals in the highly vascularized organs, including the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Very high fluorescent signals could also be detected in the mouse femurs and tibias, indicating that large numbers of USC-EVs are transported into bone tissues (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). The fluorescent signals were much lower in the mouse brain compared with those in other organs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>), suggesting that relatively low levels of USC-EVs enter into the brain. We also labeled USC-EVs with DiO and assessed the green fluorescent signals in the above-described tissues after the injection of DiO-labeled USC-EVs for 3&#x02009;h by using a fluorescence microscope. The liver tissue sections were costained with an endothelial marker CD31 to detect whether USC-EVs can enter into endothelial cells. The results confirmed USC-EV uptake by the endothelium and cells in the mouse heart, liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys, brain, femurs, and tibias (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e;</xref> Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>).

As an observation period of 1 or 2 months is usually selected to evaluate the effects of a new treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis in animals,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> we conducted EV treatments weekly for 2 months to assess the effects of USC-EVs on animal models of postmenopausal osteoporosis in our study.

Microcomputed tomography (&#x003bc;CT) analysis indicated that the femurs of OVX mice showed notable osteoporotic phenotypes, as indicated by significantly reduced trabecular bone volume fraction (Tb. BV/TV), trabecular number (Tb. N), trabecular thickness (Tb. Th), and cortical thickness (Ct. Th), as well as increased endosteal perimeter (Es. Pm) and trabecular separation (Tb.

Surprisingly, at 8 weeks after EV injection, all altered parameters induced by OVX were rescued (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f&#x02013;m</xref>), implying that USC-EVs are capable of suppressing the excessive osteoclastic activity or/and augmenting the osteoblastic bone formation to maintain bone mass. A three-point bending test showed that OVX induced a marked decrease in the femur ultimate load value, which represents bone strength; however, the reduction in bone strength was prevented by USC-EVs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1n</xref>).</p><p id="Par8">We also verified the therapeutic effects of USC-EVs from the above-described donor-derived USCs in mouse models of senile osteoporosis and tail suspension-induced hind-limb disuse osteoporosis.

Increases in the periosteal perimeter (Ps. Pm) and Ct. Th induced by USC-EVs in aging mice suggest that USC-EVs have the ability to enhance osteoblastic bone formation.

In vitro, the USC-EVs from nine donors of different ages, genders, and health conditions had the ability to promote osteogenesis and inhibit osteoclastogenesis. Our findings suggest a promising future prospect for autologous USC-EVs to be used as a new treatment for osteoporotic patients.

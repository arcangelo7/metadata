This retrospective analysis investigated the efficacy (based on change in serum ferritin levels) and safety of deferasirox &#x0003e;30 mg/kg per d in adult and paediatric patients with transfusion-dependent anaemias, including &#x003b2;-thalassaemia, sickle cell disease and the myelodysplastic syndromes. In total, 264 patients pooled from four clinical trials received doses of &#x0003e;30 mg/kg per d; median exposure to deferasirox &#x0003e;30 mg/kg per d was 36 weeks. In the overall population there was a statistically significant median decrease in serum ferritin of 440 &#x003bc;g/l (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c; 0&#x000b7;0001) from pre-dose-escalation to the time-of-analysis; significant decreases were also observed in adult and paediatric patients, as well as &#x003b2;-thalassaemia patients. The adverse event profile in patients who received deferasirox doses of &#x0003e;30 mg/kg per d was consistent with previously published data. There was no worsening of renal or liver function following dose escalation. Deferasirox &#x0003e;30 mg/kg per d effectively reduced iron burden to levels lower than those achieved prior to dose escalation in patients with transfusion-dependent anaemias. This has important implications for patients who are heavily transfused and may require higher doses to reduce body iron burden.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>deferasirox</kwd><kwd>efficacy</kwd><kwd>safety</kwd><kwd>transfusion-dependent</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Deferasirox (Exjade&#x000ae;) is a once-daily oral iron chelator approved for the treatment of transfusional iron overload in patients with transfusion-dependent anaemia. During a comprehensive series of 1-year core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Cappellini <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Galanello <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Piga <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Vichinsky <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Porter <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Taher <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>) and ongoing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Porter <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>) extension trials, deferasirox was evaluated at starting doses ranging from 5 to 30 mg/kg per d, with maintenance doses of up to 40 mg/kg per d in the extension trials. The efficacy of deferasirox was primarily evaluated based on the assessment of serum ferritin, which remains the most widely used method for evaluating body iron burden. The measurement of serum ferritin is convenient and inexpensive, and serial measurements provide a relatively robust marker of iron burden; significant correlations between changes in serum ferritin and liver iron concentration (LIC) have been identified across various underlying anaemias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Cappellini <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Porter <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Current guidelines for assessing iron burden and monitoring the efficacy of chelation therapy recommend the use of serum ferritin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Thalassaemia International Federation, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Pharmacological studies have shown that the pharmacokinetics of orally administered deferasirox at doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg per d is linear and drug exposure is dose proportional in patients at steady state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Nisbet-Brown <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). In addition, across the clinical trial programme, response to deferasirox was shown to be dependent on dose. A subsequent analysis based on data from a single study highlighted the additional impact of transfusional iron intake on response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Cohen <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). In this analysis 47%, 55% and 75% of patients in the high (&#x0003e;0&#x000b7;5 mg/kg per d), intermediate (0&#x000b7;3&#x02013;0&#x000b7;5 mg/kg per d) and low (&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;3 mg/kg per d) iron intake categories respectively, achieved a reduction in LIC with 20 mg/kg per d, while the equivalent proportions at a dose of 30 mg/kg per d were 82%, 83% and 96% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Cohen <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Therefore it is clear that some patients require dose escalation to &#x0003e;30 mg/kg per d in order to achieve their therapeutic goals, i.e. to have a sufficiently rapid decrease of iron burden in heavily iron-overloaded patients, or to successfully prevent iron accumulation in patients with acceptable iron burden levels.</p><p>However, when deferasirox was first licensed in 2005, there was a comparatively small clinical database and a limited number of patients had been exposed to doses of &#x0003e;30 mg/kg per d. As such, doses above 30 mg/kg per d were not recommended in the prescribing information for deferasirox when the drug was first approved. As a larger number of patients have now been exposed to deferasirox doses of &#x0003e;30 mg/kg per d for a prolonged period of time, a retrospective analysis has been performed to investigate the efficacy and safety of such doses. Data for this analysis have been pooled from four prospective clinical trials in patients with various transfusion-dependent anaemias, including &#x003b2;-thalassaemia, sickle cell disease (SCD) and the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>Male or female patients aged &#x02265;2 years with transfusional iron overload, as defined by a LIC of &#x02265;2 mg Fe/g dry weight (dw) at the start of deferasirox treatment, were eligible for inclusion in this analysis. All patients were required to have baseline serum creatinine levels below the upper limit of normal (ULN) and were excluded if alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were &#x0003e;250 U/l in the previous year.

Here we report for the first time that such doses are effective with a comparable safety profile to doses of &#x0003c;30 mg/kg per d. The patients who were escalated to doses of &#x0003e;30 mg/kg per d presented with very high median serum ferritin levels prior to escalation (3880 &#x003bc;g/l overall); 208 patients (78&#x000b7;8%) had levels &#x0003e;2500 &#x003bc;g/l, which has been associated with an increased risk of iron overload-related complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Olivieri <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Olivieri &#x00026; Brittenham, 1997</xref>) and shown to require intensification of chelation therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Thalassaemia International Federation, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Despite limited exposure (median 36 weeks), this analysis demonstrates that escalation of deferasirox to doses of &#x0003e;30 mg/kg per d effectively decreased serum ferritin compared with levels prior to dose escalation in patients whose serum ferritin levels were not adequately controlled before escalation. The serum ferritin decreases were significant in the overall population, in adult and paediatric patients, as well as patients with &#x003b2;-thalassaemia. Although patients with SCD and other anaemias were included in this analysis, the patient numbers were too low to provide any meaningful information. This may suggest that iron overload in these populations was sufficiently well managed on deferasirox doses of &#x02264;30 mg/kg per d and they generally did not require escalation to &#x0003e;30 mg/kg per d. However, more than half of the SCD patients (<italic>n</italic> = 18, 56%) had drug interruptions (&#x02265;4 in 78% of patients) after dose escalation, which may have impacted on the serum ferritin response. It is also worth noting that the measurement of serum ferritin levels is a less reliable marker of iron overload in SCD than in other anaemias. This is because ferritin is an acute phase reactant therefore levels can be greatly influenced by inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Brownell <italic>et al</italic>, 1986</xref>), which is an important factor in the pathophysiology of SCD.</p><p>Patients who required escalation to doses of &#x0003e;30 mg/kg per d were heavily iron overloaded, which was reflected by high serum ferritin levels at baseline. These patients also received an intermediate amount of transfusional iron intake (7&#x02013;14 ml/kg per month) after dose escalation. This emphasizes the need to dose deferasirox based on goal of therapy, iron burden and transfusional iron intake, and highlights that dose escalation may be required in patients with severe iron overload who do not respond sufficiently to doses up to 30 mg/kg per d.</p><p>The safety profile observed in patients who received deferasirox doses of &#x0003e;30 mg/kg per d was consistent with that observed in the 1-year core trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Cappellini <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Galanello <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Piga <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Vichinsky <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Porter <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Importantly, there were no AEs observed following escalation to &#x0003e;30 mg/kg per d that were not observed at lower doses before escalation. Serum creatinine levels remained unchanged at the end of study period compared with the pre-escalation level, which suggests that the risk of impaired renal function is low while administering doses of &#x0003e;30 mg/kg per d in heavily iron-overloaded patients. Forty-two patients experienced a serious AE following dose escalation to &#x0003e;30 mg/kg per d, which was consistent with those observed prior to dose escalation and in the 1-year core trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Cappellini <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Galanello <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Piga <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Vichinsky <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Porter <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Taher <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>) and typical of those expected in the target population. The safety of doses &#x0003e;30 mg/kg per d was not assessed in patients with serum ferritin levels &#x02264;1000 &#x003bc;g/l as only one patient had such low levels at dose escalation. It is therefore not possible to comment on the safety of doses &#x0003e;30 mg/kg per d in patients with low levels of iron loading. However, in general, high doses should be reserved for patients with very high levels of iron loading who are not responding to doses &#x0003c;30 mg/kg per d.</p><p>Limitations of this study include the fact that it was a retrospective analysis and patients who were included were likely to be those who tolerated doses &#x0003c;30 mg/kg per d, which is important to consider when reviewing the safety data.</p><p>In conclusion, these findings indicate that escalation of deferasirox doses to &#x0003e;30 mg/kg per d effectively reduces iron burden to lower levels than those achieved prior to dose escalation, without an increase in the incidence of AEs or a worsening of renal or liver function. Deferasirox dose should be titrated to meet individual patient needs as dictated by transfusional iron intake and the goal of therapy (reduction or maintenance of body iron stores). Before considering dose escalation to &#x0003e;30 mg/kg per d to reduce body iron burden in patients with severe iron overload, it is important to assess both the response to therapy (serum ferritin monitoring) and compliance at doses &#x02264;30 mg/kg per d. The dose-escalated patients should be regularly monitored and, once body iron stores fall into an acceptable range, deferasirox dose should be decreased to an appropriate maintenance level.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Financial support for medical editorial assistance was provided by Novartis Pharmaceuticals.

approximately 5% of the population. It is characterized by chronic hemolytic anemia,
recurrent painful vaso-occlusive crisis with progressive multisystemic damage, and
reduced life expectancy<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. However, improvements in its management and the
increase in life expectancy observed in the last decades made possible an increase
in the number of diagnosis of cardiovascular pathologies in patients with sickle
cell anemia, and consequently cardiac surgical procedures are becoming more frequent
in such patients.</p><p>Patients with sickle cell anemia submitted to cardiovascular surgeries with
extracorporeal circulation are exposed to precipitating factors of crisis such as
hypoxia, hypothermia, acidosis, and low flow states. This fact may lead to
significant postoperative complications. For this reason, several precautions should
be taken during transoperative period.</p><p>Due to the lack of evidence, this study aims to report a case of aortic valve
replacement and ascending aortic aneurysmectomy, emphasizing aspects of the
procedure and perioperative management. Currently, there is only one reported case
of this surgery in such patients, which does not specify the management performed,
making it difficult to establish a routine for complex procedures like this.</p></sec><sec><title>CASE REPORT</title><p>A 30-year-old male patient diagnosed with SS sickle cell disease presented with
sickle cell crisis and decompensated heart failure. Echocardiogram showed left
ventricular dilatation (left ventricle end-diastolic diameter of 7.1 cm and
end-systolic diameter of 5.1 cm), an ejection fraction of 53%, and a pulmonary
arterial pressure of 70 mmHg, as well as a bicuspid aortic valve with severe
insufficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). At admission, the
patient had hemoglobin (Hb) of 3 g/dL, hematocrit of 9%, and Hb electrophoresis with
89.3% of hemoglobin S (HbS). Angiotomography showed a 4.8 cm dilatation in the
tubular portion of the ascending aorta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure
2</xref>). As a result of the multiple triggering factors for pulmonary
hypertension, a right cardiac catheterization was performed, which demonstrated mean
pulmonary artery pressure of 56 mmHg, mean capillary pressure of 30 mmHg, and
pulmonary vascular resistance of 8.9 Wood units, characterizing a pulmonary
hypertension by pre and post-capillary components.</p><p>

</p><p>Due to the challenges imposed by the case, a wide discussion was made by the
institution's heart team. Considering the cardiovascular component's contribution in
the symptomatology and that this prevented any reasonable quality of life, a
surgical procedure was indicated.</p><p>In preoperative management, an exchange transfusion was planned aiming at hematocrit
values &#x0003e; 25%, Hb &#x0003e; 10 g/dL, and HbS &#x0003c; 30%. However, simple blood
transfusions were performed daily, which led to a hematocrit of 30.3%, Hb of 10 g/dL
and 27.1% of HbS.</p><p>The patient underwent an aortic valve replacement and ascending aortic aneurysmectomy
in October of 2016 at Hospital de Cl&#x000ed;nicas de Porto Alegre, a tertiary-level
hospital. Anesthetic induction was performed with 12 mg of midazolam, 500 mcg of
fentanyl, and 30 mg of rocuronium. Anesthesia was maintained with 0.7% isoflurane,
midazolam, fentanyl, and rocuronium. Cardiac arrest was achieved by administering 20
ml/kg of Custodiol(r) hypothermic cardioplegia to the coronary ostia, according to
the manufacturer's instructions, additional topical hypothermia was not used. During
extracorporeal circulation, in order to avoid the occurrence of sickle cell crisis,
the patient was maintained in normothermia (nasopharyngeal temperature above 34&#x000ba;C)
and hypoxia and acidosis were avoided, maintaining arterial oxygen saturation
between 97.7% and 99.9%, and serum pH between 7.31 and 7.82. Resection of the native
and ascending aorta was performed with subsequent implantation of a bovine
pericardial prosthesis n&#x000ba; 25 and a supracoronary Dacron tube n&#x000ba; 26. Cardiopulmonary
bypass and ischemic time were 95 and 85 minutes, respectively. There were no
surgical or anesthetic complications. Cell saver was used throughout the procedure.
Coagulation disorders were corrected based on activated clotting and
thromboelastometry tests (ROTEM(r)).</p><p>In the immediate postoperative period, the patient presented hypovolemic shock and
required an exploratory mediastinotomy, which didn't indicate the presence of active
bleeding sites.</p><p>He presented a satisfactory postoperative evolution and he was discharged on the
18<sup>th</sup> postoperative day, presenting complete symptoms resolution. In
an outpatient follow-up, the patient showed significant symptomatic improvement and
absence of major surgical complications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In the reported case, a patient with homozygous sickle cell anemia underwent a major
cardiac surgery. Currently, aortic valve replacement surgery has a class I
indication in patients with symptomatic severe aortic
regurgitation<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Regarding aneurysmectomy, it is recommended in
patients with a bicuspid aortic valve who will undergo aortic valve replacement,
when the diameter of the ascending aorta &#x0003e; 4.5 cm<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. Our patient's
cardiovascular pathology was contemplated by both recommendations.</p><p>In this case, we chose to use a biological valve prosthesis based on various factors.
First, patients with sickle cell anemia have a reduced life expectancy in relation
to the general population. In addition, the use of a mechanical prosthesis would
lead to the chronic use of anticoagulant medications, which are associated with
hemorrhagic complications in anemic patients. Finally, we believe that the use of
mechanical valve prosthesis should be avoided in these patients, since it could
increase hemolysis and the risk of sickle cell crisis.</p><p>Another peculiarity of the reported case was the maintenance of normothermia, since
hypothermia is known as a triggering factor for crisis. Usually, patients are
maintained in mild hypothermia (&#x0003e; 32&#x000ba;C) for myocardial protection and reduction
of the metabolic and oxygen demand. However, hypothermia during cardiovascular
surgeries in patients with sickle cell anemia is controversial. About half of the
published case reports kept the patients normothermic. In those that opted for the
use of hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass, mild hypothermia (&#x0003e; 32&#x000ba;C) was
performed<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. In a series of cases comparing hypothermia (various
degrees) or not during extracorporeal circulation, there was no difference in
complications incidence<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. Considering that our patient had already presented
several sickle cell crisis, we opted to minimize all the possible precipitators of a
new crisis maintaining normothermia during the procedure.</p><p>We also emphasize that great importance has been given currently to the use of
thrombelastography (TEG) and thromboelastometry (ROTEM) in patients undergoing
cardiac surgery. For Kozek-Langenecker et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>, hemostatic treatment guided by TEG or
ROTEM reduces transfusion of both red blood cell, plasma, and platelet concentrate,
providing a more restrictive blood product administration. The use of this
technology allowed us to correct coagulation disorders more specifically and to
focus on the real needs of our patient, avoiding transfusions that could be
unnecessary and would lead to increased morbidity and mortality. Also, the use of
cell-saver - a blood recovery system, which includes aspiration, filter wash, and
then retransfusion of the blood to the patient - avoided homologous blood
transfusions and improved hematocrit during procedure. The use of such technology is
in consonance with current trends, since it is already proven that the number of
transfused red blood cell units is an independent risk factor for clinical
complications or death at 30 days (hazard ratio [HR] for each additional unit
transfused = 1.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1 - 1.4)<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. In the majority of the
cases reported in the literature, there is no objection to the use of cell-saver in
patients with sickle cell disease. However, Sachithanandan et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> say that filtered and washed cell-saved blood is
theoretically more prone to sickle-associated red cell deformation.</p><p>Finally, it was not necessary to perform an exchange transfusion, but simple
sequential transfusions were performed. Collaborated for this fact the long period
that the patient remained hospitalized before his surgery. In this way, it was
possible that HbS levels of 27.1% were reached by various blood transfusions in
sequence. Currently, there is no consensus regarding absolute HbS values for
performing a surgical procedure safely. Nevertheless, it is proposed that it should
be reduced to close to 30% in extensive surgical procedures<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. Some authors recommend
even lower values, such as &#x0003c; 10% for procedures that use extracorporeal
circulation<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. Regarding the fact that an exchange transfusion was
not performed, there is currently no consensus about the transfusion method used to
reach the preoperative goals of Hb and HbS<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. However, most of the cases reported
made use of preoperative exchange transfusion. Regardless of the form of transfusion
used, we believe that it is necessary to reduce as much as possible the
concentration of HbS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Patients with sickle cell disease are subject to many complications during cardiac
surgeries and demand special measures during surgery to avoid those. However, little
is known about the best perioperative management of these patients. This is the
second reported case of a valve surgery combined with ascending aortic
aneurysmectomy in a patient with sickle cell anemia, and we believe that this is the
first case that describes the pre and transoperative management in details. This
case demonstrates that it's possible to perform surgical correction of valvular
pathologies and aortic aneurysms safely in patients with sickle cell anemia despite
the limitations imposed by the disease.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="10%" span="1"/><col width="90%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">LMVS</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Substantial contributions to the

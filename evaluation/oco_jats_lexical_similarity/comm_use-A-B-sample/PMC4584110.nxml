However, the influence of anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy on MRE features of CD severity remains unknown.

The change in CD clinical activity correlated significantly with fluctuations in MRE activity score (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001, <italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.5 for induction; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.004, <italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.7 for maintenance anti-TNF therapy, respectively). Bowel wall thickening, mesenteric lymphadenopathy, and fat wrapping with vascular proliferation were MRE parameters which changed significantly both after the induction and maintenance treatment in patients responding to the therapy. The change in MRE activity score was mostly pronounced during the first 3&#x000a0;months of treatment, when compared to the continuation of the therapy till week 52&#x02013;54 (&#x02212;6 points vs. &#x02212;2 points, respectively; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0008).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p> Transmural and extraintestinal healing seen in MRE correlates with changes in CD clinical activity during anti-TNF therapy, thus MRE seems to be a useful tool in monitoring the efficacy of biological agents.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha therapy</kwd><kwd>Crohn&#x02019;s disease</kwd><kwd>Magnetic resonance enterography</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>In recent years, magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) has become one of the most important diagnostic methods in the assessment of Crohn&#x02019;s disease (CD) activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Due to its non-invasiveness, it can be performed multiple times in the same patient, what enables the dynamic estimation of disease progression or regression in time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF) antibodies are novel potent anti-inflammatory drugs in CD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Nevertheless, it is still a matter of debate, how to monitor the course of anti-TNF therapy. Endoscopy is believed to be a gold standard; however, due to its invasiveness it is questionable to repeat this investigation in a short period of time in all patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. That is why it seems that MRE could be a valuable alternative for endoscopic assessment, and in the case of small bowel CD&#x02014;even a method of choice for dynamic monitoring of the course of anti-TNF therapy. Moreover, MRE also seems to be the most accurate tool in determining so called transmural healing in CD, as it allows to visualize all layers of the gut wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, taking into account a broad spectrum of inflammatory intestinal and extraintestinal CD manifestations in MRE, there are still few data concerning the direct influence of anti-TNF therapy on radiological parameters of CD activity. That is why, due to an increasing role of MRE in diagnostics of CD, there is an urgent need to determine which morphological changes in the inflamed intestines result from anti-TNF therapy. This could help in a better understanding of the mechanisms of the action of biological agents, and it would provide important data on the definition of transmural and extraintestinal healing, as there are still many difficulties in defining this phenomenon. Thus, the main aim of the current study is to assess which radiological features of CD severity in MRE are mostly influenced by anti-TNF antibodies in relation to the efficacy of biological therapy.</p><sec id="Sec5" sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>We retrospectively analysed data from patients with diagnosed CD, who were treated with anti-TNF agents in years 2009&#x02013;2014 in our department. All patients were treated according to the current therapeutic guidelines with either adalimumab (ADA) or infliximab (IFX) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. ADA was administered in the following doses: 160&#x000a0;mg at week 0, 80&#x000a0;mg at week 2, 40&#x000a0;mg every other week till week 12 (7 induction doses), and then in patients responding to induction therapy&#x02014;40&#x000a0;mg every other week till week 52. IFX was administered in the doses of 5&#x000a0;mg/kg body weight at week 0, 2, 6 (3 induction doses), and then in patients responding to induction therapy&#x02014;every 8&#x000a0;weeks till week 52. Response to the induction therapy was defined clinically as a decrease in Crohn&#x02019;s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) by 100 points or more.

There are only few studies assessing the ability of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging techniques to determine the transmural and extraintestinal healing in CD patients treated with anti-TNF agents. First data in this subject concerned MR techniques that were similar, but methodologically different than MRE. Tielback et al. showed in their retrospective analysis including 50 CD patients that the inflammatory scores assessed in MR imaging improved only in individuals, who responded to the therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Van Assche and colleagues performed a multicentre prospective trial, in which magnetic resonance enteroclysis was performed at baseline of anti-TNF treatment, and then at week 2 and 6&#x000a0;months after starting infliximab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Finally, 15 patients were assessed at weeks 2 and 26. The analysis revealed that a decrease of the activity of inflammatory components occurred from 2&#x000a0;weeks after beginning of the therapy. At week 26, the magnetic resonance enteroclysis index improved in 80% of patients; however, only in 13% of them a complete absence of CD activity was noted.</p><p>In the most recent study performed by Ordas et al., the accuracy of MRE in determining the clinical response and mucosal healing in CD patients treated with anti-TNF agents were assessed for the first time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This was a prospective multicentre study in which 48 patients were included, and they underwent ileocolonoscopy (as a reference standard) and MRE at baseline and 12&#x000a0;weeks after starting corticosteroids or anti-TNF therapy. The analysis revealed that the change in the MRE activity estimated with the use of Magnetic Resonance Index of Activity (MaRIA) determined with 90% accuracy the mucosal healing effect and with 83% accuracy&#x02014;the endoscopic remission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, our study is the second one in which the utility of MRE in reflecting the influence of anti-TNF therapy on CD activity was assessed, and it includes the largest cohort of CD patients so far. Our analysis revealed that MRE CD activity changes in parallel with fluctuations of CD clinical activity during both&#x02014;the induction (short-term) and 1-year (long-term) anti-TNF therapy. Almost all parameters assessed routinely in MRE are improving in patients clinically responding to the therapy in parallel to the majority of the laboratory results. Only intraabdominal fistulas were still present after treatment, what is to be expected, as this structural complication of CD is rather an indication for surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, in rare cases other therapeutic options are chosen, as not all patients accept surgery. The second and more frequent scenario is that patients underwent intestinal resection in the past and surgery has to be avoided in order to prevent irreversible complications after multiple intestinal resections, like for example, the short bowel syndrome. That is why some minor proportion of CD patients with intraabdominal fistulas is treated non-surgically, and anti-TNF therapy seems to be the most effective choice in these cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Although statistical analysis showed, that SEAS-CD decreased also in the non-responders group, this change was significantly less pronounced when compared with patients with CDAI-100 response. The decrease in SEAS-CD in patients not responding to the therapy was a consequence of a slight improvement in the minority of SEAS-CD variables; only fat wrapping with vascular proliferation decreased significantly. However, comparison of SEAS-CD scores after the induction anti-TNF therapy shows a significant and very pronounced difference between responders and non-responders group. Moreover, the majority of MRE variables differ significantly in these two groups of patients after the induction therapeutic period (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), what shows that SEAS-CD reliably reflects the course of CD during biological therapy.</p><p>Nevertheless, considering only the non-responders group, anti-TNF treatment leads to transmural and extraintestinal healing to some extent, as well as there is also some improvement in single laboratory tests. However, these phenomena are insufficient to be reflected by regression of CD clinical activity. This is a very interesting phenomenon which was confirmed even on a molecular level. In the study by Leal et al. it was shown that also in patients not responding to the anti-TNF therapy, a big amount of inflammatory parameters involved in CD pathogenesis significantly decreased, although this was not reflected by the improvement of clinical status of the patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. These data and our results suggest that CD symptomatology assessed by CDAI is influenced by multiple pathogenic factors, and only a complex, multifactorial improvement provides clinical response.</p><p>Analysis of the long-term influence of anti-TNF therapy also shows that changes in MRE CD activity parameters correlate with the clinical efficacy of biological agents. Comparative analysis shows that in the case of patients achieving a long-term response to the therapy, the degree of SEAS-CD reduction is significantly more pronounced during the first 3&#x000a0;months of treatment (induction therapy) than during maintenance anti-TNF treatment (mean change in SEAS-CD&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;&#x02212;6 points vs &#x02212;2 points, respectively; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0008). These data show that the strongest potential of anti-TNF agents to induce transmural and extraintestinal healing concerns the first, early period of treatment. Thus, it can be hypothesized, that the degree of the healing effect achieved during the induction anti-TNF therapy is a predictor of further treatment&#x02019;s efficacy. However, it should be mentioned that even after 1&#x000a0;year of biological therapy, there was only one case of a complete recovery from inflammatory lesions seen in MRE (1/13&#x02013;8% of patients in the long-term remission; data not shown).</p><p>In contrast to the induction anti-TNF therapy, which improved almost all MRE parameters of CD activity in the responders group, further clinically successive treatment results only in the significant decrease of bowel wall thickening, mesenteric lymphadenopathy, and fat wrapping with vascular proliferation; however, these data should be interpreted with caution due to a low number of patients experiencing the loss of response to anti-TNF agents. Nevertheless, it can be hypothesized that the aforementioned MRE parameters are mostly influenced by anti-TNF antibodies, and they are responsible to the greatest extent for transmural and extraintestinal healing phenomenon. The question that needs to be answered is whether these observations could be indirectly translated into hypotheses on the mechanisms and primary sites of action of anti-TNF agents. This could be very problematic, however, according to the latest reports on the pathogenesis of inflammatory lesions in CD, it is suggested that one of the crucial roles is played by the mesenteric adipose tissue in which significant vascular proliferation is seen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It was hypothesized that so called creeping fat is a potent source of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other paracrine mediators, as well as it plays a significant role in the immune response to commensal bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In this hypothesis, further transmural inflammatory lesions are a consequence of an unusual transformation of mesenteric fatty tissue, as it was suggested that creeping fat in CD seen in MRE, has several features different from tissue seen in other gastrointestinal diseases, showing more inflammatory and fibrous pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>According to these data, we observed that a significant influence of anti-TNF antibodies, seen in all study groups (short-term and long-term responders, as well as among primary non-responders), concerned only the mesenteric fatty tissue. Thus, one could hypothesize that the primary site of action of anti-TNF antibodies is the mesenteric creeping fat. Hypothetically, the decrease in the CD activity seen in MRE in terms of the mesenteric fatty tissue in the primary non-responders group could be an evidence, that anti-TNF antibodies started to act, but some poorly defined factors did not allow them to lead to further transmural and extraintestinal healing.</p><p>Our study has several limitations. In our opinion, the most important one is the retrospective nature of the analysis. However, as all MRE studies were blinded for the radiologist and then randomly analysed, we believe that this methodological fact reduces the risk of statistical bias. Another possible limitation is the use of concomitant medicines. Although the doses of immunosuppressive drugs were stable during the whole observation, tapering of steroids after finishing the induction phase of anti-TNF therapy or discontinuation of antibiotics were allowed in our study. It could be hypothesized that these facts can bias the interpretation of the direct influence of anti-TNF agents on CD inflammatory activity in MRE. However, in our real-life study group, we could not exclude those patients, as tapering of steroids or discontinuation of antibiotics is a consequence of successful application of anti-TNF antibodies. Moreover, steroids and antibiotics should not be used for a longer period of time. There are also no data regarding the intestinal healing effect of steroids or antibiotics in CD. This phenomenon has been shown only for anti-TNF agents and, to a lesser extent, for immunosuppressive drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Thus, we hypothesize that the fact of tapering the steroids or discontinuing the antibiotics in our study group had limited or even had no influence on intestinal healing seen in MRE, and the observed phenomena in imaging studies are only related to application of anti-TNF antibodies.</p><p>Another possible limitation is the used SEAS-CD scoring system, as it assesses MRE features more on a global level and not on a bowel segment level, as it is done with the MaRIA system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This could be hypothetically problematic in patients in whom one intestinal segment responds to the therapy and other does not; however, such a situation is not likely to occur. Nevertheless, SEAS-CD takes into account the length of inflamed bowel loop, which is quantified and scored separately. Moreover, SEAS-CD scoring system assesses the CD activity (together with quantification of its extent) separately in the jejunum and ileum. That is why, although SEAS-CD does not allow for segmental assessment similar to MaRIA, it takes into account the different CD locations throughout the gastrointestinal tract and its extent in the bowel loops. Thus, it can be even reliable in the hypothetical aforementioned situation of simultaneous response and non-response to anti-TNF therapy in different bowel segments in the same patient.</p><p>To conclude, in our study, we showed that MRE is a useful tool in the assessment of CD course in patients treated with anti-TNF agents. We confirmed that transmural and extraintestinal healing occurs only in individuals responding to the therapy, although, the reduction of the inflammatory lesions seen in MRE takes place to some extent also in the non-responders. The most important compounds of the transmural and extraintestinal healing phenomenon seem to be the bowel wall thickening, mesenteric lymphadenopathy and wrapping of the mesenteric fatty tissue with the vascular proliferation. Data from our study cannot indicate the possible primary site of action of anti-TNF antibodies leading to intestinal healing, although the importance of mesenteric fatty tissue is discussed. There are too few proofs of the crucial role of creeping fat in the efficacy of biological therapy. We hypothesize, however, that our data could be an interesting background for further analyses on the role of mesenteric fatty tissue in anti-TNF therapy of CD.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The study was partially financed by the grant from the Poznan University of Medical Sciences No. 502-14-02223359-10334</p><sec id="d30e1138"><title>Conflict of interests</title><p>P.

Their proposals will be made public on 23 September. </p><p>In October, officials from Member States will be given the opportunity to ask the candidates questions and have virtual discussions with them in a protected web forum hosted on the WHO website. It will be broadcast through a protected website for representatives of Member States and Associate Members who cannot attend.</p><p>The candidates will then be invited to present their vision in person to representatives of WHO Member States and Associate Members and answer questions during a candidates&#x02019; forum of a maximum of three days in November held at WHO headquarters. </p><p>Using a new electronic voting system, WHO&#x02019;s Executive Board will draw up a short list of up to five candidates in January 2017 based on one or more secret ballots. </p><p>Members of the Executive Board will then interview these candidates and nominate up to three of them to go forward to the World Health Assembly (WHA) in May 2017 for the final round of voting.

It calls for openness, dignity, equity and good faith, as well as financial disclosure and avoidance of conflicts of interest.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://apps.who.int/gb/ep/">http://apps.who.int/gb/ep/</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>Tougher action needed on breast-milk substitutes</title><p>Breast-milk substitutes are still being marketed too aggressively in many countries, 35 years after an international code was adopted to promote breastfeeding and, in turn, to protect infant health. </p><p>A new report, released by WHO, the United Nations Children&#x02019;s Fund and the International Baby Food Action Network last month, reveals major gaps in the implementation of the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes.</p><p>Only 39 of the 194 countries analysed had legislation as of March 2016 incorporating all or most of the Code&#x02019;s provisions, a slight increase from 37 in 2011, the new report showed. </p><p>The Code calls on countries to protect breastfeeding by stopping the inappropriate marketing of breast-milk substitutes (including infant formula) and free distribution of feeding bottles and teats.</p><p>But the report, entitled <italic>Marketing of breast-milk substitutes: national implementation of the international Code, status report 2016</italic>, found that only 66 of these countries prohibit the advertising of breast-milk substitutes and 64 prohibit the provision of free samples. </p><p>It found that 49 of these countries prohibit free or low-cost supplies of breast-milk substitutes to health centres, while 60 prohibit gifts of any kind from relevant manufacturers to health workers.</p><p>WHO and UNICEF recommend that mothers exclusively breastfeed infants for the child's first six months to achieve optimal growth, development and health. </p><p>After that, mothers should continue breastfeeding and feed their children other safe and nutritionally adequate foods until two years of age or beyond.</p><p>To support these recommendations, WHO&#x02019;s 194 Member States have committed to increasing the rate of exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months of life to at least 50% by 2025, as one of a set of global nutrition targets.</p><p>Annual sales of breast-milk substitutes amounted to US$ 44.8 billion worldwide in 2014, according to a study published in the <italic>Lancet</italic> in January. </p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/infantfeeding/code_report2016/">http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/infantfeeding/code_report2016/</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>Shorter drug regimens for MDR&#x02013;TB</title><p>New WHO recommendations aim to speed up detection and improve treatment outcomes for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR&#x02013;TB) through use of a novel rapid diagnostic test and a shorter, cheaper treatment regimen.</p><p>&#x0201c;This is a critical step forward in tackling the MDR&#x02013;TB public health crisis,&#x0201d; said Dr Mario Raviglione, Director of WHO&#x02019;s Global TB Programme. </p><p>&#x0201c;The new WHO recommendations offer hope to hundreds of thousands of MDR&#x02013;TB patients who can now benefit from a test that quickly identifies eligibility for the shorter regimen, and then complete treatment in half the time and at nearly half the cost.&#x0201d;</p><p>The new treatment regimen costs less than US$ 1000 per patient and can be completed in 9&#x02013;12 months. The conventional treatment regimens, which take 18&#x02013;24 months to complete, yield low cure rates: just 50% on average globally. </p><p>The shorter MDR&#x02013;TB regimen is expected to improve outcomes and potentially decrease deaths due to better adherence to treatment and reduced loss to follow-up because of the shorter treatment duration. </p><p>This regimen is recommended for MDR-TB patients (adults and children) who do not have resistance to fluoroquinolones or second line injectable agents, the two most effective components of the regimen. </p><p>It is also recommended for individuals who have not yet been treated with second-line drugs and people living with HIV. </p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/tb/areas-of-work/drug-resistant-tb/treatment/resources/">http://www.who.int/tb/areas-of-work/drug-resistant-tb/treatment/resources/</ext-link></p><boxed-text id="Bb" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Cover photo </title></caption></boxed-text><boxed-text id="Bc" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Syrians evacuate an injured man amid the rubble of destroyed buildings in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo last year, following bombardments that severely damaged a local health centre.

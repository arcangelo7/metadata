fermentation residue (BFR) containing <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>
cells and five commercial products that differed in the viability and integrity
of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells to remove aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub>
(AFB<sub>1</sub>) from a citrate-phosphate buffer solution (CPBS). BFR was
collected at a microbrewery and prepared by drying and milling. The commercial
yeast-based products were as follows: inactive intact yeast cells from beer
alcoholic fermentation, inactive intact yeast cells from sugarcane alcoholic
fermentation, hydrolyzed yeast cells, yeast cell walls and active yeast cells.
Adsorption assays were performed in CPBS spiked with 1.0 &#x003bc;g AFB<sub>1</sub>/mL
at pH 3.0 and 6.0 for a contact time of 60 min at room temperature. Analysis of
AFB<sub>1</sub> in the samples was performed by high performance liquid
chromatography. AFB<sub>1</sub> adsorption by the products ranged from 45.5% to
69.4% at pH 3.0 and from 24.0% to 63.8% at pH 6.0. The higher percentages (p
&#x0003c; 0.05) of AFB<sub>1</sub> binding at both pH values were achieved with
products containing hydrolyzed yeast cells or yeast cell walls rather than
intact cells. The AFB<sub>1</sub> binding percentages of BFR were 55.0 &#x000b1; 5.0% at
pH 3.0 and 49.2 &#x000b1; 4.5% at pH 6.0, which was not significantly different (p &#x0003e;
0.05) from commercial products containing inactive intact yeast cells. The
results of this trial indicate that the yeast-based products tested, especially
the BFR, have potential applications in animal feeds as a suitable biological
method for reducing the adverse effects of aflatoxins.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>AFB<sub>1</sub></kwd><kwd>binding capacity</kwd><kwd>decontamination</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="0"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="1"/><ref-count count="17"/><page-count count="5"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> (AFB<sub>1</sub>) is the main metabolite produced by fungi of
the genus <italic>Aspergillus</italic>, primarily <italic>A. flavus</italic> and
<italic>A. parasiticus</italic>, which can contaminate corn, sorghum, oilseeds,
and other food materials (<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">An, 2005</xref>). Various
domestic and experimental species are sensitive to the carcinogenic, mutagenic,
hepatotoxic and immunosuppressive effects of AFB<sub>1</sub>, in which the liver is
the main affected organ (<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">Hussein and Brasel,
2001</xref>).</p><p>Concern about the negative impacts of AFB<sub>1</sub> on animal health and the
agricultural economy led to an investigation of strategies to prevent their
formation, as well as to eliminate, inactivate or reduce their bioavailability in
contaminated products (<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">Hernandez-Mendoza <italic>et
al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Enteroadsorption methods use nutritionally inert
dietary compounds that prevent toxin absorption by the animal gastrointestinal tract
(<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">Gratz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>).
Although several mineral adsorbents are available, their application is limited due
to vitamin and mineral adsorption (<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">Hussein and
Brasel, 2001</xref>). An attractive alternative is the use of microorganisms to
control or eliminate aflatoxins (AF) in food and feed, thus preserving their quality
and safety (<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">Alberts <italic>et al.</italic>,
2009</xref>).</p><p>The adsorptive capacity of yeast cells has been widely studied, and yeast is a
promising candidate for AF decontamination (<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">Aravind
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">Fruhauf <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Stanley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Commercial products made from
either whole yeast cells or partial yeast cells, such as cell wall glucans and
mannans, are used in animal rations not only to facilitate toxin adsorption but also
to improve productivity parameters. Unlike the yeast cells used in ethanol fuel
production from sugar cane, which are often reused throughout the season, the yeast
cells used in beer production are discharged at the end of each process. In addition
to its excellent nutritional value, yeast biomass from beer fermentation has been
hypothesized to be a viable alternative for removing AF, especially considering its
wide availability both worldwide and in Brazil. Therefore, the objective of this
study was to perform <italic>in vitro</italic> tests to verify the ability of beer
fermentation residue to remove AFB<sub>1</sub> from a citrate-phosphate buffer
solution and to then compare the results with those found for five commercial
products made from yeast cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Yeast cell based products</title><p>Beer fermentation residue (BFR) containing cells of <italic>Saccharomyces

</title><p>A standard of AFB<sub>1</sub> (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) was dissolved in
toluene and acetonitrile (9:1), calibrated in a spectrophotometer (Spectrumlab
22PC - Shanghai Lengguang Technology Co. Ltd, Shanghai, China) according to
<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Scott (1990)</xref>, and diluted to obtain a
stock solution containing approximately 10.0 &#x003bc;g AFB<sub>1</sub>/mL. The previous
solution was used in the preparation of other working solutions containing
approximately 1.0 &#x003bc;g AFB<sub>1</sub>/mL in a citrate-phosphate buffer solution
(pH 3.0 and pH 6.0) prepared using a combination of solutions of 0.1 M citric
acid (Synth, Diadema, SP, Brazil) and 0.2 M bibasic sodium phosphate (S&#x000fc;d
Chemie, Jacare&#x000ed;, SP, Brazil). The solvent was completely evaporated by direct
injection of air over a heating bath at 40 &#x000b0;C (TE-019 -Tecnal, Piracicaba, SP,
Brazil).</p><p>The assays evaluating the efficiency of adsorbents to remove AFB<sub>1</sub> from
a contaminated medium were conducted at pH of 3.0 and 6.0 according to <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Ledoux and Rottinghaus (1999)</xref>. For each pH,
0.05 g of each sample was weighed and suspended in 5 mL of buffer solution (pH
3.0 or pH 6.0) spiked with AFB<sub>1</sub> and incubated in an orbital shaker
(TE-140 - Tecnal, Piracicaba, SP, Brazil) at 180 rpm for 60 min at room
temperature. Following this step, centrifugation was performed at 1,800 &#x000d7; g for
10 min (CT-14000 - Cientec, Piracicaba, SP, Brasil), and then 2 mL of the
supernatant was collected and stored at &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C for a subsequent injection into
the High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system. The assays were
performed in triplicate, and we also incubated and analyzed a positive
(AFB<sub>1</sub> in buffer solution) and negative (0.05 g of sample in
buffer solution) control.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantification of AFB<sub>1</sub> by HPLC</title><p>AFB<sub>1</sub> quantification in the buffer solutions was achieved by direct
injection into a Shimadzu HPLC (Tokyo, Japan) system consisting of a
fluorescence detector (RF-10A XL) and an autosampler (SIL-10AF). An ODS column 5
&#x003bc;m 4.6 &#x000d7; 150 mm (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) was used. The system was
stabilized for one hour at a flow rate of 1 mL/min at room temperature. The
mobile phase was a solution of water, acetonitrile and methanol (60:20:20) at a
flow rate of 1 mL/min. The excitation detection was performed at a wavelength of
360 nm, and emission was monitored at 440 nm. Under the above conditions, the
detection limit for AFB<sub>1</sub> was 0.01 ng/mL, and the retention time was
approximately 10.5 min with a retention window of &#x000b1; 10%.</p><p>The quantification of the percentage of AFB<sub>1</sub> adsorbed was performed
using <xref rid="e01" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq. 1</xref>, where A represents

and adopted a rejection level of &#x003b1; = 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>The results obtained for AFB<sub>1</sub> adsorption efficiency by BFR and commercial
yeast-based products in a contaminated medium are presented in <xref rid="t02" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The percentages of toxin adsorption by all
products ranged from 45.5% to 69.4% at pH 3.0 (p &#x0003c; .0001) and from 24.0% to 63.8%
at pH 6.0 (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .0001). The Hilyses and ImmunoWall products had
the best capacity to adsorb AFB<sub>1</sub> at both pH values and were quite similar
(p &#x0003e; 0.05). BFR bound the toxin at 55.0% at pH 3.0 and 49.2% at pH 6.0, which did
not differ significantly from products BFIY and SFIY but did have greater values
than the Saflager product at pH 3.0 or 6.0. Only products BFIY (p = 0.0212), Hilyses

explained that the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cell wall is composed mainly of
polysaccharides (80&#x02013;90%) and that their mechanical strength is due to an inner layer
formed by chains of &#x003b2;-D-glucans. These &#x003b2;-D-glucans are composed of a complex network
of &#x003b2;-(1,3)-D-glucans with a high degree of polymerization branched with
&#x003b2;-(1,6)-D-glucans with a low degree of polymerization. This inner layer is firmly
bound to the plasma membrane by linear chains of chitin, which has a significant
role in the insolubility of the overall structure of the cell and in the packaging
of &#x003b2;-D-glucans, both of which influence the plasticity of the cell wall. The outer
layer of the yeast cell wall is composed of mannoprotein, which plays an important
role in gas and nutrient exchange with the outside environment. The entire structure
is highly dynamic and can vary with the yeast strain, phase of cell cycle, and
growth conditions such as pH, temperature, oxygenation rate, medium nature and
carbon source. Thus, such differences in cell wall composition among yeast strains
may have influenced the ability of the tested products to bind AFB<sub>1</sub> in
the present study because all products included <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells
in their composition but were composed of different strains of the same yeast
species.</p><p>&#x003b2;-D-glucans are the cell wall components responsible for complexation with the toxin,
and the reticular organization of &#x003b2;-D-glucans and their distribution among &#x003b2;-(1,3)
and &#x003b2;-(1 6)-D-glucans plays an important role in this efficacy. In addition, weak
hydrogen bonds and van der Waals bonds are involved in the complex chemical
formation between mycotoxins and &#x003b2;-D-glucans, leading to a chemical interaction of
"adsorption" rather than "contact". Regarding AFB<sub>1</sub>, the toxin is bound to
the glucans due to the interaction between the aromatic ring and the lactone and
ketone groups of the polar form of AFB<sub>1,</sub> as well as by chemical bonds
with glucose units of the single helix &#x003b2;-D-glucans. Thus, the separation of the
yeast cell wall from other cellular components, such as the cytoplasm and
organelles, or the hydrolysis of the cell may expose a greater number of &#x003b2;-D-glucan
units that were not previously available when the yeast cell was intact (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Jouany <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). These
structural changes cause an increase in mycotoxin removal from the medium, which
could possibly explain why the products Hilyses and ImmunoWall had a greater degree
of AFB<sub>1</sub> removal at pH 3.0 and 6.0. However, <xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">Hernandez-Mendoza <italic>et al.</italic> (2009)</xref> found
that the integrity of the bacterial cell wall plays an important role in the process
of AF removal by either viable or non-viable cells. In their study it was shown that
both the bacterial cell wall and its purified fragments were able to remove the AF
from the medium; however, when the cell wall was lost or destroyed due to enzymatic

analyzed 30 commercial products composed of different concentrations of yeast cell
walls and inorganic compounds and found that a higher ash content corresponded to
lower mannan-oligosaccharide and &#x003b2;-glucan content. The authors concluded that the
effectiveness of AFB<sub>1</sub> removal was related to the ash content because
eight products with over 30% of ash had toxin adsorption values over 90%, while
eight of ten products with less than 10% ash showed adsorption rates lower than 25%
in all tested mediums (pH 3.0 and 6.0 and gastric juice).</p><p>As mentioned before, we observed significant differences between the values of
AFB<sub>1</sub> adsorption at pH 3.0 and 6.0 for the BFIY, Hilyses and Saflager
products. <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Raju and Devegowda (2002)</xref> did not
observe differences between pH values when using esterified glucomannan, a yeast
cell wall derivative, at a rate of 0.1% for AFB<sub>1</sub> removal (300 ppb) (80.7%
and 82.5%, pH 3.0 and 6.0, respectively). <xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">Diaz
<italic>et al.</italic> (2002)</xref> found no differences in the removal of
AFB<sub>1</sub> by esterified glucomannan (96.6%) between the pH values analyzed
(pH 3, 7, and 10; pH not adjusted after the addition of 1% of the product).</p><p>Using intact and viable cells of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, <xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">Armando <italic>et al.</italic> (2011)</xref> observed
percentages of AFB<sub>1</sub> (500 ng/mL) removal between 20.2 and 65.5%, depending
on the yeast strain. <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Shetty <italic>et al.</italic>
(2007)</xref> analyzed 18 strains of viable <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> from
fermented corn dough and sorghum beer production and found that seven strains
removed 10&#x02013;20% of AFB<sub>1</sub>, 8 strains removed 20&#x02013;40% and three strains
removed more than 40%, again emphasizing the importance of the strain. These results
were similar to those found in our study for the intact and viable cells present in
the product Saflager (45.5% and 24.0%, respectively for pH 3.0 and 6.0).</p><p>Products containing inactive and intact yeast cells (BFIY, SFIY and BFR) presented
greater values for AFB<sub>1</sub> adsorption than the product containing active and
intact yeast cells (Saflager). Cellular non-viability obtained by heating may
increase the permeability of the outer yeast cell wall due to both the suspension of
mannans from the cell surface and many physical and chemical changes, leading to
increased availability of previously hidden binding sites. The continuity of AF
removal, even after application of heat treatments, confirms once more that yeast
cell viability is not a significant factor in the removal of toxins from the medium
(<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Rahaie <italic>et al.</italic>,
2010</xref>).</p><p>The results of this trial indicated that all the tested yeast-based products
containing cells of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> have the ability to partially
remove AFB<sub>1</sub>
<italic>in vitro</italic>. The binding process was dependent on the conditions in
which yeast cells were produced, including the viability and integrity of these
cells as well as the specificity of each strain. Thus, we conclude that the
yeast-based products tested, especially the BFR, have a potential application in
animal feeds as a suitable biological method for reducing the adverse effects of AF.
However, additional <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments are needed to confirm the
viability of using BFR and other yeast-based products as adsorbents in animal
feeds.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank the financial support of FAPESP- Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Amparo &#x000e0; Pesquisa do

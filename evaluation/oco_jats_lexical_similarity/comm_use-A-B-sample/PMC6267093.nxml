All three were in current use within the Pegg Leditschke Children&#x02019;s Burn centre (PLCBC), the largest paediatric burns centre in Queensland, Australia. Our objective was to find the best performing dressing, following on from previous trials designed to rationalise dressings for the burn wound itself.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">All children for STSG, with thigh donor sites, were considered for enrolment in the trial. Primary outcome measures were days to re-epithelialisation, and pain. Secondary measures were cost, itch, and scarring at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months. Patients and parents were blinded to group assignment. Blinding of assessors was possible with the dressing <italic>in situ</italic>, with partial blinding following first dressing change. Blinded photographic assessments of re-epithelialisation were used. Scar assessment was blinded. Covariates for analysis were sex, age, and graft thickness (as measured from a central biopsy).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">There were 101 patients randomised to the Algisite&#x02122; M (33), Cuticerin&#x02122; (32), and Sorbact&#x000ae; (36) arms between April 2015 and July 2016. All were analysed for time to re-epithelialisation. Pain scores were not available for all time points in all patients. There were no significant differences between the three arms regarding pain, or time to re-epithelialisation. There were no significant differences for the secondary outcomes of itch, scarring, or cost. Regression analyses demonstrated faster re-epithelialisation in younger patients and decreased donor site scarring at 3 and 6&#x02009;months with thinner STSG. There were no adverse effects noted.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par5">There are no data supporting a preference for one trial dressing over the others, in donor site wounds&#x000a0;(DSW) in children.

The donor site wound (DSW) of a split-thickness skin graft (STSG) is one such example. Given the size of these injuries, it is perhaps surprising that more effort has not been devoted to minimising their morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. There is more literature on the treatment of the burn wound itself than there is on treatment of the iatrogenic DSW. Opinion on the best dressing for a DSW often stems from eminence, rather than evidence.</p><p id="Par26">The definition of the &#x02018;best&#x02019; DSW dressing has been the subject of some debate, and there are a number of studies investigating clinician preferences. An ideal DSW dressing does not adhere to the wound, thus facilitating removal. DSW dressings should be pain-free, reduce blood loss, and be changed infrequently, ideally, not until the wound has re-epithelialised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. DSWs are recognised as often being more painful than the STSG recipient site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Most studies focus on short-term effects, such as pain and time to re-epithelialisation. Some of these effects may be synergistic. For example, there are data in children suggesting decreased pain leads to more rapid re-epithelialisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Few studies have investigated the longer-term effects of DSW dressings, such as itch or scarring.</p><p id="Par27">The Pegg Leditschke Children&#x02019;s Burns Centre (PLCBC) treats over 1000 children with new burns annually. Approximately 10% of these children will require a STSG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The PLCBC was already using the three different DSW dressings in this randomised controlled trial (RCT), according to surgeon preference and with no individual dressing predominant. Our objective was to determine the best performing dressing. Our hypothesis was that one DSW dressing would be superior to the others, in aggregate, with respect to the short- and longer-term outcomes defined below. Anecdotally, the dressings perform similarly in the early phases of healing (i.e., during skin re-epithelialisation), so measures of scarring were included, to unmask any potential long-term DSW dressing superiority.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p id="Par28">This study was a single-centre three-arm parallel group prospective, RCT. The trial was registered with the Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Register (ACTRN12614000380695) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It was approved by the Royal Children&#x02019;s Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC/14/QRCH/36), and the University of Queensland Medical Research Ethics Committee (#2014000447). The methodology was specified in advance and documented in a published protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The methods are summarised according to the revised Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The trial was largely completed as per published protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Deviations from the published protocol are highlighted, and their reasons outlined, below.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par29">The PLCBC treats patients under 16&#x02009;years of age. From trial commencement, all consecutive children undergoing STSG were considered for inclusion. Exclusion criteria included non-English-speaking parents/caregivers; children with a known cognitive impairment; children under the care of, or investigation by, the Department of Communities, Child Safety and Disability Services. These exclusions were chosen because of difficulties with subsequent recording of outcomes measures, since many of these were parent/carer reports rather than staff or clinician outcome reports only. Only thigh DSWs were included.</p><p id="Par30">Demographic data and outcome measures were collected in the burns clinic both pre- and post-grafting. Intervention data were collected intraoperatively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Intervention</title><p id="Par31">Prior to the trial there were three DSW dressings in use within the PLCBC; hence, the three arms chosen:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par32">Algisite&#x02122; M, an alginate dressing (Smith &#x00026; Nephew, Hull, UK),</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par33">Cuticerin&#x02122;, a smooth acetate gauze impregnated with water repellent ointment (petrolatum, paraffin and Eucerite&#x000ae;) (Smith &#x00026; Nephew, Hull, UK), and</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par34">Sorbact&#x000ae;, a gauze mesh coated with a dialkylcarbamoyl chloride (DACC; a synthetic fatty acid derivative) and amorphous hydrogel (Abigo Medical AB, Gothenburg, Sweden) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par35">Previously recruited and enrolled patients were randomised intraoperatively immediately prior to definitive DSW dressing application. Where STSGs were harvested from bilateral thighs, a second randomisation was permitted. Each wound constituted its own study entity and was analysed separately. Trial dressings were applied directly to the wound and then covered with Allevyn&#x02122; and a Hypafix&#x02122; securement dressing (Smith &#x00026; Nephew, Hull, UK).</p><p id="Par36">The STSG was harvested in all cases using a pneumatic dermatome (Zimmer Inc., Warsaw, IN, USA) at a depth of 0.007&#x02009;in., our local default setting. The &#x02018;swipe number&#x02019; of the dermatome blade in use at the time, the donor site, and the surgeon harvesting the graft were all recorded. A small lentiform biopsy was taken from the centre of each graft. This was subsequently blocked, cut, and measured for graft thickness in order to provide an objective measurement of the thickness of the graft [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">Local anaesthetic (bupivacaine 0.25% with epinephrine 1:200000 AstraZeneca Pty Ltd., North Ryde, New South Wales 2113, Australia) was applied directly to the wound at a dose of 2&#x02013;2.5&#x02009;mg/kg. Post-harvest topical application, rather than infiltration, was chosen to further standardise the DSW. In longer cases, with larger and/or multiple DSWs, some sites were temporarily dressed with epinephrine/saline-soaked gauze (1&#x02009;mg/1000&#x02009;mL NaCl), with or without local pressure, to facilitate haemostasis. The DSW was formally dressed following dressing of the STSG site.</p><p id="Par38">The majority of patients were sent home that day, following a 4-h review and initial scoring for pain and itch. A follow-up phone call at 24&#x02009;h replicated these questions. Further scores were taken just prior to, and 2&#x000a0;min following, dressing changes. The first dressing change was approximately 1-week post-STSG (nearest weekday), which is our usual pre-trial practice. The DSW dressing was changed first to avoid confounding with pain from the STSG dressing change. The remainder of the protocol has previously been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Primary outcome measures</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Pain</title><p id="Par39">Assessments for pain and distress occurred: (1) 4&#x000a0;h following completion of the STSG operation; (2) 24&#x000a0;h following STSG; (3) prior to dressing removal, and 2&#x000a0;min after dressing removal, for each dressing change until re-epithelialised. Parents/caregivers, nursing staff, and older children (above 3&#x000a0;years) recorded assessments at each of the above time points. Analgesic, sedative, and/or anti-itch medication use was also recorded.</p><p id="Par40">Nursing staff assessing pain and distress used the face, legs, activity, cry, consolability (FLACC) scale. Parents used an 11-point (0&#x02013;10) numeric rating scale (NRS). Children over 3&#x000a0;years used the Revised Faces Pain Scale (FPS-R).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Days to re-epithelialisation</title><p id="Par41">The endpoint was at least 95% re-epithelialisation of the DSW. This was calculated in a number of ways: (1) clinical judgement by the treating consultant, (2) photography using a three-dimensional (3D) camera (3D LifeViz system) and analysis on the Dermapix&#x02122; software (Quantificare, Cedex, France), and (3) blinded review of photographs. DSW assessment took place only during routine planned dressing changes. Three experienced burns surgeons assessed photographs of each DSW to determine at which dressing change the wound was re-epithelialised. Surgeons were blinded to the dressing used, and a consensus opinion determined definitive days to re-epithelialisation for each DSW. This was used for subsequent statistical analyses. Previous studies have demonstrated good inter- and intra-rater reliability when assessing wound re-epithelialisation using photographs when compared to clinical assessments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Secondary outcome measures</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Itch</title><p id="Par42">Itch was scored at the same time points as pain, using the Itch Man Scale. This has been validated in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Itch was further evaluated as a component of the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) when DSW scars were assessed at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Donor site wound scarring and appearance</title><p id="Par43">This was assessed at 3- and 6-month reviews. Multiple methods were used to assess scars: (1) ultrasound measurement of scar thickness, (2) digital 3D photography with edge marking to determine computer mapped areas of scarring, and (3) the POSAS, this latter used as a global rating for DSW scarring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The POSAS has shown superior performance in a systematic review over other scar assessment scales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Both parent and patient were asked, where possible. There are reliability data supporting the use of this scale in children above the age of 6&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Below this age, the parent&#x02019;s opinion was sought as a proxy for the child.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Ease of dressing</title><p id="Par44">Ease of dressing was originally included in the protocol, using a 5-point (0&#x02013;4) NRS. This was subsequently abandoned early in the trial as it was confounded by size of the DSW area and by the levels of anxiety being exhibited by patients and/or carers at the time of removal.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Cost</title><p id="Par45">Cost was assessed using hospital pricing for the dressings used. Additional visits, where required, were also included in the cost analysis. Routine visits were not costed since these are a standard part of care for all arms. A cost-utility analysis was not possible in this trial. The site and nature of the burn wound itself could not be isolated from the DSW in order to perform a cost-utility analysis on the DSW alone.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Sample size</title><p id="Par46">Sample size was calculated from primary outcomes. A minimum clinically important difference (MCID) of 3&#x000a0;days was chosen. This would represent one or more fewer dressing changes for the patient, given dressings were changed every 3&#x000a0;days after the first week. The standard deviation (SD) on DSW re-epithelialisation, from our clinical database, is 4&#x000a0;days. With 80% power, and an alpha of 0.05, 28 participants were required in each arm. This sample size was also adequate to determine an MCID of 2 (SD 2.5) in pain scores using FLACC and the NRS. There were no interim analyses performed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Randomisation</title><p id="Par47">The randomisation sequence was generated using an online program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://stattrek.com/">http://stattrek.com/</ext-link>), with unrestricted simple randomisation in a 1:1:1 ratio. Allocation concealment was via the use of sequentially numbered, sealed opaque envelopes pre-prepared by a third party. Envelopes were only opened in the operating theatre after the STSG had been harvested and immediately before application of the DSW dressing. The sequence was generated by one of the researchers (KS). Participants were enrolled by the study authors and by research assistants. In cases where one of the surgeons (CAM or RMK) was the responsible clinician, recruitment and enrolment were performed by another researcher. Participants had been previously enrolled in the order in which a decision for grafting was made. The nature of operating list bookings in our institution meant the order of recruitment was not the same as the order of randomisation, separating recruitment from randomisation. Randomisation continued until each of the trial arms had a minimum of 28 participants reaching primary endpoints.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Blinding</title><p id="Par48">Full blinding was not possible for all aspects of this study. Each DSW dressing had the same secondary dressing applied, concealing the trial dressing from assessors until the first dressing change. Researchers not present in the theatre assessed outcome measures until the first dressing change. Participants and care providers, as well as assessors, were therefore blinded to dressing.</p><p id="Par49">At the first dressing change, the trial dressing was revealed, since all have a distinctive appearance on removal of the secondary dressing. From that point blinding to pain scores was not possible in the clinic setting, as we were not able to use different staff for each dressing change.</p><p id="Par50">Partial blinding was possible regarding the other primary outcome of re-epithelialisation. In clinic, the surgeon assessing the wound was not blinded to the dressing used. Cuticerin&#x02122; and Sorbact&#x000ae; both leave a partial imprint of the weave in the early phases of re-epithelialisation, making it difficult to distinguish between the two dressings. Algisite M&#x02122; is often difficult to completely remove from the wound. Three surgeons (CAM, RMK, one other) subsequently viewed and scored digital photographs of the wound at each dressing change. These assessors were partially blinded to which arm of the trial the patient was in. Full blinding was not possible here, as surgeons occasionally recognised their own donor sites, or recognised imprints or dressing remnants remaining on the DSW. The photographic assessment was taken as the definitive assessment in an effort to overcome bias.</p><p id="Par51">For longer-term outcome measures, such as scarring, full blinding was possible since assessors were blinded to the nature of the original DSW dressing.</p><p id="Par52">A number of secondary outcomes, such as itch, were partially blinded as above. Scar appearance assessors, other than patient and parent, were also blinded to the DSW dressing used. Scar assessment was performed by trained research staff, and not by surgeons or trial investigators.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par53">Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS for Mac version 23 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, New York, USA) and Stata version 15 (Statcorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA). Demographic data were analysed through descriptive statistics and between-groups analyses using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and/or non-parametric equivalents where appropriate. Generalised linear models, estimating variance appropriately for repeated measures where required, were used to determine whether there were differences between groups in primary and secondary outcomes. Changes in the intervention effects were examined with thickness of STSG, sex, and age of potential interest. Data were analysed on an intention-to-treat and on a per-protocol basis.

Our pain data capture for dressing change was not as complete as it was for early measurements. Re-epithelialisation assessment was potentially confounded by being only partially blinded to trial arm.</p><p id="Par95">Due to our dispersed patient population, not all patients were able to attend for their 3- or 6-month assessments, and so there are missing data in these groups. There are some data to suggest a thinner STSG leads to a better looking DSW at 3&#x000a0;months, across multiple modalities. This was not sustained at 6&#x000a0;months.</p><p id="Par96">We chose to measure a single biopsy from the centre of the STSG, in order to determine the thickness of the actual STSG (as opposed to the dialled thickness on the dermatome). It is possible this biopsy is not reflective of the totality of the STSG taken, or that thickness was altered during processing. However, this is the first study that does not assume all STSGs are uniform and instead to include a measured thickness as a co-variate in analyses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Generalisability</title><p id="Par97">Over the course of this trial, 131 patients were booked for STSG. In five cases, the procedure was cancelled at preoperative review. Our population is widely dispersed geographically, and our practice is to book these patients for review and STSG based on photographs or prior dressing change. This potentially saves a visit, but risks procedures being cancelled on the day. There were 10 ineligible patients. Of the 116 remaining patients, 6 were missed and 9 declined to participate. Thus, 101 of 116 potentially eligible patients (87%) took part in the trial. This trial therefore represents the majority of patients requiring grafting in our centre, limiting the potential for a biased selection of patients and increasing the generalisability of these results to our patient population.</p><p id="Par98">Pre-infiltration with local anaesthetic prior to STSG harvest is a common technique among surgeons, but we chose not to do so in our trial to further standardise our DSWs. We were concerned pre-infiltration might confound our STSG thickness measurements and so chose topical local anaesthetic instead.

It also demonstrates no superior dressing among the three used with respect to longer-term scarring up to 6&#x000a0;months. These results are consistent with our pre-trial subjective opinions. Time to re-epithelialisation, pain and itch scores, and scarring within the trial are consistent with assessments from out-of-trial patients in our database both before and after this RCT. There were no adverse effects observed with any of the dressings used, in particular, infection and its possible effect on delaying healing.</p><p id="Par101">Given these findings, and the fact that the unit cost of these dressings is minor when compared to the other costs of care for these patients, there is no economic argument to switch from one dressing to another. This is particularly so given the range of sizes available. As a result of the trial, surgeons in the unit utilise different DSW dressings depending on size of the DSW or its site.</p><p id="Par102">Regression analyses of our data demonstrate shorter DSW re-epithelialisation times in younger patients. This result is consistent with previous studies, dating back as far as the First World War [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Longer re-epithelialisation times in older patients may potentially unmask differences between the three dressings in use; differences that are not seen in more rapidly healing children.</p><p id="Par103">Regression analysis also demonstrated decreased pain in males at the first dressing change and decreased itch in younger patients at the first dressing change. This was not the case with subsequent dressing changes. These data should be interpreted with caution, as they are not consistently demonstrated across multiple dressing changes. The scales used often had parents standing in as proxies for their children. Validation data for younger children, and the use of parents as proxies, are lacking for these scales. It is possible that what is being measured here is an expectation effect, rather than a true difference.</p><p id="Par104">This is the first RCT in donor site dressings that has included the thickness of the harvested STSG as a co-variate. Contrary to opinion, DSWs are not uniform and their depth varies greatly.

This trial demonstrates no imperative to alter our current practices.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ANCOVA</term><def><p id="Par9">Analysis of co-variance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ANOVA</term><def><p id="Par10">Analysis of variance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CCBTR</term><def><p id="Par11">Centre for Children&#x02019;s Burns and Trauma Research</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CONSORT</term><def><p id="Par12">Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DACC</term><def><p id="Par13">Dialkylcarbamoylchloride</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DSW</term><def><p id="Par14">Donor site wound</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FLACC</term><def><p id="Par15">Face, legs, activity, cry, consolability pain scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FPS-R</term><def><p id="Par16">Revised Faces Pain Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HREC</term><def><p id="Par17">Human research ethics committee</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MCID</term><def><p id="Par18">Minimum clinically important difference</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NRS</term><def><p id="Par19">Numeric rating scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PLCBC</term><def><p id="Par20">Pegg Leditschke Children&#x02019;s Burns Centre</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>POSAS</term><def><p id="Par21">Patient and Observer Scare Assessment Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p id="Par22">Randomised controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p id="Par23">Standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>STSG</term><def><p id="Par24">Split-thickness skin graft</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Our thanks go to the staff of the PLCBC, who maintained the trial during the move from the Royal Children&#x02019;s Hospital to the Lady Cilento Children&#x02019;s Hospital.</p><p>We acknowledge and are grateful for the assistance of Dr. Asad Khan for his work with the complex statistical analyses.</p><p>A special thanks to Jackie Warren, Research Associate on this trial.</p><p>Thank you most of all to the children and parents who participated in this trial&#x02014;without you this would not have been possible.</p><p>We also acknowledge the Surgical Team: Infants, Toddlers, Children (STITCh); Children&#x02019;s Health Queensland; Level 7d Directorate; Lady Cilento Children&#x02019;s Hospital; 501 Stanley Street, South Brisbane; Queensland 4101; Australia.</p><sec id="FPar4"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par106">This trial was partially supported by a grant from Abigo Medical AB (Research Management number RM2013002823).</p><p id="Par107">The trial was funded in part by a grant from Abigo Medical AB.

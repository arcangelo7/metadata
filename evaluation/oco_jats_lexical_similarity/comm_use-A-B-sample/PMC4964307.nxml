In European hospitals, children are reported to account for almost half of all burns and scalds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Burn injury can lead to significant morbidity and mortality, including both physical and psychological sequelae, with a considerable associated health-economic impact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>There are a number of factors that have been demonstrated to directly influence the extent and pattern of burn injury sustained by the child, including the characteristics of the child (such as age and ethnicity), the heat source (iron, chemical agent or hot beverage), the injury mechanism (pull down or spill) and the environment in which the injury occurs (home or school, time of day the injury occurred and levels of social deprivation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>A recent study reported that the mechanisms, agents and patterns of burns are significantly different between children aged 5 or older and those aged less than 5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The rate of burns to the chest and face was significantly higher in the children aged less than 5&#x000a0;years, with older children sustaining a higher rate of outdoor injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The most common age for a child to suffer a burn injury is 1&#x000a0;year, with ten times as many burns and scalds as any school year age group. The most common causes of contact burns were reported to be irons, oven hobs and hair straighteners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Severity, pattern and distribution of childhood burns are influenced by the domestic environment. Contact burns from hobs, oven doors, irons and hair straighteners are increasingly reported in the paediatric population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Social deprivation has been demonstrated to be a risk factor for childhood accidents and deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The aim of this study was to report the incidence, mechanisms and environmental factors of all burns presentations to the ED in a regional burns centre over a 7-year period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Setting</title><p>A retrospective, single-centre study of all burns presentations to the ED of a regional burns centre in South Wales was conducted. Morriston Hospital in Swansea has over 90,000 presentations to the ED per year and serves a population of approximately 450,000. The Welsh Centre for Burns and Plastic Surgery is the regional adult burn centre for Wales and the South West of England, which serves a population of approximately ten million. Those patients coded as &#x02018;thermal injury&#x02019; were identified using the hospital database. This study only included patients presenting directly to the ED and not those transferred directly to the burns unit. All children recorded as having sustained a burn or scald, aged less than 16&#x000a0;years, with both accidental and non-accidental injuries were included in the analysis. Children were divided into school (5&#x02013;16&#x000a0;years) and non-school age (&#x0003c;5&#x000a0;years) for the analysis. Children suffering smoke inhalation only were excluded.</p><p>It was confirmed that ethical approval was not required for this study (Wales REC 6).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Data collection</title><p>The medical notes were reviewed following guidelines suggested in a study by Gilbert et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. These guidelines included the use of standardised data extraction forms, uniform handling of ambiguous data and regular meetings between the research team to ensure standardisation of data extraction. All patients aged 16&#x000a0;years and under presenting to the ED of Morriston Hospital in 2008 to 2014 were examined and data recorded on a pre-designed database. A validation check was completed in which an additional researcher checked the accuracy of data input for 10&#x000a0;% of all patients, in order to reduce information bias. If a patient&#x02019;s notes had missing or incomplete data for the variables under investigation, they were still included in the database.</p><p>The dataset included demographic variables such as age, sex, type of injury, percentage total burn surface area (TBSA) estimation, injury mechanism, injury agent, whether the injury was recorded as non-accidental, where the injury occurred (home or other) and primary anatomical area injured (according to the medical records). Outcomes recorded included mortality, hospital admission and hospital length of stay. Mechanism of injury for scald was further categorised into hot beverages (all hot drinks), domestic water (kettle, saucepan, bath, shower, tap, hot water bottle, flask, facial steamer and bowl of water) and food item (soup, cooking oil, pot noodle, gravy, curry and sauce) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Contact burn mechanisms were further categorised as portable household agents (iron, hair straighteners/tongs, light bulb, saucepan, oven tray, cigarette), fixed household items (oven, hob, grill, radiator, heated pipe, fireplace/wood burner and steam press), outdoor items (exhausts, firework, BBQ, bonfire, sand) and miscellaneous (not fitting other categories) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Chemical burns were further categorised as spills, ingestion, and eye splash. Radiation burns refer to thermal injury caused directly by the sun or sunbeds.</p><p>To ensure confidentiality, patients&#x02019; names were not recorded during the data collection period. The dataset was also stored on a hospital encrypted computer to ensure data security (safe-end protector encryption).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Version 21 (Chicago). Subjects&#x02019; demographics were analysed using descriptive statistics including numbers and percentages for categorical data and medians and interquartile ranges for continuous data (due to non-normal distribution). Comparisons were made between patients aged less than 5 and patients aged 5&#x02013;16 using chi-square test (categorical variables) and Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test (continuous variables). A two-sided probability value less than 0.05 was considered significant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Between 2008 and 2014, a total of 1459 children were identified on the hospital database.

The median age of the children in this study was 2&#x000a0;years, compared with a recent study in the UK that reported a mean age of 3.74 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. As in previous research, more male children presented to the ED with scalds and burn injuries than female [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Most scald and burn injuries occurred in the child&#x02019;s own home in this study, which concurs previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Child maltreatment was suspected in only 1&#x000a0;% of cases which is lower than previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, this result may be due to the inherent limitations in a retrospective study design. Deliberately self-inflicted burns were reported in 0.4&#x000a0;% of cases, all of which were older children using an aerosol spray, matches or lighter. A previous UK-based study discussed deliberate, self-inflicted burns and reported no such injuries in children under the age of 17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. One case of assault by a teenager on another (using a lighter) was reported, although previous research in children is limited to make any comparisons.</p><p>As reported in previous research, the peak prevalence for scalds, contact and electrical burns was 1&#x000a0;year of age and the most commonly injured site was a hand or digit in both age groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The results of this study concur with those of Kemp et al. highlighting that the most common injury mechanisms in children involved a spill of a hot beverage or touching a hot object such as an oven hob, iron or hair straighteners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In contrast to a number of previous studies; however [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], contact burns were the most common burn type in children aged less than 5, with fixed household items being the most common causative agent, such as oven doors or hobs, central-heating components and various types of fireplaces and wood burners.</p><p>Previous burn prevention strategies have previously targeted these contact burn agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]; however, portable devices such as hair straighteners also caused a large number of contact burns in children under the age of 5. Due to increasing popularity of hair straighteners over the last few years and the temperatures reached by these devices, it is imperative that innovations are needed to modify product design to reduce incidence of burns in children. A number of recent campaigns have been launched in the UK in an attempt to reduce contact burns caused by hair straighteners; however, the effectiveness of such campaigns is yet to be proven. Young children who have started to mobilise independently are commonly reported to suffer scalds due to knocking over hot beverages, and the results of this study supported this finding. As with contact burns, there has been a number of prevention strategies aimed at reducing scalds in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>A meta-analysis of prevention strategies suggested that although home safety education, especially with the provision of safety equipment, is effective in increasing some thermal injury prevention practices, there is insufficient evidence as to whether this also reduces injury rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. A more recent Cochrane review suggested that there is some evidence that burn intervention strategies may reduce injury rates, particularly where interventions are provided at home; however, further research is needed to confirm these findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>The results from this study and previous research confirm that most paediatric burns occur in 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;years and are caused by hot liquids and fixed or portable household devices, in the child&#x02019;s own home. Burns prevention strategies at a local level could include an educational video which is shown to parents prior to discharge home with a newborn baby. This is a strategy already used successfully in our health board for other education purposes. Devices such as lids for mugs and protective sleeves for hair straighteners could be made available to parents, especially considering the substantial costs that could be saved through the prevention of one severe burn alone.</p><p>The main limitation of this study was the use of the database to identify the patients for inclusion. It is possible that a number of patients were missed due to incorrect coding. The use of the database may have resulted in a degree of selection bias as errors may have occurred in the collation of the list of patients from the hospital database. A further limitation of the retrospective nature of the study is that not all of the medical notes could be successfully located; however, a rate of 1.6&#x000a0;% missing data was considered acceptable in a sample of this size. All data collected for each patient was retrieved from their ED medical notes; therefore, reliance was placed on the information being both accurately and legibly documented. Reliance on the ED notes for ascertaining non-accidental injury may also have led to a degree of inaccuracy, as this was recorded by the ED doctor based on suspicion alone and should be considered when interpreting the study results. Patients admitted directly to the burns unit would also have been missed leading to a degree of potential selection bias.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results of this 7-year retrospective study support previous findings that scalds and contact burns are the most common thermal injury in children aged less than 16.

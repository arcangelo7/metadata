patients with decompensated end-stage heart failure<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. Unfortunately, approximately 50% of the patients
with end-stage heart failure require additional cardiac surgical procedures. Rarely
have we presented a case of a patient whose Bentall procedure was combined with a
left VAD (LVAD) implantation during the same session.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>CASE REPORT</title><p>A 46-year-old male patient with dilated cardiomyopathy was admitted to our clinic
with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 3-4 functional capacity.</p><p>Physical examination revealed that the heart rate was 90 beats/min, blood pressure
was 105/65 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute. There was
crepitation on bilaterally basal segments of lungs and 3/6 diastolic murmur was
present in the aortic valve area with auscultation. There was no pathological
finding in other systems. Despite maximal medical treatment and intra-aortic balloon
pumping, hemodynamic deterioration developed in the second day of hospitalization.
Systolic blood pressure was 85 mmHg, signs of organ malperfusion with altered mental
status; cold, clammy skin; oliguria (30 ml/h); increased serum-lactate (8 mEq/L).
Echocardiography revealed that left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction was 20%, and
he presented with severe aortic insufficiency, moderate calcific aortic stenosis,
aortic annular dilatation and an ascending aortic aneurysm. His central venous
pressure (CVP) was 13 mmHg, alanine transaminase was 48 IU/l, aspartate transaminase
was 59 IU/l, international normalized ratio was 1.27, tricuspid annular plane
systolic excursion (TAPSE) was 14 mm, pulmonary vascular resistance was 2.4 Wood
Units, transpulmonary gradient (TPG) was 8 mmHg, and right ventricular stroke work
index (RVSWI) was 370 mmHg*ml/m<sup>2</sup>. Therefore, no pulmonary vasodilatatory
agent, including nitroprusside or milrinone, was required for the functional
reduction of the RV. The ascending, arcus, and descending aortic diameters were 55
mm, 35 mm, and 33 mm, respectively, in the computed tomographic imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>

X-Ray.</p><p>*Ascending aortic aneurysm, left ventricular assist device</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-34-02-0233-g01"/></fig>
</p><p>This patient was on the heart transplantation list, but due to the progression of his
clinical status and hemodynamic deterioration, our heart team decided to perform an
LVAD implantation and Bentall procedure.</p><sec><title>Surgical Procedure</title><p>After conducting a median sternotomy, the pericardium was opened and the aorta
was assessed. Sinus valsalva and proximal segment of ascending aorta were
aneurysmatic and the aortic tissue was very thin and fragile. There was normal
size aorta segment on the distal ascending aorta for cannulation and cross
clamping. Therefore, an aortic arterial cannulation was performed at the level
of brachiocephalic artery and a right atrial venous cannulation was also
performed. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was established in the standard fashion.
The patient's body was cooled to 28&#x000b0;C. After applying an ascending aortic cross
clamp, an aortotomy was performed on the aneurysmal ascending aorta, and cold
blood cardioplegia was delivered to the coronary arteries via the coronary
ostia. There was commissural fusion and diffuse calcification on the aortic
annulus, and the aortic valve exhibited a tricuspid structure. It was excised,
and the coronary ostia were prepared as buttons. The ascending aortic aneurysmal
tissue was also excised, and a distal aortic anastomosis area was prepared. A
conduit with a no. 28 Dacron tube graft and a no. 25 Carpentier-Edwards
Per&#x00131;mount pericardial aortic bioprosthesis valve was placed into the
aortic annulus with the aid of pledgets. Then, the coronary buttons were
anastomosed to the Dacron graft, and a distal aortic anastomosis was performed.
Thus, the Bentall procedure was completed.</p><p>Next, the cross-clamp was removed, and the body was warmed to 36&#x000b0;C. The LV
position was adjusted, and a suitable area on the LV was determined via
transesophageal echocardiography for the LVAD implantation. The ring of a
HeartMate 3 LVAD (Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL, USA) was implanted on the
apex of the heart enforced with Teflon felt under beating heart conditions. The
inflow cannula of the device was placed into the ventricular cavity, and the
battery cable of the device was removed from the right inferior quadrant of the
abdomen via the subxiphoid tunnel. All the air was evacuated from inside the
device and heart, and the outflow graft of the device was anastomosed to the
ascending aortic graft in an end-to-side fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). Then, the device was started. While the support of the
device increased, the support of the CPB was slowly decreased and ended. The
last control of the device was performed via transesophageal echocardiography.
The cardiac index was greater than 2.8 l/min/m<sup>2</sup> at a speed of 8,400
rpm. The RV function was satisfactory: TAPSE=16 mm, TPG=10 mmHg, and RVSWI=405
mmHg*ml/m<sup>2</sup>. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit
in a stable condition. The CPB time was 138 minutes, and the aortic cross clamp
time was 64 minutes.</p><p>
<fig id="f2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>A) Peroperative Picture, B) Operation Drawing.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-34-02-0233-g02"/></fig>
</p><p>The mean arterial pressure, CVP, cardiac rhythm, and pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure were 75 mmHg, 14 mmHg, 83 beats/minute, and 10 mmHg, respectively.
Therefore, the hemodynamic parameters were normal. The patient awoke 6 hours
after the surgery, and his neurological status was entirely normal. The total
drainage was 1,250 cc during the first day and 650 cc during the second day
postoperatively. Three units of erythrocyte suspension were used in total. The
extubation was performed at the postoperative 21st hour. RV failure findings
were not observed, and the early postoperative period was satisfactory. This
patient was discharged on postoperative day 32. The control examination was
satisfactory in terms of the clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic
measurements during second month after the surgery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). He is still on the heart transplantation
list.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>D&#x00130;SCUSS&#x00130;ON</title><p>In this case, we performed Bentall procedure combined with a LVAD implantation
urgently. The patient was in the heart transplantation list. Hemodynamic and
clinical deterioration occurred and maximal medical treatment and intra-aortic
balloon pump were performed. But hemodynamic and clinical situation were not
satisfactory. Ideal intervention was heart transplantation and ascending aorta
replacement. But we did not have a chance to find an emergency donor for this
patient with acute decompansated heart failure. Therefore, our hear team decided to
perform an LVAD implantation and a Bentall procedure in the same session to bridge
for transplantation.</p><p>When compared with other cardiac operations, patients with LVADs have a 6%-8%
increased risk of requiring additional surgery within one year of the
implantation<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Our
patient with end-stage decompensated heart failure suffered from severe aortic
insufficiency, aortic root and sinus valsalva dilatation and an ascending aortic
aneurysm. Therefore, we performed the Bentall procedure combined with an LVAD
implantation in the same session. Takeda et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> reported a case with multiple saccular ascending aortic
aneurysms and end-stage heart failure, and they also successfully performed an
aortic surgery combined with an LVAD implantation. Moreover, the effects of a
continuous-flow LVAD on aortic wall stress were studied by Segura et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. They evaluated the ascending
aortic tissue before and after the implantation of an LVAD by comparing the medial
degeneration, elastic fiber fragmentation, medial fibrosis, and atherosclerosis.
They observed that the LVAD had a significant effect on the ascending aorta. Thus,
surgical interventions for ascending aortic aneurysms seem unavoidable in these
patients. Therefore, our cardiac team decided to conduct the Bentall procedure
combined with an LVAD implantation in our patient.</p><p>Patients with ascending aortic aneurysms have further risks during LVAD implantation
procedures. For example, a rupture may occur during the outflow graft anastomosis
due to the fragile and weak ascending aortic tissue. Therefore, changing the
aneurysmal ascending aorta is necessary before the LVAD implantation, even though
this increases the surgical risk. The other choices for improving aortic valve
insufficiency at the time of an LVAD implantation are an aortic valve repair or
closure. Although there is no clear superiority between these methods in the
literature, Robertson et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>
determined that an aortic valve closure significantly increases mortality.
Therefore, we chose the aortic valve replacement method to avoid the increased risk
of mortality in our case.</p><p>In summary, a rare operation that combined the Bentall procedure with an LVAD
implantation was performed successfully, and the patient is now waiting for a heart
transplantation in a more comfortable state.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="5%" span="1"/><col width="95%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SG</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Substantial contributions to the

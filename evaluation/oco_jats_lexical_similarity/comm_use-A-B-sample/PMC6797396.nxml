Compared with the group initially treated with azithromycin, the lung function of patients on placebo stabilises after starting azithromycin. Progression-free survival and overall survival were not different between the groups. In addition, in this group, BOS severity and the time to development of BOS did not affect survival. This analysis shows that conducting randomised placebo-controlled trials is safe in terms of progression of BOS and long-term survival.</p><p>A recent meta-analysis by Kingah <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> demonstrated that there is an improvement of lung function in patients with BOS after 7 months. The majority of studies included were retrospective. The only randomised placebo-controlled trial from our centre showed an improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub> with azithromycin.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The natural course of BOS in lung transplantation has been reported by Lama <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In this observational study, there was a steep decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> in the first 6 months. The data in our study showed that in the treatment group, lung function stabilises, and in the placebo group, after an initial decline, lung function improves after 3 months of open-label treatment with azithromycin to a level similar to the treatment group. Although the lung function decline is progressive over time in our study group, this is a gradual process. In the study by Lama <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> average lung function decrease was approximately 16% in the first year after onset of BOS; however, BOS was less severe in our study group. Compared with the Lama <italic>et al</italic> data, there was no progressive decline in lung function with azithromycin in our study group in the first year after BOS onset, and in agreement with the observational study by Shitrit <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> azithromycin slowed down progression of BOS within the first year of BOS onset. After 5 years, there was a further decline of FEV<sub>1</sub>; however, an approximately 0.30&#x02009;mL (10%) decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> in 4 years with azithromycin seems a clinical significant finding and supports the positive impact of azithromycin.</p><p>Progression of BOS, arbitrarily defined as &#x0003e;10% decline of FEV<sub>1</sub> or referral for TLI, was not different between the groups. This might suggest that performing a randomised placebo-controlled trial is safe in terms of progression of BOS. In addition, long-term survival was not different between the groups. Our study showed a better 5-year survival when compared with the overall survival in the study by Finlen Copeland <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> More intensive immunosuppression after the onset of BOS may have resulted in higher risk of infections and death consequently. However, in the Copeland study, there was no relation between intensive immunosuppression and survival. In addition, in our study population, more intensive immunosuppression was not a common practice. Time to BOS onset and BOS severity affected survival in the Copeland study but were not significant in our study. The median onset time was shorter in our study and may have resulted in earlier participation to the randomised placebo-controlled trial and thus intervention with azithromycin. This is supported by the Vos <italic>et al</italic> study, where earlier initiation of azithromycin was protective of BOS progression and death.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Forty per&#x02009;cent of our study population had higher grades of BOS (&#x0003e;1) compared with the Copeland study. During the clinical trial period, but also on regular clinical visits, patients with higher grades of BOS are followed up more closely, and there is a low threshold to treat acute rejection and infections. Our long-term follow-up data corroborate with the study findings of Ruttens <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In their study, prophylactic azithromycin had a sustained benefit post-transplantation on prolonging BOS-free survival and preserving graft function.</p><p>Limitations of this report include the retrospective design, being a single-centre study and the size of the study population. However, the study population reflects an average patient population in a lung transplant centre, and we believe the conclusions are both valid and important.</p><p>In conclusion, long-term treatment with azithromycin initially improves lung function then slows down the progression of BOS, although the effect of TLI may have affected the observed attenuation of FEV<sub>1</sub> decline. Importantly, BOS progression and long-term survival are not affected by randomisation to placebo for a 3-month period, given the early cross-over to azithromycin and possibly due to TLI in case of further progression. Survival was not different between early or late onset of BOS and was better than many previously reported series.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref>

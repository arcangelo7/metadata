Although the growth plates of MEPE-overexpressing mice display severe morphological disruption, the expression and function of MEPE in growth plate matrix mineralization remains largely undefined. Here we show MEPE and its cleavage product, the acidic serine aspartate-rich MEPE-associated motif (ASARM) peptide, to be localised to the hypertrophic zone of the growth plate. We also demonstrate that the phosphorylated (p)ASARM peptide inhibits ATDC5 chondrocyte matrix mineralization. Stable MEPE-overexpressing ATDC5 cells also had significantly reduced matrix mineralization in comparison to the control cells. Interestingly, we show that the addition of the non-phosphorylated (np)ASARM peptide promoted mineralization in the ATDC5 cells. The peptides and the overexpression of MEPE did not affect the differentiation of the ATDC5 cells. For a more physiologically relevant model, we utilized the metatarsal organ culture model. We show the pASARM peptide to inhibit mineralization at two stages of development, as shown by histological and &#x003bc;CT analysis. Like in the ATDC5 cells, the peptides did not affect the differentiation of the metatarsals indicating that the effects seen on mineralization are direct, as is additionally confirmed by no change in alkaline phosphatase activity or mRNA expression. In the metatarsal organ cultures, the pASARM peptide also reduced endothelial cell markers and vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA expression. Taken together these results show MEPE to be an important regulator of growth plate chondrocyte matrix mineralization through its cleavage to an ASARM peptide.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><title>Highlights</title><p>&#x025ba; MEPE and its ASARM peptide are localised to the hypertrophic chondrocytes of the growth plate. &#x025ba; Phosphorylated ASARM peptides inhibit chondrocyte matrix mineralisation in ATDC5 cells and in metatarsal organ cultures. &#x025ba; This inhibition is independent of altered alkaline phosphatase activity. &#x025ba; Phosphorylated ASARM peptides inhibited the mRNA expression of endothelial cell specific markers and pro-angiogenic VEGF.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>MEPE</kwd><kwd>ASARM</kwd><kwd>Growth plate</kwd><kwd>Mineralization</kwd><kwd>Chondrocyte</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><p>Edited by: J.

This growth process is orchestrated by various actions at the growth plate, a developmental region consisting of chondrocytes in distinct cellular zones. The proliferation, hypertrophy and apoptosis of these growth plate chondrocytes are regulated by a tight array of factors ensuring effective cartilage mineralization and thus longitudinal growth <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>Hydroxyapatite (HA) crystals form associated with the trilaminar membrane bound matrix vesicles (MV) which in the growth plate are localised to the mineralized longitudinal septae and form from the plasma membrane of the terminal hypertrophic chondrocytes <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Mineralization is a biphasic process which is under tight control so as to ensure levels of calcium (Ca<sup>2&#x000a0;+</sup>) and inorganic phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>) are permissive for effective HA formation <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Three molecules have been identified as imperative in controlling levels of the mineralization inhibitors inorganic pyrophosphate (PP<sub>i</sub>), and osteopontin <xref rid="bb0010 bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[2,3]</xref>. These are alkaline phosphatase (ALP), a nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase isozyme (NPP1), and the Ankylosis protein (ANK). However, mechanisms beyond the supply and hydrolysis of PP<sub>i</sub> likely exist to control chondrocyte matrix mineralization.</p><p>Once such mechanism could involve matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein (MEPE, OF45). This was originally isolated and cloned from tumors of oncogenic hypophosphatemic osteomalacia (OHO) as a candidate substrate for phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidases on the X chromosome (PHEX) <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. MEPE is a 56&#x02013;58&#x000a0;kDa SIBLING (small integrin-binding ligand N-linked glycosylated) protein along with dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1), osteopontin (OPN), dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) and bone sialoprotein (BSP) <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. SIBLING proteins are expressed in bone and dentin, and have roles in extracellular matrix (ECM) formation and mineralization <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Their structures are similar; all display an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif which facilitates cell attachment, and all are commonly located on the human chromosome 4q21-23 <xref rid="bb0020 bb0035 bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[4,7,8]</xref>.</p><p>In bone, MEPE is primarily expressed by osteocytes, but <italic>Mepe</italic> mRNA expression has also been observed in osteoblasts <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The expression of MEPE is increased during osteoblast matrix mineralization suggesting a function for MEPE in bone mineralization <xref rid="bb0050 bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[10,11]</xref>. This has been further fuelled by analysis of the MEPE null mouse in which the ablation of MEPE leads to an increased bone mass due to increased numbers and activity of osteoblasts <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Furthermore, the overexpression of MEPE in mice, under the control of the Col1a1 promoter, leads to defective mineralization coupled with an increased level of MEPE-ASARM peptides in bone <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The MEPE-overexpressing mice displayed wider epiphyseal growth plates, with associated expanded primary spongiosa and a significant decrease in mineral apposition rate <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Further studies in vitro have confirmed the inhibitory effect of MEPE on mineralization and have identified that MEPE is cleaved to a 2.2&#x000a0;kDa ASARM peptide which causes this effect <xref rid="bb0070 bb0075" ref-type="bibr">[14,15]</xref>. The ASARM motif is located immediately downstream of a cathepsin B cleavage site, and it is responsible for the mineralization defect observed in X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets, the most common form of inherited rickets <xref rid="bb0020 bb0070 bb0075" ref-type="bibr">[4,14,15]</xref>. This defect can be reversed by administration of cathepsin inhibitors CAO74 or pepstatin <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. PHEX plays a central role in the protection of MEPE from proteolytic cleavage by cathepsin B; it can bind to MEPE and prevent the release of the ASARM peptide <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The <italic>Hyp</italic> mouse, a spontaneous <italic>Phex</italic> knockout model, has an increased expression of cathepsin D, an upstream activator of cathepsin B <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Therefore PHEX may also assist in decreasing the activation of cathepsin B.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that the post translational modification of the MEPE-ASARM peptide is key to its functional role. MEPE has a number of potential casein kinase II phosphorylation motifs, and it is here that the ASARM peptide is phosphorylated at 3 serine residues <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. This has been shown to inhibit mineralization in murine calvarial osteoblasts and in bone marrow stromal cells by the direct binding of the MEPE-ASARM peptide to HA crystals <xref rid="bb0070 bb0090" ref-type="bibr">[14,18]</xref>.</p><p>To elucidate the interactions of MEPE in the growth plate, this study was undertaken to examine the presence and function of MEPE and its ASARM peptide in growth plate matrix mineralization during the endochondral ossification process. The data indicated that MEPE is expressed by growth plate chondrocytes, in particular in the hypertrophic zone of chondrocytes consistent with a potential role in matrix mineralization. MEPE has a functional role in the inhibition of chondrocyte ECM mineralization, involving its cleavage, and subsequent phosphorylation, to the ASARM peptide.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s0010"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0015"><title>Animals</title><p>Proximal tibiae from 3&#x02010; and 4&#x02010;week&#x02010;old C57/BL6 mice were dissected and excess tissue was removed before preparation of the tissues for in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry and microdissection of the growth plate.

The localization of cathepsin B at the chondro-osseous junction is in concordance with previous studies detailing the cathepsin B rich septoclast <xref rid="bb0160 bb0165" ref-type="bibr">[32,33]</xref>. These cells, thought to be of macrophage or osteoclast origin, are postulated to play a key role in the degradation of unmineralized cartilage <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.

It is well recognised that the post translational phosphorylation of the MEPE-ASARM peptide is essential for its inhibitory role. Here we utilized the metatarsal organ culture model, a well&#x02010;established model of cartilage mineralization and endochondral bone growth. Developmentally in mice by E15, the point at which we use metatarsal bones in these studies, despite a considerable degree of periosteal ossification occurring in the long bones, the metatarsal bones exist as a cartilage model. Here our results unequivocally show that the phosphorylated ASARM peptide (pASARM) has a significant inhibitory role on chondrocyte matrix mineralization. Here we report no difference in the widths of the cartilage zones in the metatarsal bones. A widening of the hypertrophic zone would be expected as seen in hypophosphatemic rickets, and as is observed in the MEPE-overexpressing mouse <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. This is not surprising though as there was also no difference in the growth potential, chondrocyte proliferation or mRNA expression of chondrocyte differentiation markers, of the treated and untreated bones.

In the MEPE-overexpressing mouse, however, an increase in <italic>Phex</italic> mRNA is observed and this, coupled with the expected hydrolysis of the ASARM peptide, leads to altered MEPE processing and therefore the hyperphosphatemia observed in this mouse model <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. These data are also in agreement with previous reports showing increased MEPE expression by osteoblasts of HYP mice and this positive regulation of MEPE expression by pASARM may exacerbate the condition&#x000a0;<xref rid="bb0020 bb0050 bb0075 bb0330" ref-type="bibr">[4,10,15,66]</xref>. It is reasonable to speculate that physiologically there must be a regulatory mechanism to ensure that there is not an overproduction of ASARM peptides and as such a pathological state. The precise nature of the counter balancing mechanism is presently unknown but as the SIBLING proteins are closely related and it is possible that one of the other members of this family may be responsible.</p><p>Key to endochondral ossification is the vascularization of the mineralized matrix <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) proteolytically degrade the mineralized cartilage matrix, facilitating blood vessel penetration into the growth plate and allowing the recruitment of osteoclast precursors and osteoblast progenitors. Pro-angiogenic VEGF is produced by hypertrophic chondrocytes of the growth plate and VEGF<sub>164/188</sub> deletion from the cartilage of developing mice results in delayed recruitment of blood vessels to the perichondrium along with a delayed invasion of vessels into the primary ossification centre <xref rid="bb0335" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. Here we have shown that the pASARM peptide reduces the levels of endothelial cells present during metatarsal organ culture due to the vessel invasion of the bones at approximately E14&#x02013; E15. This was associated with reduced VEGF<sub>120/164</sub> mRNA expression levels. It is entirely possible that the influence of the pASARM peptide on endothelial cell populations is indirect, by impacting hypertrophic chondrocyte VEGF expression. However, any direct effects of the pASARM peptide on endothelial cell function remain uninvestigated. The possible implications of MEPE on bone renal vascularization have recently been described in the MEPE-overexpressing mouse, which in contrast to our studies exhibits defective mineralization associated with increased blood vessels <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Similarly, we also found a decrease in <italic>Mmp13</italic> mRNA expression following pASARM treatment which has been implicated in angiogenesis despite there being a lack of impairment of vascularization in the <italic>Mmp13</italic> knockout mouse <xref rid="bb0200 bb0205 bb0340" ref-type="bibr">[40,41,68]</xref>. It is likely that in the <italic>Mmp13</italic> knockout and the <italic>Mepe-</italic>overexpressing mice, unknown compensatory mechanisms could exist to allow for effective vascularization of the skeleton. Like MEPE, DMP1, another SIBLING protein, has also been suggested as an inhibitor of VEGF receptor 2 mediated angiogenesis although the precise role of its ASARM peptide in this circumstance has yet to be elucidated <xref rid="bb0345" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>.</p><p>To conclude, our studies detail for the first time the functional role that MEPE and its ASARM peptide have in chondrocyte matrix mineralization. We have shown MEPE to be expressed by growth plate chondrocytes, in particular in the hypertrophic zone of chondrocytes consistent with a role in matrix mineralization. We have shown this role to be dependent upon the extent of the cleavage and subsequent phosphorylation of MEPE, and that mechanisms may exist which positively regulate the further expression of MEPE. Our studies complement previous findings of MEPE and its role in biomineralization; however, much remains to be learnt regarding the in vivo role of MEPE and the ASARM peptide in bone disease.</p><p>The following are the supplementary data related to this article.<fig id="f0040"><label>Supplemental Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Analysis of mRNA expression in MEPE-overexpressing and empty vector control clones after 15&#x000a0;days of culture.

Expression was present in both the proliferating zone (PZ) and the hypertrophic zone (HZ) of the growth plate, as indicated by the arrows (B), with an apparent increase in expression in the hypertrophic zone of chondrocytes (C). Microdissection of the growth plate was adopted to assess <italic>Mepe</italic> mRNA expression. The accuracy of the microdissection technique was determined by the relative change in <italic>col10a1</italic> mRNA expression throughout the zones of the growth plate and the trabecular bone (D). This was then used to examine the relative change in <italic>Mepe</italic> mRNA expression in these zones (E). Immunohistochemistry shows MEPE (F and G) and the MEPE-ASARM peptide (I and J) to be expressed in the tibia of 4-week-old growth plates. Its expression in the growth plate is limited to the hypertrophic zone (HZ) of chondrocytes, as indicated by the arrows. Cathepsin B immunolocalization (L and M) was exclusive to the chondro-osseous junction, as highlighted by the arrows. Representative images of appropriate negative control are shown (H, K, and N).

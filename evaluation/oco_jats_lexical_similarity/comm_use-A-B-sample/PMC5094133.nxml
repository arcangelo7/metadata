There were 1178 (42.7&#x000a0;%) respondents who had previously received burn first aid information. One thousand five hundred fifty respondents had a history of burn exposure in which burn injury first aid was applied as follows: 1118 (72.1&#x000a0;%) removed clothing and accessories from the injured area; water was applied by 990 (63.9&#x000a0;%); among those who applied water, 877 (88.6&#x000a0;%) applied cold water; and only 57 (5.8&#x000a0;%) did so for more than 15&#x000a0;min. Wrapping the burn area was performed by 526 (33.9&#x000a0;%), and 985 (63.5&#x000a0;%) sought medical assistance. When it comes to traditional remedies, 2134 (77.4&#x000a0;%) knew of and/or implemented these remedies as first aid or to treat burns. Honey and toothpaste were the commonest among these remedies with 1491 (69.9&#x000a0;%) and 1147 (53.7&#x000a0;%), respectively.

Proper knowledge about burn first aid minimizes the overall impact of the injury. This study was conducted in an effort to assess the level of awareness of the Saudi population regarding burn first aid, with the aim to recognize the weaknesses in this topic to facilitate addressing these areas in the future. Worldwide, 195,000 deaths occur annually from burns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. A meta-analysis done by Othman et al. demonstrated that the incidence of burns in the East Mediterranean region ranges from 112 to 518 per 100,000 per year; mortality was reported to be from 0.2 to 5.6 per 100,000 per year, with homes being the commonest location of burn injury ranging from 72 to 94&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The modern-day household is the most common location where burns occur; inhabitants who smoke cigarettes, the presence of electrical appliances, cooking, water heaters, and the presence of chemical products make this the case. This is evident when examining the location of domestic burns where the kitchen and bathrooms were the most common sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Several studies have been published reporting the epidemiology of burns in Saudi Arabia with common findings. Scald and flame burns predominated, and homes were the commonest location with children being the most common age group afflicted, most of which were under 5&#x000a0;years. Most of these studies also showed that burns were more common in males. Additionally, mortality was generally low ranging from 4.4 to 9.4&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. These findings are consistent with the international data from other countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>The cost of treating burns represents a major burden on governments and healthcare systems. In 2000, the direct cost for care of children with burns in the USA exceeded 211 million dollars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In Germany, a total of 270,000 Euros per patient per year are spent on burn victims [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and in the UK, it was about &#x000a3;63,157 Pounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Preventive measures and burn first aid have been proven to reduce morbidity and mortality from burns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Studies have shown that certain first aid measures have a beneficial impact on reducing morbidity-related healthcare costs, through limiting tissue damage, leading to a decrease in the need for surgical intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>With regard to first aid, stopping the burn process, the immediate application of running cold tap water for a time period of 20&#x000a0;min, removing clothing and jewelry, and covering the wound with a sterile dressing would all positively affect the outcome of burns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Cold water that has been shown to improve outcome in terms of healing and final cosmetic result should be from 2&#x02013;15&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and applied immediately for the same time frame [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. If the application of water is slightly delayed or if it is applied for less than 20&#x000a0;min, there will still be some beneficial effect based on animal histological section studies but the analgesic advantage of immediate application would be lost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Furthermore, the beneficial effects of cooling the burn wound should not deteriorate the general condition of the patient (like hypothermia in children) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Improper practices of burn first aid can have detrimental consequences. Ice is a common measure used by victims and first responders; ice increases the risk of hypothermia especially in larger surface area burns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. A common misconception in many areas is the use of eggs, toothpaste, mud, and other traditional remedies that are harmful, certainly aggravating the injury and creating a more favorable environment for infection, and at best, these remedies are of no benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>Saudi Arabia and other Muslim communities represent a unique setting where burns of specific social nature arise, for example, the weekly Friday mass prayer and the annual pilgrimage in Mecca are regarded as high-risk gatherings for burns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The holy month of Ramadan in which Muslims fast from dawn to sunset has potentiated burns in epileptic patients not taking their medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Other specific events include the Muslim Eid Alfitr/Aladha where fireworks are used for celebration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In this article, we aimed to assess the general knowledge and practices related to burn first aid implementation together with tendency towards the use of traditional remedies to manage these injuries or to treat them.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>An Internet-based cross-sectional study with a survey was designed using a 30-part questionnaire submitted over a 4-week period through different social media platforms to assess the knowledge and practices of the Saudi general population with regard to first aid in burn injuries and traditional remedies. The questionnaire included information on socio-economic and demographic variables and retrospective questions on what first aid measures respondents&#x02019; use. Participation in the survey was ensured to be anonymous.</p><p>The web-based questionnaire was developed and designed using Survey Monkey (SurveyMonkey.com) as the platform. The survey was made in Arabic language to make it easier for the public to read and understand. Then, the results were translated to English using proper accredited translation tools. Survey Monkey is a web-based, flexible, scalable, and secure survey development tool. It was piloted on 15 participants with the clarity of questions, time consumed, and flow of contents utilizing both an electronic actual version and a printed version on different applicant with various demographics including age, sex, education level, and social class. A panel of expert plastic surgeons to ensure proper content reviewed the survey. The questionnaire responses were anonymous. Reviewing the IP address of respondents was performed to prevent duplication.</p><p>Data was encoded into Microsoft Excel worksheets and imported to Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS<bold>&#x000ae;</bold>) software for analysis. Descriptive data was expressed as percentages. Correlations between variables were performed using Pearson Correlation coefficient. Significance of correlations was tested using chi-square test for categorical variables. <italic>P</italic> values &#x0003c;0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Results</title><p>At the end of the assessment period, a total of 2758 individuals responded to the survey.

In Kwa-Zulu Natal, 26&#x000a0;% applied water and only 1&#x000a0;% applied water for 10&#x000a0;min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In our Saudi population sample, water was applied initially by 63.9&#x000a0;% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;990) of respondents, of which cold water was used by 88.5&#x000a0;%. Most respondents 59.3&#x000a0;% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;588) applied water for less than 5&#x000a0;min (detailed in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). As shown, Saudi Arabia stands poorly when it comes to proper burn first aid, with the local figures being close to those in Turkey and Kwa-Zulu Natal and far from those in western countries. One important note is that in all countries, the vast majority of the population did not uphold the proper implementation, so that even if water was applied, it was for much less than the optimal duration, thereby limiting the benefit of the recommended measure.<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Burn first aid practices summarized literature</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Author</th><th>Location</th><th>Burn first aid practices</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Harvey et al.

</p><p>Education and literacy level represents an important factor for proper adoption of first aid practice. The reported literacy rate among Saudi population aged 15 and above was 94.4&#x000a0;% (female 91.4&#x000a0;%, male 96.5&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The majority of our respondents were university graduates, of which 51.1&#x000a0;% were holding a bachelor degree (detailed in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p><p>The previous acquisition of knowledge regarding burn first aid was found in 43.6&#x000a0;%, which meant that less than half of respondents had received such information, translating to a poor penetration of awareness campaigns in the community. An upside to this is that the top two sources for the information with a combined percentage of 88.1&#x000a0;% were from an official course or a pamphlet, which usually are revised and correct methods of dissemination.</p><p>Knowledge about traditional home remedies applied to burn wounds was high among our screened subjects, in which 77.4&#x000a0;% of respondents knew of and potentially would use them for burn first aid. This figure is substantially higher compared to other populations, which might reflect a rigid trust of their efficacy as what was noticed in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Suleiman AK conducted a cross-sectional study among Saudi population to evaluate the level of awareness and safety of different herbal remedies and showed that 91.1&#x000a0;% of respondents did not ask for an expert (pharmacist, physician) opinion prior to such use while 66.2&#x000a0;% relied on friends&#x02019; or relatives&#x02019; recommendation. Furthermore, 81.2&#x000a0;% of respondents believed that the use of herbal remedies is harmless [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p>Various international reports have shown, for example, in Ghana, mud, burned snail shell, Gentian Violet paint, and eggs were applied to 75&#x000a0;% of the screened pediatric patients with burn wounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]; in Kwa-Zulu Natal, 59.2&#x000a0;% used substances like eggs, butter, and soap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]; in Milas, Turkey, 51&#x000a0;% applied similar traditional remedies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], whereas in Brisbane, Australia, only 14 out of 459 subjects (3.1&#x000a0;%) applied such remedies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In Bangladesh, other traditional remedies were reported that ranged from raw eggs, banana trees, mud, toothpaste, onion, raw potato mash to coconut oil, kerosene oil, sesame oil, and juice of &#x0201c;kapila&#x0201d; leaves used mostly in rural population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>The use of different remedies might reside in the fact that such wounds are painful if exposed and with the improper knowledge about correct and clear first aid measures such application provides a temporary relief [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>Specific herbs create quite a controversy; aloe vera, tea-tree oil, and lavender oil have anti-bacterial and anesthetic effects, but their effect, as first aid measures that improve outcome, have shown conflicting data, with a general impression from various studies is that they do no harm but are of no benefit either [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. For other remedies, deleterious effects might occur. For example, an incident of an anaphylactic reaction after the application of eggs to a burn wound was reported in the USA in an immigrant African family that was luckily treated successfully [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p>Toothpaste as an option to manage burns was chosen by 53.7&#x000a0;% of respondents (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1147). This was also noticed in other countries like Turkey (1.9&#x000a0;%), UK (4&#x000a0;%), and Australia with documented harmful effects with possibility to exacerbate the initial injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p>Pure honey on the other hand might represent an interesting modality, as honey is believed to have abilities to stimulate tissue growth, enhance epithelialization, and minimize scar formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p>Our results showed that 69.9&#x000a0;% of the respondents knew of and potentially applied honey as a first aid measurement to their burns. Such practice was also reported with different extent across the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Honey was compared to different clinical modalities like the use of mafenide acetate or silver sulfadiazene. Interestingly enough, the application of honey over burn wounds was shown to have reduced the inflammatory reaction, enhanced wound healing, and better control of infections, and to less likely cause contracture or hypertrophic scars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. On the other hand, recent results of a systematic review evaluating the use of honey in comparison with other conventional dressing protocols found serious doubts and may in fact delay the healing potential of partial and full thickness burns compared to early excision and grafting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p><p>Overall, when it comes to burn first aid, the use of the scientifically studied and recommended treatments is much more simple, available, inexpensive, and has no potential for harm if applied appropriately. Different cultural remedies that are of no clinical benefits together with potential delay in the wound management by masking the extent of burn injury all should be avoided.</p><p>Local current statistics showed 21.6 million registered Saudi Internet users with a net population penetration of 68.5&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Putting this in mind, we have utilized this mean of communication to conduct our survey. Despite this, several confounding variables might affect the captured population surveyed with their variability and the potential selection bias to certain questions, all of which might act as a potential limitation to this study.</p><p>This however might help in assessing the general population level of knowledge about a particular topic in a relatively easy and low cost technique. Also, it might open an era of further focused investigative work related to this field.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, such results represent the fact that burn first aid practices in Saudi Arabia is poor knowing the fact that the majority of the screened respondents were university graduates (51.1&#x000a0;%), with most victims being mismanaged and potentially worsening the injury. The traditional home remedy practice was also high, which further worsens the current status. The results of this study should be taken into serious consideration by the different healthcare agencies responsible to shed light on deficiencies and to start widespread community incentives. The use of the different means of education about the essential practices of burn first aid management can be further implemented in school and university subjects. Implementation of different community health campaigns should target different audiences at various locations like shopping malls and general public gatherings addressing and demonstrating the proper practices related to burn injuries. The need to control and mass educate the population about the harms associated with the improper application of various traditional remedies without seeking medical attention needs to be implemented in an effort to decrease the morbidity and mortality from this grave injury.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The study was supported by the College of Medicine Research Center, Deanship of Scientific Research, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

During the pilot study, the authors encountered numerous other contingency plans that did not meet their definition of safety-netting advice and listed these under the exclusion criteria with examples for coders (<xref rid="table3" ref-type="table">Box 1</xref>).

A literature review was conducted by the first author, along with a search of clinical guidelines and all articles citing the seminal work by Almond and colleagues.<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The authors also drew on existing codes for safety-netting communication behaviours developed in the &#x02018;Understanding the causes of miscommunication in primary care consultations for children with acute cough&#x02019; (UnPAC) study of paediatric primary care consultations.<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Development work using 93 consultations from the archive obtained by a random sample stratified by GP was conducted to further develop and test the codebook. Consultations containing safety-netting advice were independently assessed by two coders, new codes were generated, and existing codes refined. An iterative approach of coding, discussion, and refinement of the codebook with further examples added to illustrate each code was used.</p><p>Five members of the public were recruited to advise on further refinements that would be important to include from a patient&#x02019;s perspective. Participants were recruited from a list of people who had agreed to be contacted and were reimbursed for their travel and time. Once both coders were satisfied with the contents of the codebook, formal assessment of inter-rater reliability (IRR) of the safety-netting codes was initiated.</p></sec><sec><title>Presence or absence of safety-netting advice</title><p>Two coders independently reviewed a random sample of 10% (32/318) of the consultations for the presence or absence of safety-netting advice using both transcripts and consultation recordings. Each coder recorded whether they thought safety-netting advice had been provided for each problem raised in the consultation, recorded the line number where the safety-netting advice started, and highlighted the relevant part of the transcript. Where there was disagreement between coders, a third member of the research team was consulted until a group consensus was met. One coder, the first author, then screened the rest of the database.</p></sec><sec><title>Application of coding tool to a sample of consultations</title><p>All consultations or problems identified as including safety-netting advice from this stage of the process were then deemed eligible for coding. An a priori overall target of 85% inter-rater agreement was set. Again, both transcripts and consultation recordings were used together to facilitate accurate coding.

And does the patient ask any questions about the advice? The group also helped with the refinement of one existing code: action advised as part of the safety netting advice to include an option to seek help from another in-hours provider such as a pharmacist.</p></sec><sec><title>Collapsed codes and repeat evaluation</title><p>Inter-rater testing demonstrated that some variables were too difficult for coders to reliably distinguish between. For example, when assessing how patients responded, coders found it difficult to differentiate between codes for acknowledgements <italic>&#x02018;yeah&#x02019;</italic>, positive assessments <italic>&#x02018;great, fine &#x02019;</italic>, and acceptance <italic>&#x02018;OK, all right, sure &#x02019;</italic>. These codes were subsequently collapsed into a single &#x02018;acknowledgement or acceptance&#x02019; code. Two codes (the action advised and the timescale of action) that were deemed to have performed substandardly but were judged to be essential to retain underwent further refinement and were evaluated in 10 further randomly selected consultations that contained safety-netting advice (13 problems, 25 discrete episodes of safety-netting advice) using the relevant parts of the written transcripts only. The authors also wanted to differentiate whether coders thought the safety-netting advice and follow-up plans had been fully or only partially documented in the patient&#x02019;s medical notes and if diagnostic uncertainty and the expected time courses of illness were delivered with the safety-netting advice or at a separate part of the consultation, but IRR scores demonstrated that in its current format coders could not reliably discriminate to this level of detail.</p></sec><sec><title>Adjustments and dropped codes</title><p>Three codes were removed from the tool as the coders struggled to reliably differentiate between the different variables. A list of all the dropped codes and their IRR scores are shown in Supplementary Table 2. Two contextual codes, which both had substantial IRR score &#x02014; &#x02018;is this the first presentation with this problem to healthcare professional?&#x02019; (agreement 89%, <italic>&#x003ba;</italic> = 0.71) and &#x02018;is a diagnosis given&#x02019; (agreement 74%, <italic>&#x003ba;</italic> = 0.62) &#x02014; were deemed non-essential to the coding tool on final review and therefore moved to the optional section of the coding tool. This decision was made primarily to reduce the time taken to complete the coding tool.</p></sec><sec><title>Inter-rater reliability scores</title><p>At the consultation level, coders agreed on the presence or absence of safety-netting advice for 32/32 consultations (100% <italic>&#x003ba;</italic> = 1.0). At the problem level, coders agreed on the presence or absence of safety-netting advice for 49/55 problems (89% <italic>&#x003ba;</italic> = 0.77). The ICC for the number of separate times safety-netting advice was discussed in each consultation and for each medical problem was 0.88 and 0.73 respectively. A contributing factor towards the lower ICC for safety-netting advice per medical problem was if generic safety-netting advice, for example, <italic>&#x02018;any problems let me know&#x02019;</italic>, was not listed under all the problems it could have applied to.</p><p>Incidents where one coder missed an episode of safety-netting advice but incorrectly labelled a non-safety-netting contingency plan (exclusion criteria, <xref rid="table3" ref-type="table">Box 1</xref>) occurred once for coder 1 and three times for coder 2. This only positively affected the IRR results for the presence or absence of safety-netting advice for one consultation and one medical problem. Because agreement scores do not differentiate between correct agreements and false agreements, the authors also reported how many of the 51 discrete episodes of safety-netting advice each coder correctly identified and any false positives. Full details of correct and false positive identification of safety-netting advice by coders are shown in Supplementary Table 3. Coder 1 correctly identified 48/51 (94.1%) episodes of safety-netting advice, whereas coder 2 correctly identified 45/51 (88.2%) of episodes.</p><p>The review process identified 51 separate episodes where the GPs gave safety-netting advice for 35 problems in 24 consultations. <xref rid="table1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> demonstrates the IRR scores assessed in the coding tool. One code &#x02018;does the safety-netting advice apply to this problem or multiple problems?&#x02019; was wholly dependent on the screening for the presence or absence of safety-netting advice for each problem, therefore IRR was not reassessed. The mean average unweighted percentage agreement was 88% (90% weighted) and mean average <italic>&#x003ba;</italic> score was 0.66 for the final tool.</p></sec><sec><title>Final tool</title><p>The final codebook and coding tool are included as Supplementary Tables 1 and 4.

The tool allows for quantification of all the different components of safety-netting advice including: whether the clinician or patient initiate the advice; the stage of the consultation at which the advice is discussed; the formatting of the advice; the strength of the advice endorsement; the number and type of conditions or symptoms the patients are informed to look out for; whether the advice is generic or specific; how the patient should seek further help and how quickly they need to act; how patients respond to the advice; whether patients ask further questions about the advice; if any written information is given; and if the clinicians document any safety-netting advice in the medical notes. The tool also includes codes designed to capture contextual data for each problem raised during the consultations, such as the communication of any diagnostic uncertainty, the expected time course of the illness, and whether any follow-up is arranged for the problem.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>In the face of uncertainty around the reach of the term &#x02018;safety netting&#x02019;, a clear definition of &#x02018;safety-netting advice&#x02019; was generated based on the published literature and a robust set of inclusion and exclusion criteria was created that was grounded in the published literature, clinical experience, and, perhaps most importantly, from watching multiple real-life consultations.</p><p>IRR testing between two coders demonstrated the tool could be reliably used to evaluate safety-netting advice in GP consultations with an overall percentage agreement of 88% (unweighted), which exceeded the pre-set target of 85% for this study. The mean average <italic>&#x003ba;</italic> score of 0.66 is deemed &#x02018;substantial&#x02019; agreement by Landis and Koch, and falls into the second highest category of agreement levels.<xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p><p>Only one episode was not adequately explained by the categories available in the format section of the codebook. This example was omitted from the IRR scoring and the codebook updated with this minor alteration. Though it is possible that there might be other cases that could be considered safety-netting advice that may not fit the codebook, the tool has been extensively tested and applied to a total of 390 episodes.<xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></p><p>When assessing IRR, weighted <italic>&#x003ba;</italic> scores were used with caution owing to their inherent subjectivity but potentially could have been utilised more. For example, the authors asked coders to differentiate if the action advised in the safety-netting advice was to return to the practice or specifically the same GP. These actions are very similar, and, potentially, it would be too stringent to treat them as unweighted codes, which may underestimate the true IRR of the tool.</p><p>Though <italic>&#x003ba;</italic> scores are a widely accepted method of assessing IRR they are not without issues. First, two codes (who initiates the advice; and is written advice given) returned <italic>&#x003ba;</italic> scores of 0 yet had high percentage agreements (96% and 94% respectively). This is because of the very low incidence of patient-initiated safety-netting advice and written advice, which creates a high level of expected agreement in the <italic>&#x003ba;</italic> statistic calculation. This penalisation is recognised as part of the <italic>&#x003ba;</italic> statistic &#x02018;paradox&#x02019; and therefore may underestimate the IRR of the coding tool.<xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Both weighted and unweighted percentage agreement scores have been provided for this reason. Second, <italic>&#x003ba;</italic> scores are also influenced by the number of variable categories available and therefore the individual <italic>&#x003ba;</italic> scores for each code best represent the IRR rather than the overall mean average <italic>&#x003ba;</italic>.<xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></p><p>In an ideal coding tool all codes should be independent of one another to avoid double penalisation or reward of a single decision, which was not always possible. For example, the documentation of follow-up is dependent on whether the coder thought any follow-up was present in the first instance. To avoid double penalisation or reward only IRR of this code was assessed when both coders agreed there was some form of follow-up. Fortunately, there were no cases where coders disagreed that there were at least some follow-up plans in place and all disagreements originated from the type of follow-up code. Furthermore, to avoid over-inflating IRR scores for documentation codes, agreement scores were not included if no medical notes were available.</p><p>Some codes that returned poor IRR scores had to be collapsed down into broader categories or removed. Two codes that were deemed essential had to undergo a further round of testing after additional refinement. Other limitations included the fact that only coder ratings by two coders were used in the formal assessment of IRR, both of whom were involved in the development of the tool. However, by creating a detailed codebook to accompany the tool, the authors have included specific examples and clear explanations to aid assignment of codes for future coders. Furthermore, when multiple actions were included in the safety-netting advice, the authors chose to code the highest &#x02018;action&#x02019; variable recommended. For example, if a GP recommended that a patient return to them for help or if it was out-of-hours (OOH) to ring 111, the action would be coded as &#x02018;contact OOH services&#x02019;. Future editions of the coding tool could potentially map different symptoms listed by the GP onto separate actions, but this may make the coding tool more labour intensive.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with existing literature</title><p>Although there are numerous other coding tools that assess other specific parts of the consultation, this study is the first to describe a tool specifically designed to quantify the delivery and receipt of safety-netting advice.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> A comparable iterative method of code generation and refinement was used, followed by rigorous formal IRR testing using a well-recognised method of agreement grading.<xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> One other study in Danish primary care has utilised traditional conversation analysis (CA) methods to evaluate safety-netting communication behaviours<xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> and, though the tool in the present study has some foundations built in CA methods, it is designed to require much less training to apply than full CA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Implications for research and practice</title><p>The presented tool will allow for the systematic assessment of safety-netting communication behaviours in video- and audio-recorded primary care consultations.<xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> This will permit further evaluation of prior research findings, for example, that safety-netting advice is often not documented in the medical notes and tends to be vague<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></p><p>The present findings suggest that this tool, in its current format, cannot be used to reliably determine if the GP checked patient understanding of the safety-netting advice (low IRR). It may only be possible to assess this by means of a patient-completed questionnaire after the consultation. This is likely to provide a more accurate assessment of patient understanding, as patients may be too embarrassed to admit that they have not understood a doctor&#x02019;s advice when asked directly in a consultation.<xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Minor adaptations, such as reducing the number of codes, may be required for use in live consultations where immediate feedback is required, as the current tool was tested on recorded consultations where coders had the ability to replay sections of the consultation.</p><p>In summary, the authors have developed a tool that can be used to systematically evaluate clinician safety-netting communication behaviours, but further research is required to determine how patients interpret different forms of safety-netting advice and the effect they might have on clinical outcomes.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank their patient and public involvement group who helped evaluate and refine the tool, all the doctors and patients who participated in the original One in a Million study, and the UnPAC study &#x02018;Understanding the causes of miscommunication in primary care consultations for children with acute cough&#x02019; funded by the NIHR School for Primary Care Research.</p></ack><notes><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This project was funded as part of Peter Edwards&#x02019; Elizabeth Blackwell Clinical Primer Research Fellowship, which was supported by the Wellcome Trust Institutional Strategic Support Fund and Avon Primary Care Research Collaborative (grant reference number ISSF3: 204813/Z/16/Z).

Moreover, primary care staff commonly report low confidence levels in managing common MSK conditions,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> further increasing the need for specialist MSK and, a related discipline, sport and exercise medicine (SEM) knowledge within GP.</p><p>The current health system within the UK dictates that patients with MSK/SEM symptoms are initially reviewed by the GP and then referred on to secondary care when further investigation and management is required. The secondary care options include an appointment in hospital with an orthopaedic specialist or review within orthopaedic Integrated Clinical Assessment and Treatment units (ICATs), typically within a community-based healthcare centre. However, waiting times for these specialties are long and waiting times for elective care are a common source of patient dissatisfaction within healthcare systems.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>

The study methodology and provisional results have been previously reported,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> but the current study develops the initial paper<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> further by extending the analysis to 6&#x02005;months.</p><p>The GP practice uses Egton Medical Information Systems (EMIS) electronic patient records and is based approximately two miles from Belfast city centre. The practice introduced an MSK and SEM clinic staffed by one GP with a specialist interest in MSK and SEM conditions, with appropriate postgraduate qualifications in these areas, and its performance was reviewed over two 3-month time periods between August and October 2014 and then again between January and March 2015. A monthly 4&#x02005;h clinic was held over these time periods and appointment times were approximately 20&#x02005;min. All primary care staff within the practice could refer to the clinic any patient with MSK and/or SEM presentations, on whom they wanted some specialist input. Management options included injection therapy, exercise prescription and onward referrals to appropriate colleagues, for example, physiotherapy. No ethical approval was required for this study as it was an audit of a new service within routine GP.</p><p>The practice's performance during the running of the clinic was compared with the same time periods in 2013 and 2014 to control for other variables except for the introduction of the GP-based MSK and SEM clinic. The variables which were monitored included cases seen in the clinic, waiting times, treatments given and onward referral to colleagues from the clinic.</p><p>Equipment which was available to the GP within the GP-based MSK and SEM clinic included a clinical room with a computer to allow access to the patients&#x02019; GP clinical records, a couch and lighting. There were also facilities to undertake joint injections under appropriate sterile conditions. Within the primary care clinic, there was access to laboratory blood tests (to exclude an inflammatory condition) and imaging, including open access radiology for plain films. If needed, patients could be referred for input to orthopaedic ICATs and hospital specialties, including rheumatology and orthopaedics, using the typical referral methods.</p><p>Ten patients were randomly selected to complete a patient satisfaction questionnaire (see online <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bmjopensem.bmj.com/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1136/bmjsem-2015-000027/-/DC1">supplementary appendix</ext-link> 1). The patients were approached by the practice administration staff to complete the questionnaire via a paper copy after they had finished their clinic visit.

The cost in NI of a routine hospital orthopaedic outpatient review in 2014 was &#x000a3;213 and the average orthopaedic ICAT cost per attendance was &#x000a3;82 (information obtained through direct communications with the finance department of the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety (DHSSPS; NI)), whereas the cost of 1&#x02005;h of GP-patient contact, including direct care staff costs with qualification costs, for 2013&#x02013;2014 was &#x000a3;183 (information obtained through direct communications with the finance department of DHSSPS (NI)). Three patients were at least seen per hour and therefore the cost per patient reviewed at the GP-based MSK and SEM clinic was conservatively costed at &#x000a3;61 per patient in 2014. Therefore, if all the clinic's patients were reviewed within a hospital orthopaedic outpatient clinic, the cost to the NI health service would have been &#x000a3;17&#x02005;679, or within the orthopaedic ICAT system the cost would have been &#x000a3;6806. This is compared with the &#x000a3;5063 which it cost to run the GP-based MSK and SEM clinic, a potential saving of between &#x000a3;1743 and &#x000a3;12&#x02005;616 per 83 patients reviewed.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s5"><title>Discussion</title><p>Thirty-five and then 48 patients were reviewed at the GP-based MSK and SEM clinic in 2014 and 2015, respectively, all within 4&#x02005;weeks of initial presentation to their own GP. Patient satisfaction with the service was generally very high, with all patients preferring to be reviewed within their own GP surgery rather than being referred to a hospital or another community-based health centre, in keeping with the principles of Transforming Your Care.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> This study extends the analysis of the implementation of a unique MSK/SEM into routine GP to 6&#x02005;months and builds on our previously published quality improvement work.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><sec id="s5a"><title>Referral trends</title><p>Onward orthopaedic referrals from the GP practice were reduced by 11 during the study period compared with the same time periods in 2014 and 2015. MSK presentations to the GP practice in 2014 were reduced by 114 compared with the same time frame in 2013. This statistic was unfortunately not available for the 2015 cohort of patients due to changes within the computer system. This reduction in MSK presentations to the GP surgery could be explained by a more efficient management of these symptoms within the surgery, with patients utilising the GP-based MSK and SEM clinic and receiving appropriate management rather than continually re-presenting to their own GP on multiple occasions. The reduction in X-ray referrals, 93 during the full study period, has potentially significant consequences for patients, with radiation from X-rays being associated with certain adverse health consequences.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Five referrals were made from the clinic to secondary care (two to physiotherapy and one each to rheumatology, orthopaedics and occupational therapy). However, if this clinic did not exist, then all 83 patients seen in the clinic would have been referred to secondary care for input. This clinic therefore successfully reduced the burden on secondary care for orthopaedic and MSK referrals.</p></sec><sec id="s5b"><title>Prevalence of various MSK conditions</title><p>The main presenting conditions/symptoms in this project related to the shoulder, with supraspinatus and subacromial bursitis being the most common area for pathology. However, the back and knee have been reported as the most common body regions causing patients to attend their GP in patients with MSK symptoms,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> whereas other studies concluded that the back and neck were the most common presenting areas.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>This difference may be explained by the fact that the GP-based MSK and SEM clinic was receiving referrals from primary care, and the GPs were therefore filtering out these other MSK presentations within their own clinics. Previous authors have also found that women present more commonly than men for MSK problems,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> in keeping with our findings. This information should also be utilised when teaching GPs about primary care MSK medicine and the common joints which present to GPs. This would allow GPs to feel more confident in managing common MSK and SEM symptoms and therefore reduce the secondary care referral burden.</p></sec><sec id="s5c"><title>Economic considerations</title><p>Having a GP-based MSK and SEM clinic has the potential for significant cost savings for the NHS. Managing patients within their own GP practice through utilisation of a GP with a specialist interest in MSK and SEM conditions in this current project had a potential cost saving of between &#x000a3;1743 and &#x000a3;12&#x02005;616 per 83 patients reviewed. This does not include the reductions in hospital, physiotherapy and X-ray referrals seen within this study as well as fewer MSK presentations to the GP surgery and these cost savings are therefore conservative. This economic saving was achieved with high patient satisfaction and occurs at a time when the Belfast Trust is under significant economic pressure.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p></sec><sec id="s5d"><title>Challenges, lessons and future directions</title><p>One of the main issues encountered during the process for the GP leading the MSK and SEM clinic was that the Trust does not have guidelines for patients on oral anticoagulants receiving intra-articular injections. This should be remedied by the Trust, particularly with the advent of the newer oral anticoagulant agents, although previous authors have suggested that joint injections with a therapeutic international normalised ratio is safe.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>With regard to the future development of this service, it is hoped that this model will provide the blueprint for a further roll-out of GP-based MSK and SEM clinics within NI. To enable patients to receive the best possible care within these clinics, it is hoped that GPs with a specialist interest in MSK and SEM will be able to be trained in the use of MSK ultrasound&#x02014;the &#x02018;stethoscope&#x02019; of modern medicine.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> This skill would be able to be utilised as both an investigation and to help with patient management via, for example, ultrasound-guided injections, and the provision of this service should be reviewed to illustrate if it provides a further cost saving to the MSK and SEM service.</p><p>A further improvement to the service could be made by providing both platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and whole-blood injections in addition to the current provision of corticosteroid injections, for muscle,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> tendinopathic<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and arthritic conditions,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16&#x02013;18</xref> if supported by an appropriate evidence base.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> This project also provides GPs with information on which MSK and SEM conditions commonly present to GP and which some GPs may have difficulty managing, particularly around the shoulder and knee. GPs and GP trainees should therefore be provided with appropriate education to help address this learning need and further reduce the onward referral from primary care of MSK and SEM conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Strengths and weaknesses</title><p>The review of referral rates from the GP practice is dependent on the primary care staff coding appropriately and our statistics are therefore limited by the quality of the information which the staff enters into the system. This may therefore lead to underestimating or overestimating referral rates. The statistics available from the primary care computer system, EMIS, for the two study time frames were different due to mandatory changes to the computer system. The diagnoses made were largely clinical and we would have ideally confirmed these with appropriate imaging, but a pragmatic approach was taken to investigate and manage the patients, in keeping with &#x02018;normal&#x02019; primary care.</p><p>This study was performed in one GP practice, which allowed us 100% follow-up of our patients, but our sample size was relatively small with no long-term follow-up. The next stage for the quality improvement project will be to replicate these findings within a larger geographical area, with long-term follow-up of patients, and then present the findings to local commissioners to further extend this trial across different areas of the UK.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Summary</title><p>With the financial constraints now faced by the NHS and new healthcare policies shifting focus from hospital-based to community-based management options, we present a novel service model for managing MSK and SEM problems in primary care. This model can make sound economic sense and deliver high patient satisfaction within primary care, with low waiting times, helping to reduce the referral burden on secondary care from primary care. We present a reproducible model that can be commissioned as a service by the local clinical commissioning groups and be extended throughout the NI and UK health service as part of Transforming Your Care policy.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p></sec>

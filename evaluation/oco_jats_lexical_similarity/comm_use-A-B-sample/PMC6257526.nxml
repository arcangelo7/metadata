angiosarcomas are the most commonly reported histologic type. Primary angiosarcoma
is also a rare clinical entity, with an incidence of 0.0001% in collected autopsy
series<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. It's typically located within the right atrium as
large symptomatic masses and known to be rapidly fatal, with the diagnoses usually
determined only at autopsy. It frequently extends to the pericardium, vena cava, or
tricuspid valve, causing tamponade and/or heart inflow obstruction<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Early heart transplantation and
novel radiation therapy approaches may offer a survival benefit in non-metastatic
tumors, but up to 80% of the patients present with systemic metastasis at
diagnosis<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. Metastases
are common, and often widespread. Clinical diagnosis of angiosarcoma is often
difficult because there are no specific symptoms associated with the disease.
Symptoms can be either cardiac or systemic. The majority of the literature describes
a uniformly dismal prognosis with a median survival of only 6 months for these
aggressive tumors<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. Additionally, with the aid of newer imaging
techniques, localization, biopsy diagnosis and resection of the atrial tumors are
now being achieved more often, with some improvement in survival.</p><p>Complete surgical resection confers the best long-term outcome but may be
contraindicated because of anatomic considerations in advanced tumors<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. We report a patient with a right
atrial angiosarcoma which first presented clinically as a cerebral tumor mimicking a
glioma.</p></sec><sec><title>CASE REPORT</title><p>A 47-year-old female was presented to a private hospital with a history of recurrent
facial paralysis and left hemiparesis. The patient had no other pertinent past
medical history. After a marked right-sided visual field defect developed, various
investigations disclosed a tumor in the right parieto-occipital region. A cranial
mass was identified at cranial magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>) and she underwent neurosurgery operation. It was
surgically resected and found to be a 3-cm spherical red mass with central necrosis,
sharply demarcated from the surrounding brain tissue by a thin condensation of
fibrous tissue. It was composed entirely of well-formed, blood-filled, anastomosing
sinusoidal-type spaces formed by branching trabeculae of loose fibrocellular stroma
covered by an endothelial cell lining, generally single-layered with occasional
doubling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). Mitoses were quite
uncommon. This lesion was reported as a hemangioma, although the atypical location
and histologic features were noted. These immunohistochemical examination was
determined as metastatic angiosarcoma. She also got adjuvant chemotherapy. The
regimen of the therapy administered by medical oncology department was doxorubicin
(75 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) and ifosfamide (7500 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) with a duration of 6
cycles of combination treatment.</p><p><fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The lesion in the right parietal lobe hyperintense on the long MRI image

enhancement (B). The lesion grew on several studies and was a surgically
proven to be hemangiosarcoma.&#x000a0;</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-33-05-0525-g01"/></fig></p><p><fig id="f2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>The pathology of the resected tumor from parietal lobe confirms

pericardial friction rub but no increased jugular venous pressure or dependent
edema. She was transferred to our institution and underwent transesophageal
echocardiography, which showed a homogeneous mass that involved the free wall of the
right atrium. The patient then underwent computed tomography (CT), MR imaging, and
angiography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). Findings from the mass
suggested a diagnosis of cardiac angiosarcoma as 3x3 cm. Electrocardiogram showed
normal sinus rhythm with nonspecific ST wave changes. Chest X-ray revealed
cardiomegaly and a pericardial effusion, confirmed by echocardiography. An abdominal
ultrasound showed only an enlarged liver. By evaluation of our heart team, we
decided to proceed with complete surgical resection of primary tumor.</p><p><fig id="f3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Preoperative cardiac images with different screening methods. A)

arterial and bicaval venous cannulation were performed. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)
was achieved. Cardiac arrest was achieved with blood cardioplegia. After
cross-clamping, surgical field was exposed with right atriotomy. The tumor, as well
as part of the right pericardium, were resected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>). Because of tumor involvement of anterosuperior leaflet,
tricuspid valve was reconstructed with ring annuloplasty. A piece of bovine
pericardium was used to reconstruct the right atrial wall via continue suture
technique. And due to resection of the right coronary artery with the tumor, distal
anastomosis of coronary bypass surgery with saphenous vein was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>). Proximal anastomosis was performed
with side clamped as well. She has weaned from the CPB smoothly. Heparin
neutralization with protamine was performed.</p><p><fig id="f4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Resected primary cardiac angiosarcoma intraoperative images. A) inferior

During the operation, mean arterial pressure was maintained at 70 mmHg. By the end
of CBP, the patient was transferred to intensive care unit (ICU) with a
hemodynamically stable condition. She was extubated on the postoperative
7<sup>th</sup> hour.</p><p>Total drainage was 500 cc. After one night staying in ICU, the patient was discharged
in good condition after the 7<sup>th</sup> day of the operation. Follow up
echocardiographic controls revealed clean cardiac cavities. The control routine
biochemistry was normal and 9<sup>th</sup> month PET scan was also clean.</p><p>In the present report, a patient with cardiac angiosarcoma and distant metastases was
treated with a combination of chemotherapy and surgical resections. The patient
responded well to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and the tumor and metastases decreased
to an extent that made complete surgical resection feasible. Surgical resection was
successful in removing the mass and subsequent chemotherapy was used to destroy any
remaining tumor cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Even up to 80% of the patients present with systemic metastasis at diagnosis, and in
the case reported on this article primary cardiac angiosarcoma with rare
manifestation with cerebral metastasis was treated successfully with neoadjuvant and
adjuvant chemotherapy and complete surgical resection of the tumor with the
reconstruction of the right atrium. With the correct combination of
multidisciplinary treatments for cardiac angiosarcoma, we hope that a cure for this
disease is possible rather than treatment regimens being used as either palliative
or life-prolonging measures.</p><p>While other authors have published case reports of long-term survival after
multidisciplinary treatment for angiosarcoma, these were patients presented without
metastases<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. This patient
was presented with several systemic metastases, but with the combination of
neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy and complete surgical resection, the patient
is currently alive and without recurrence 12 months after diagnosis with functional
class New York Heart Association grade I. Multidisciplinary approach is mandatory to
improve long-term survival.</p><p>Although this patient has not experienced recurrence, this is an unusual case and
diligence in the surveillance for new tumor growth is, therefore, imperative.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="50%" span="1"/><col width="50%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">AAD</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Substantial contributions to the conception or design

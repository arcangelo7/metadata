open repair<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. However, the long term reintervention rate is
high<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Migration and type I endoleaks are serious adverse
events and indicate EVAR failure<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. Distal migration of the main body,
within a long infrarenal neck, may be treated by inserting an extender cuff,
provided there is some overlap between the main body and neck<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. More extensive
forms of migration, when the main body is no longer contained within the neck
(complete migration), may mandate conversion to open repair<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. We will describe a medical high-risk patient presented with a
completely migrated stent-graft (MG), abdominal pain, and a 10.5 cm infrarenal
abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The patient was treated by placing a second modular
bifurcated endograft (SG) within and above the MG. Appropriate consent was obtained
from the patient.</p></sec><sec><title>CASE REPORT</title><p>A 72-year old male presented with abdominal pain. Medical history included
hypertension, diabetes and coronary artery disease. He had undergone endovascular
repair, 6 cm AAA, five years before and had not returned for follow-up.</p><p>The computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 10.5 cm infrarenal AAA and a totally
migrated AneuRx<sup>TM</sup> stent-graft (Medtronic Inc. Minneapolis, USA). There
was a complete displacement and angulation of the stent-graft's main body within the
aneurysm sac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). Both iliac components
of the endograft were still maintained inside their respective iliac arteries (right
limb as part of the main body and left limb as an intact extension). Due to his body
mass index and comorbidities, we opted for endovascular stent-graft placement.</p><p>

</p><sec><title>Management Strategy and Planning</title><p>The plan was to place a SG within and above the existing MG. The short SG's
(Anaconda<sup>TM</sup> Stent Graft System Vascutek Terumo, Inchinnan
Renfrewshire, Glasgow, Scotland) main body should lie within the infrarenal neck
and the two iliac limbs to extend itself from the main body into the iliac limbs
of MG. All components were oversized by 10%.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedure</title><p>The main body of SG (24F) was introduced from the right femoral artery and
deployed just below the renal arteries. The distance between the distal end of
SG and the proximal end of MG was 40 mm. The left limb of SG's main body was
cannulated by attaching the ipsilateral and contralateral magnets within the
MG's main body. The contralateral magnet wire was then exchanged for a
Lunderquist wire. A 17 mm x 140 mm contralateral iliac limb was used to bridge
the gap between SG and MG, landing into the left iliac limb of MG. An
ipsilateral 17 mm x 140 mm iliac limb was deployed from the right iliac limb of
SG into the right limb of MG. Thus, a new modular endograft was inserted above
and into the MG, thereby excluding the aneurysm sac from blood flow.
Intraoperative angiogram didn't reveal endoleaks. Pedal pulses were palpable
postoperatively. The duration of the procedure was 1 hour and 30 minutes.</p><p>The patient was discharged 72 hours later. CT scans at 6 weeks, 6 months and 18
months showed intact endograft components, absence of endoleaks and shrinkage of
the aneurysm sac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). He returned
after 36 months with chest pain, hypotension and loss of sensation in both lower
limbs. Investigations confirmed acute myocardial infarction (MI), lower limb
ischemia and severe renal dysfunction. Ultrasound revealed absence of blood flow
within the stent-graft. He was assessed as being too ill for any cardiological
or vascular intervention. He demised within 48 hours of admission. It was
unclear whether it was the lower limb ischemia or cardiac ischemia that
initiated his current condition.</p><p>

</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) define migration as the movement of the
endograft by 10 mm relative to anatomical landmarks or any migration leading to
symptoms or requiring therapy<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.
There are no guidelines for treating complete migration<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. Open repair is the recommended procedure of choice
to treat complete migration.</p><p>In this case, due to inflammation, graft component incorporation and the prohibitive
comorbidities, endovascular repair seemed to be a better option. The use of an
extender cuff only was not an option because the graft had completely migrated. The
Anaconda<sup>TM</sup> device was chosen. Its short main body allowed a "working
length" to place two iliac extension limbs between SG and MG. The lower limb
ischemia prior to his death could have been due to component occlusion, kinking or
migration. Stent-graft thrombus secondary to MI and hypotension was also possible.
In appropriate individuals, such "off-label" use of EVAR devices requires a stricter
follow-up or even conversion to open repair at a later stage if the patient's
general condition allows it.</p><p>Although EVAR relining by using a second infrarenal endograft seems to be a feasible
alternative to immediate open surgery in high-risk patients, with a complete MG,
other options need to be investigated. Customizing EVAR devices in this setting
demands more investigation.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="50%" span="1"/><col width="50%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">JP</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Substantial contributions to the conception or design

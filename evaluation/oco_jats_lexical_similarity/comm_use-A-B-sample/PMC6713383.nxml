autopsy reports<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. Cardiac valve tumors such as cardiac papillary
fibroelastomas (CPF) are a subset of masses that, if left untreated, can lead to
devastating complications including embolization, stroke, and
death<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. When a cardiac mass is suspected, a thorough
evaluation of the patient&#x02019;s cardiac anatomy and function using echocardiography is
imperative. When angina is present, additional diagnostic testing should be
performed to determine whether symptoms originate from the mass or another cardiac
pathology. Unfortunately, invasive testing such as cardiac catheterization may
predispose these patients to embolic complications. We propose that non-invasive
coronary angiography using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or dynamic computed
tomography (CT) may be considered in lieu of coronary catheterization in this
uncommon patient population. We describe a patient with a symptomatic aortic valve
tumor that was successfully diagnosed with non-invasive angiography and managed with
valve-sparing excision. Informed consent and Institutional Review Board approval
were obtained for reporting this case.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>CASE REPORT</title><sec><title>Patient Information</title><p>A 77-year-old female with a history of myocardial ischemia and coronary artery
disease who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention nine years ago had
recently developed exertional angina, shortness of breath, and near syncope. Her
symptoms began a few months prior but had recently become more severe.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Findings</title><p>On auscultation, she had a systolic ejection murmur that radiated to the neck,
bilaterally. The remainder of her physical exam was otherwise unremarkable.</p></sec><sec><title>Diagnostic Assessment</title><p>Two-dimensional echocardiogram showed a 1.5 cm x 0.8 cm globular mass on the wall
of the left sinus of Valsalva just above the aortic valve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>) and moderately reduced aortic valve area of 1.5
cm<sup>2</sup> as estimated by the continuity equation. Her mean aortic
valve gradient was 10 mmHg and her peak aortic velocity was 2.2 m/s. Left
ventricular ejection fraction was 60% and no mitral regurgitation was detected.
Given her history of coronary artery disease, she required an evaluation of her
coronary arteries to rule out significant atherosclerosis. However, the location
of the mass on the left coronary cusp would have made it precarious to cannulate
the coronary ostium for catheterization. Thus, we elected to perform noninvasive
evaluation using dynamic CT angiography. The study did not show evidence of
obstructive coronary artery disease but did prominently display the mass during
the cardiac cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3</xref>). It appeared the mass would abut the left
coronary ostium during systole, which may have explained her symptoms.</p><p>

</p></sec><sec><title>Therapeutic Intervention</title><p>The mass was removed surgically through a median sternotomy. The patient was
placed on cardiopulmonary bypass and the heart was arrested. The aorta was
opened, and upon inspection of the aortic valve, the mass was found to originate
from a stalk on the left coronary cusp. The 1.5 cm mass was found to have a
sessile attachment to the free edge of the left coronary leaflet and was removed
without disrupting the architecture of the aortic valve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>). Post-operative echocardiography showed no aortic
insufficiency and improvement in aortic valve function. The aortic valve area
had increased to 1.7cm<sup>2</sup> while her mean aortic valve pressure gradient
and peak aortic velocity had decreased to 6 mmHg and 1.6 m/s, respectively.</p><p>

surgery, her chest tubes were removed post-op day 2 and she was transferred to
the floor post-op day 3. From postoperative days 4 to 8, the patient was
medically stable but awaited social placement. She was evaluated by physical
therapy for deconditioning and was recommended outpatient rehabilitation, given
supplemental oxygen, and discharged on postoperative day 8. Pathology revealed a
cardiac papillary fibroelastoma (CPF).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>CPFs are rare, benign lesions that represent 10% of all primary cardiac tumors and
present frequently on the valves, with a predilection for the aortic
valve<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. Histological examination reveals that embolic
complications often occur from either the fragile papillary fronds of the tumor or
thrombus aggregation on the superficial endothelial layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>) <sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. In several retrospective single-center studies,
roughly 32% of patients were symptomatic and presented with neurological events
(syncope, transient ischemic attack, stroke), coronary ischemia (angina, myocardial
infarction, cardiac arrest, sudden death), peripheral embolization, outflow
obstruction, or valvular insufficiency<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. Our patient&#x02019;s presentation was more consistent
with aortic stenosis. Her tumor was located on the free edge of the left coronary
leaflet on the aortic side. At 1.5 cm, this tumor may have prevented the left
leaflet from opening completely, resulting in left ventricular outflow obstruction.
In addition, the tumor may have transiently occluded the orifice to the left
coronary artery, leading to chest discomfort and dyspnea on exertion. Upon suspicion
of a CPF, the friability, mobility, and location of the mass should be evaluated in
order to decide on the appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Clinical history may
indicate tumor friability, and echocardiogram may reveal tumor mobility and
location<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. However, given our patient&#x02019;s symptoms and history
of coronary artery disease, it was also imperative to determine the source of her
angina and consider the need for coronary artery bypass. Due to the location of the
mass, it was felt that conventional catheter angiography was contraindicated owing
to the risk of systemic embolization. Dynamic CT angiography was a valuable
alternative that provided useful information regarding coronary blood flow and
helped rule out hemodynamically significant stenosis; it provided higher-quality,
three-dimensional imaging that allowed us to delineate her coronary anatomy,
characterize the mass, and complete her cardiac workup prior to surgery. The
additional radiation exposure and risk of contrast-induced nephropathy were
warranted. Without appropriate assessment, undiagnosed coronary artery disease may
go untreated at the time of surgery, increasing the risk of postoperative
complications such as myocardial infarction and death.</p><p>Review of the literature revealed that echocardiography was the modality most often
used to diagnosis CPFs. In a single-center retrospective review of 162
pathologically confirmed cases, Sun et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> reported the sensitivity and specificity
of transthoracic echocardiography in the detection of CPF &#x02265;0.2 cm to be 88.9%
and 87.8%, respectively. Echocardiography may provide a dynamic view of the mass
and, if associated with a valve, may describe valvular pathology attributed to the
mass&#x02019;s presence. However, recent advancements in spatial and temporal resolution
allow dynamic CT and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging to play a more prominent
role in the workup of cardiac masses. Carpenter et al. report a case of exertional
angina that necessitated the stepwise use of stress electrocardiography, catheter
angiography, dynamic CT angiography, and cardiac MRI to diagnose a
CPF<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. Additionally, our case further highlights the
utility of these newer modalities in mitigating the risk of embolic complications.
In cases of suspected concomitant ischemic pathology, we propose that non-invasive
coronary angiography using MRI or dynamic CT may be considered in lieu of coronary
catheterization in this uncommon patient population. Surgical treatment is indicated
for symptomatic patients to prevent further ischemic or thromboembolic events.
Excision is curative with valve-sparing procedures being feasible in the majority of
cases<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. However, the surgical management of asymptomatic
patients with an incidental cardiac valve tumor is controversial. Gowda et al.
reported 12 tumor-related deaths from embolization or obstruction of the coronaries
in the cases of 25 medically-treated CPF patients, suggesting that the likelihood of
developing significant symptoms over time should not be
ignored<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Thus, Ikegami et al., in their review, recommend
surgical treatment for all incidentally found CPF<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. Furthermore, Miller et
al. suggest patients be placed on systemic anticoagulation until the tumor can be
removed<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. Since the incidence of cardiac valve tumors is
rare, it is unlikely that the best management of asymptomatic patients will be
clearly elucidated by a randomized control trial. Therefore, we believe that any
patient who is otherwise a candidate for cardiac surgery should have left-sided
cardiac valve tumors removed, regardless of symptomatology. Right-sided lesions, in
the absence of a septal defect, may be managed initially with anticoagulation and
need for surgery should be determined on a case-by-case basis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, cardiac valve tumors are extremely rare, with potential for
devastating complications. If diagnosed, cardiac catheterization should be avoided
to minimize the risk of embolic events. In symptomatic patients, dynamic CT
angiography can clarify coronary artery anatomy and define the tumor prior to
surgical excision.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="5%" span="1"/><col width="95%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Author's roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">VSR</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Substantial contributions to the

Connexin 43 (Cx43) hemichannels (HCs) in osteocytes play an important role in osteocyte viability, bone formation, and remodeling. We showed here that estrogen deficiency reduced Cx43 expression and HC function. To determine if functional HCs protect osteocytes and bone loss during estrogen deficiency, we adopted an ovariectomy model in wild-type (WT) and two transgenic Cx43 mice: R76W (dominant-negative mutant inhibiting only gap junction channels) and Cx43 &#x00394;130&#x02013;136 (dominant-negative mutant compromising both gap junction channels and HCs). The bone mineral density (BMD), bone structure, and histomorphometric changes of cortical and trabecular bones after ovariectomy were investigated. Our results showed that the &#x00394;130&#x02013;136 transgenic cohort had greatly decreased vertebral trabecular bone mass compared to WT and R76W mice, associated with a significant increase in the number of apoptotic osteocyte and empty lacunae. Moreover, osteoclast surfaces in trabecular and cortical bones were increased after ovariectomy in the R76W and WT mice, respectively, but not in &#x02206;130&#x02013;136 mice. These data demonstrate that impairment of Cx43 HCs in osteocytes accelerates vertebral trabecular bone loss and increase in osteocyte apoptosis, and further suggest that Cx43 HCs in osteocytes protect trabecular bone against catabolic effects due to estrogen deficiency.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="LongSummary"><title>Osteoporosis: Hemichannels protect bone from estrogen deficiency</title><p id="Par2">Channels that form between cells and their extracellular environment help protect bone tissue from the damage wrought by low estrogen levels, a major cause of bone loss in post-menopausal women. Jean Jiang from the UT Health San Antonio and colleagues showed that depleting the estrogen hormone in mouse bone cells reduced levels of connexin 43 and impaired the protein&#x02019;s ability to forms pores known as &#x02018;hemichannels&#x02019;. The researchers surgically removed the ovaries of various mouse strains to induce estrogen deficiencies. They found that transgenic mice without working hemichannels had reduced bone mass compared to normal mice or mice that could make hemichannels but lacked the ability for those channels to come together to form complete passageways. The findings highlight the importance of connexin 43 hemichannels in protecting bone tissue against osteoporosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Bone quality and biomechanics</kwd><kwd>Bone</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Health &#x00026; Human Services | National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR072020; CA196214</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Jean X.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AQ-1507</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Jean X.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Osteoporosis and osteopenia, diseases of low bone mineral density (BMD), are common among postmenopausal women and feature a high risk of fragility fracture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> Decreased estrogen is closely associated with an increase in osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and a decrease in osteoblast-mediated bone formation, which contribute to bone loss during aging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> Furthermore, estrogen deficiency, oxidative stress (OS), micro-damage, and aging influence the viability of osteocytes, which are required for mediating the efficient bone remodeling, quality maintenance, and damage repair processes of bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup></p><p id="Par4">Osteocytes, comprising about 95% of bone cells, are embedded within the bone matrix and communicate with neighboring osteocytes and cells on the bone surface (BS) through an extensive network of long dendritic processes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> Gap junctions are intercellular channels that provide direct cell&#x02013;cell communication between adjacent cells.

We also examined the expression of osteocytic Cx43 in bone sections from OVX and sham mice by immunohistochemistry.

However, the open probability of HCs is very low under physiological conditions, and the activation of HCs is regulated by many factors, including mechanical stimulation, extracellular calcium concentration, plasma membrane voltage, protein&#x02013;protein interactions, and redox status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup> Estrogen deficiency in MLO-Y4 cells has been reported to attenuate NO and PGE<sub>2</sub> release and expression of DMP-1, SOST, and other bone-specific genes, thus diminishing osteocyte mechanosensitivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> Moreover, our earlier study shows that OS activates HCs in osteocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup> The opening of HCs mediates the release of factors, including ATP, PGEs, and other factors, from osteocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup> ATP can stimulate the formation and bone resorption activity of osteoclasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup> Thus, ATP release is likely to be blocked by impaired HCs, consequently, attenuating the effect of ATP or other possible released factors on osteoclastogenesis and function. Together, besides its role in maintaining normal bone homeostasis, this study suggests a new mechanism involving Cx43 HCs in protecting osteocytes and bone tissue against cell death and catabolic effects, respectively, as a consequence of estrogen deficiency.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="Par26">MLO-Y4 cells were cultured on collagen-coated (rat tail collagen type I, BD Biosciences, 354236, 0.15&#x02009;mg&#x000b7;mL<sup>-1</sup>) surfaces and were grown in phenol red-free &#x003b1;-minimum essential medium supplemented with 2.5% fetal bovine serum and 2.5% bovine calf serum, and incubated in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Preparation of cell membrane extracts and Western blotting</title><p id="Par27">Cultured cells were collected in lysis buffer (5&#x02009;mmol&#x000b7;L<sup>-1</sup> Tris, 5&#x02009;mmol&#x000b7;L<sup>-1</sup> EDTA/EGTA, and proteinase inhibitors) and then ruptured by pipetting through a 20 gauge needle.

After scanning, noise was removed from the images by eliminating disconnected objects smaller than 4 pixels in size. Two volumes of interest were selected in the L5 vertebrae and femur midshafts and automated contouring was used to delineate trabecular and cortical bone regions. In the L5 vertebrae, the trabecular bone volume of interest (VOI) was positioned 50 slices distal to the proximal growth plate and extended 150 slices in the distal direction. The VOI conformed to the endocortical boundary. An appropriate and uniform threshold was applied to all specimens after comparing grayscale and binarized images in both groups. For trabecular bone, a grayscale value of 80 in a set of 8-bit slices was set as the threshold. After thresholding, the BV/TV (%), Tb.Th (mm), Tb.Sp (mm), and Tb.N (mm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) were quantified. Cortical bone structure was analyzed over 50 slices centered at the 55% of length (from proximal to distal) position in the femur diaphysis. We used the 55% length from the proximal end because of the low influence of the linea aspera on bone shape. This ridge is one of the insertion sites of the gluteal musculature and it contributes to an odd shape of the femur shaft. We treated all groups similarly. Grayscale values of 106 and 256 were set as the window for cortical bone.

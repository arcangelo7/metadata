MDL28170 (Tocris Bioscience), an inhibitor of calpain, was given intravenously 1&#x000a0;h before or after the scald burn. The histological score, wet/dry weight ratio, and caspase-3 activity were examined to evaluate the degree of lung damage. Calpain activity and its source were detected by an assay kit and immunofluorescence staining. The proteolysis of membrane skeleton proteins &#x003b1;-fodrin and ankyrin-B, which are substrates of calpain, was measured by Western blot.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Time-course studies showed that tissue damage reached a peak between 1 and 6&#x000a0;h post-scald burn and gradually diminished at 24&#x000a0;h. More importantly, calpain activity reached peak levels at 1&#x000a0;h and was maintained until 24&#x000a0;h, paralleled by lung damage to some extent. Western blot showed that the levels of the proteolyzed forms of &#x003b1;-fodrin and ankyrin-B correlated well with the degree of damage. MDL28170 at a dose of 3&#x000a0;mg/kg b. w. given 1&#x000a0;h before burn injury not only antagonized the increase in calpain activity but also ameliorated scald burn-induced lung injury, including the degradation of &#x003b1;-fodrin and ankyrin-B. Immunofluorescence images revealed calpain 1 and CD45 double-positive cells in the lung tissue of rats exposed to scald burn injury, suggesting that leukocytes were a dominant source of calpain. Furthermore, this change was blocked by MDL28170. Finally, MDL28170 given at 1&#x000a0;h post-scald burn injury significantly ameliorated the wet/dry weight ratio compared with burn injury alone.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Calpain, a product of infiltrating leukocytes, is a mediator of scald burn-induced acute lung injury that involves enhancement of inflammation and proteolysis of membrane skeleton proteins.

Acute lung injury occurs in the first 24 to 48&#x000a0;h post-scald&#x000a0;burn. The injury manifests as a compromised alveoli-capillary barrier, edema formation, leukocyte infiltration, and oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The vicious pathophysiological alterations cause an increase in airway resistance and abnormality of gas exchange [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Some cases are hard to prevent with instant fluid resuscitation; such patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome and burn shock, increasing the mortality risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. To date, interventions to treat acute lung injury remain limited; this fact necessitates continued basic scientific research in this field to clarify the underlying mechanisms.</p><p id="Par6">Calpains are Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, nonlysosomal cysteine proteases. Currently, 15 genes have been described in the human genome, and calpain 1 is a well-studied and ubiquitously expressed isoform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Under physiological conditions, controlled activation of calpain 1 results in the hydrolysis of target proteins, thereby initiating various biological events, including angiogenesis, cell adhesion, and memory formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. By contrast, hyperactivation of calpain 1 causes cell damage in pathological circumstances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The most common targets of attack are membrane skeleton proteins, especially &#x003b1;-fodrin and ankyrin-B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Both proteins are indispensable for maintaining cell shape and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Deficiency of these proteins is associated with defects in cell proliferation and adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and has been implicated in human diseases, including arrhythmias and metabolic syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Calpain 1 is also critical for the inflammatory response. It cleaves the inhibitor I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;, thus activating inflammation transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B. It promotes inflammatory cell infiltration and proinflammatory cytokine processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Previous studies have demonstrated that cell structure damage and leukocyte infiltration are distinguishing features in scald burn-induced acute lung injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This prompted us to hypothesize that calpain mediates scald burn-induced acute lung injury.</p><p id="Par7">Time course studies were performed to evaluate the severity of lung injuries and calpain activity after scald burn injury. The fragments levels of membrane skeleton proteins a-fodrin and ankyrin-B, which are substrates of calpain, were also examined.&#x000a0;Then, we used MDL28170 (Tocris Bioscience) to block calpain activity in intact rats and determined its effects on acute lung injury. Concomitantly, we examined calpain 1 in the infiltrating leukocytes. Moreover, to evaluate its clinical relevance, we determined the effects of MDL28170 when given 1&#x000a0;h post-scald&#x000a0;burn. Our data provided evidence that calpain, a product of infiltrating leukocytes, is a mediator of scald burn-induced acute lung injury. Its destructive actions involve enhancement of inflammation and proteolysis of membrane skeleton proteins.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animal experimental protocol</title><p id="Par8">Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200 to&#x000a0;250&#x000a0;g provided by the Laboratory Animal Center of&#x000a0;the Fourth Military Medical University&#x000a0;were included in this study.

Briefly, the rats were anesthetized via i.p. injection of 40&#x000a0;mg/kg pentobarbital (Tocris Bioscience). After the dorsal and lateral back hair was shaved, the rats were placed in a wooden mold with an 8&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;5&#x000a0;cm opening corresponding to 30% of the total body surface area.

All the animals were quickly dried and then resuscitated with Ringer&#x02019;s lactate solution (50&#x000a0;ml/kg b. w. i.p.). Subsequently, the rats received analgesia with buprenorphine (Tocris Bioscience) at a dose of 0.05&#x000a0;mg/kg b. w. (i.p.) every 8&#x000a0;h post-scald burn.</p><p id="Par10">Time course studies were performed to evaluate calpain activity and the&#x000a0;severity of lung injuries. The rats were sacrificed at 0.5, 1, 6, 12, and 24&#x000a0;h post-scald&#x000a0;burn, with six animals for each time point&#x000a0;respectively. For the sham group, six rats underwent identical procedures but were immersed in room temperature water. And then, the effects of the calpain inhibitor MDL28170 were evaluated. The rats were divided into the sham group, the sham with MDL28170 group, the burn injury group, and the burn injury with MDL28170 group,&#x000a0;with six animals for each group. For the last group, MDL28170 at a dosage of 1 or 3&#x000a0;mg/kg b. w. was given intravenously through the tail vein 1&#x000a0;h before the scald burn. The drug was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to a concentration of 50&#x000a0;mg/ml and brought up to a volume of 1&#x000a0;ml with saline. For the burn injury group, the same amount of dimethyl sulfoxide as that in the drug treatment group (15&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l diluted to 1&#x000a0;ml with saline) was injected. The treatment for the sham group and the following procedures for all the groups were the same as those for the first experiments. Examinations at 1&#x000a0;h post-scald burn were performed to compare the differences among groups. Moreover, to evaluate the effects of MDL28170 when given 1&#x000a0;h post-scald&#x000a0;burn, the animals were randomly allocated to the burn injury group and the burn injury with MDL28170 group. Each group had six animals, and identical procedures were implemented for scald burn injury and drug delivery.

In this study, we demonstrated that (1) scald burn induced acute lung injury that was accompanied with an increase in calpain activity; (2) calpain inhibition with MDL28170 ameliorated the acute lung injury in intact rats, as reflected by reduced histological scores, wet/dry weight ratios, and caspase-3 activity, an indicator of cell apoptosis; and (3) calpain inhibition reduced the proteolysis of membrane skeleton proteins &#x003b1;-fodrin and ankyrin-B, both of which are critical for cell structure and function. These data provided the first evidence that calpain is a mediator of acute lung injury after scald burn and suggested that its destructive action involves proteolysis of membrane skeleton proteins.</p><p id="Par26">Immunofluorescence images revealed calpain 1 and CD45 double-positive cells in the lungs of rats exposed to scald burn injury. These data provided evidence that leukocytes are a dominant source of calpain. As the calpain inhibitor MDL28170 gave no discernible protection against burn-induced skin damage in the epidermis and deep dermis structures, these results can be interpreted to support the view that acute lung injury is secondary to skin damage-induced inflammatory infiltration. Calpain is not only an intracellular constituent but is also released into the extracellular milieu. The latter behavior was implicated in regulation of tissue structure in acute glomerulonephritis via cleaving its substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Taking these findings into consideration, we suggest that severe scald burn elicits leukocyte infiltration, resulting in secretion of excessive calpain, consequently destroying the lung tissue structure.</p><p id="Par27">Membrane skeleton proteins take part in organizing epithelial cell shape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], assembling epithelial junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and tethering sodium channels to the apical membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], all of which affect the degree of epithelial fluid transport. In this study, time-course studies revealed that the degradation of membrane skeleton proteins &#x003b1;-fodrin and ankyrin-B correlated well with the degree of acute lung injury. Furthermore, calpain inhibition decreased levels of membrane skeleton protein fragments and wet/dry weight ratios. We suggest that calpain destroys alveolar epithelium via degrading membrane skeleton proteins, contributing to scald burn-induced acute lung injury.</p><p id="Par28">Calpain also plays a pivotal role in the inflammatory process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Here, the data showed that the calpain inhibitor MDL28170 decreased leukocyte infiltration, an important parameter for histological score. These results suggest that calpain enhances the inflammatory response in scald burn-induced lung injury. Currently, 15 calpain genes have been described in the human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. We only evaluated calpain 1 in this study, and the data revealed that it was involved in acute lung injury. Whether other isoforms also contribute to the injury warrants further investigation.</p><p id="Par29">Instant fluid resuscitation is a critical step to reduce multiorgan failure after scald burn. It protects patients from a decrease in circulating blood volume and cardiac output [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Furthermore, it prevents broad-spectrum protease inhibitor leupeptin-sensitive enzyme activation caused by delayed fluid resuscitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Here, we found that the activity of calpain was upregulated in the scenario of instant fluid resuscitation and that inhibition of calpain ameliorated the lung injury. We suggest that activation of calpain is an independent factor contributing to scald burn-induced lung injury.</p><p id="Par30">In this study, the calpain inhibitor MDL28170 had no discernible effects in normal rats, whereas the drug given before burn injury protected against scald burn-induced lung injury. These results suggest that calpain may be a promising candidate target in treatment of lung damage after burn injury. What is more important is that MDL28170 given at 1&#x000a0;h post-scald burn injury reduced lung wet/dry weight ratios compared with the burn group, although it had no obvious effects on histological score and caspase 3 activity. The data strongly support that calpain inhibition as early as possible is a potential strategy for ameliorating scald burn-induced lung injury.</p><p id="Par31">Last but not least, the data showed that calpain activity remained at high levels at 24&#x000a0;h post-scald burn injury, a different result from the alteration of its substrates &#x003b1;-fodrin and ankyrin-B. Our data were consistent with the findings of Merritt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], but not with those of Wong [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], supporting the viewpoint that continued high levels of calpain activity participate in the high energy expenditure response to burn injury in the late phase.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par32">This study is the first to provide evidence that calpain, a product of infiltrating leukocytes, is a mediator of scald burn-induced acute lung injury. Its destructive actions involve enhancement of inflammation and proteolysis of membrane skeleton proteins. Our data also support the notion that calpain has late effects in the lung after scald burn injury. Further studies on its effects and the underlying mechanisms would be helpful to assess its potential as a therapeutic target in ameliorating acute lung injury after scald burn.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par33">The study was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no: 81772070 and 31371181).

Electricity in animals was discovered in the eighteenth century. Electric fields activate multiple cellular signaling pathways such as PI3K/PTEN, the membrane channel of KCNJ15/Kir4.2 and intracellular polyamines. These pathways are involved in the sensing of physiological electric fields, directional cell migration (galvanotaxis, also known as electrotaxis), and possibly other cellular responses. Importantly, electric fields provide a dominant and over-riding signal that directs cell migration. Electrical stimulation could be a promising therapeutic method in promoting wound healing and activating regeneration of chronic and non-healing wounds. This review provides an update of the physiological role of electric fields, its cellular and molecular mechanisms, its potential therapeutic value, and questions that still await answers.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Wound healing</kwd><kwd>Ion transport</kwd><kwd>Endogenous electric fields</kwd><kwd>Electrical stimulation</kwd><kwd>Cell migration</kwd><kwd>Clinical trials</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Hefei University Special Talent Fund</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>NIH EY019101, and AFOSR-MURI grant FA9550-16-1-0052.</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par2">Luigi Galvani provided the first evidence for &#x0201c;animal electricity&#x0201d; in 1794, by demonstrating that muscles contracted when the cut end of a frog sciatic nerve from one leg touched the muscles of the opposite leg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].

Cell migration in an electric field was initially oversimplified and suggested to be due to the passive movements of charged particles. The passive movement hypothesis is now considered incomplete, as the electrotaxis direction does not always coincide with the direction of movement of charged macromolecules within cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. During electrotaxis, cells extend membrane protrusions and relocate membrane receptor proteins actively. Charged macromolecule receptors on the cell membrane such as the Con A receptor and epithelial growth factor receptors (EGFR) are found in an asymmetric distribution after electric field treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Electric fields elicit a stem cell regenerative response</title><p id="Par7">The effect of electric fields on cells in wounds extends beyond cell migration cues. Evidence of electric field-elicited stem cell regenerative responses are emerging. Electric fields affect stem cell differentiation, and electric fields are capable of powering stem cell regenerative potential. However, the biophysical mechanisms by which stem cells sense, interpret, and transform electrical cues into biochemical and biological signals remain unclear.</p><p id="Par8">Simple direct current pulsed treatment could control the fate of neural stem and progenitor cells (NPCs). Chang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] demonstrated that square wave&#x000a0;direct current pulses (magnitude 300&#x000a0;mV/mm at a frequency of 100&#x000a0;Hz) induced morphologic and phenotypic changes in mouse neural stem and progenitor cells, in stem cell maintenance medium.

Hammerick et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] reported murine adipose-derived stromal cells (mASCs) migrated toward the cathode in direct current fields of physiologic strength and exhibit dose-dependent migration. Electric fields also caused stromal cells to orient perpendicularly to the field vector, and electric fields elicited a transient increase in cytosolic calcium.</p><p id="Par10">Furthermore, Lluci&#x000e0;-Valldeperas et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] reported that the use of electric field-trained adipose tissue-derived progenitor is advisable for tissue regeneration (cardiac). The electric field-stimulated cells became better aligned to patterned surfaces, making cells more suitable for cardiac regeneration, compared to controls; electrically stimulated cells showed phenotypic changes: better alignment and perpendicular reorientation to the electric field. This was effective in cell suspension or within engineered tissue.</p><p id="Par11">Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been well established to play a key role in tissue regeneration and wound healing. Zimolag et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] found that the reaction of MSCs to electric field stimulation was very rapid, occurring within 1&#x000a0;min. Mesenchymal stem cells migrate toward the cathode, and interruption of PI3K and Arp2/3 had the most pronounced effect on electrotaxis in MSCs. On the other hand, macrophages, the other key player in wound healing, migrate toward the anode. However, macrophage electrotaxis is mostly dependent on Rho family&#x000a0;of small GTPases.</p><p id="Par12">Factors released by bone marrow (BM)-MSCs recruit macrophages and endothelial lineage cells into the wound, thus enhancing wound healing. BM-MSCs secrete distinctively different cytokines and chemokines: BM-MSC-conditioned medium significantly enhanced the migration of macrophages, keratinocytes, and endothelial cells and the proliferation of keratinocytes and endothelial cells.

Although details are still unfolding, discovery of the asymmetric distribution of membrane receptors to cathodal or anodal facing sides was pioneered by Poo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] who showed Con A receptor asymmetries after direct current electric field application. It has been reported that the EGFR&#x000a0;were redistributed asymmetrically after application of a direct current electric field, on both keratinocytes and corneal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This notion is further supported by recent evidence of the asymmetric distribution of activated downstream intracellular molecules of signaling cascades such as increased lamellipodial Ca<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> sparks, relocation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1, 2 (ERK1, 2), and pERK1, 2 (phosphorated ERK1, 2). [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]</p><p id="Par14">Using pharmacological and genetic approaches, two key signaling molecules were discovered to be required for electric field-induced migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Electric field activates the PI3K-AKT (phosphoinositide-3 kinase-AKT serine/threonine kinase) pathway, producing PIP3 (phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-bisphosphate) and activation of AKT (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), which induces asymmetric intracellular signaling cascades. AKT activation is critical for cellular responses following wounding, such as cell migration, survival, and proliferation. Genetic disruption of PI3K (p110), the catalytic subunit of PI3 kinase &#x003b3;, abolishes directed movements in epithelial healing. In contrast, deletion of the Pten (phosphatase and tensin homolog) gene, an antagonist of the PI3K-AKT pathway, enhances the PI3K-AKT signaling axis and enhances the electric field-induced cellular responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Through the use of green fluorescent proteins, the dynamics of PI3K activation induced by an applied electric field was visualized by AKT (Pleckstrin homology domain-green fluorescent protein) PH domain-GFP fusion protein in real time, as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Pleckstrin homology domain (PH domain) binds PtdIns (3,4)-P2 phosphoinositides; it marks the activation of PI3K and distribution of phosphoinositides. This demonstrates there are molecules which interact with external electric fields to direct cell migration.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>An applied electric field induces polarized activation of PI3K kinase. AKT PH domain-GFP fusion protein reports activation and polarization of PI3K kinase/AKT pathway in an HL-60 differentiated neutrophil-like cell in an electric field. The activation is at the leading edge, when the field polarity is reversed (at 170&#x000a0;s), the new activation site and leading edge form (at 440&#x000a0;s), and the cell moves in the opposite direction.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] screened a library of 381 genes encoding ion channels, pumps, and transporters using a siRNA knockdown strategy on a human corneal epithelial cell line (hTCEpi cells). The screening identified 35 genes that showed significant effects on galvanotaxis. In particular, knockdown of KCNJ15, a gene encoding the K<sup>+</sup> channel Kir4.2, completely abolished galvanotaxis while maintaining the normal migration speed, which was further verified on the HaCaT cell model, a spontaneously immortalized human keratinocyte line which migrates to the cathode, and on the MDA-MB-231 cell model, a human breast adenocarcinoma line which migrates to the anode. Genetic and pharmacological evidence revealed an interesting two-molecule model of K<sup>+</sup> channel/Kir4.2, and intracellular polyamines were proposed to be instrumental in external electric field polarity sensing. Initially, a weak extracellular electric field redistributes positively charged polyamines, which then bind to K<sup>+</sup> channel Kir4.2 and consequently regulate the flux of potassium ions. K<sup>+</sup> channel Kir4.2 activity alteration induced local changes in membrane potential, osmolality, and the ionic environment. It consequently interacts with the previously established intracellular PI3K/AKT pathways and ultimately affects actin polymerization, membrane protrusion, and cell migration. Nevertheless, this new two-molecule model hypothesis is not an exhaustive account; other mechanisms such as the potassium transporter Trk1p, sodium channel ENaC, calcium channels, and integrin molecules have also been shown to be required for electric field sensing in yeast and in keratinocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Electrical stimulation is likely to affect mammalian cells and yeast through the same or similar mechanisms, yet these responses are likely to be cell-type specific and stimulation parameter-dependent. For example, there are reciprocal interactions between lipid rafts and integrin, which are necessary for direct current-induced polarization of intracellular signaling molecules, while in AC fields, polarization is frequency-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Microenvironmental factors such as hypoxic preconditioning can accelerate electric field-guided directional migration of keratinocytes; this effect was both oxygen tension- and preconditioning time-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Furthermore, in Dictyostelium, PI3Ks and cGMP mediate cathode-directed signaling and migration can be switched between cathode-directed and anode-directed signaling through intracellular cGMP levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

More detailed analysis reviewed by Houghton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] concluded that not all forms of electrical stimulation produce beneficial results; only studies using certain electrical stimulation protocols such as monophasic pulsed current applied to the wound and biphasic pulsed current that is applied for 2&#x000a0;h daily to periulcer skin at intensities which produce motor responses have consistently demonstrated positive results.</p><p id="Par22">Despite the fact that the clinical research designs were not comparable in most studies, Kloth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] reviewed six clinical studies and found that electrical energy is a useful indicator and the total charge dosage range of 250&#x02013;500&#x000a0;&#x00173; Coulomb/s represents a small window of electrical energy that has been shown to produce favorable wound healing results.

In this review, only three newly added electrical stimulation devices are discussed.</p><p id="Par27">POSiFECT&#x000ae; wound dressing product is a disposable bioelectric device [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. It contains a miniature electric circuit that delivers a direct current microamperage current to the wound. The anode is a flexible metal ring embedded into hydrogel in the dressing, and the cathode is a dime-sized electrode embedded in hydrogel that is applied directly to the wound bed. The current comes from two built-in lithium batteries. Clegg and Guest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] showed that POSiFECT&#x000ae; RD bioelectric wound dressing is effective for activating chronic wound healing.</p><p id="Par28">Another electric dressing product is Procellera&#x02122;. The dry dressing Procellera&#x02122; is electrically inactive, and its batteries are claimed to be activated when moistened with wound exudate or by saline. The manufacturer claims that it is able to generate a sustained voltage (2&#x02013;10&#x000a0;mV) for up to 7&#x000a0;days on the wound surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">However, applying electrical stimulation to wounds remains a technical challenge as direct contact of the electrode with the wound bed causes pain and risks infection. To overcome this, developing a device that allows delivery of electrical stimulation without direct skin contact would be ideal. Wirsing et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] reported a new non-invasive, electrical stimulation device, which transfers a 1.5-&#x003bc;A current to any surface wound from a distance, using oxygen&#x02019;s and nitrogen&#x02019;s ability to exchange electrons. After treatment twice or three times per week for 45&#x02013;60&#x000a0;min per session, the wireless micro-current stimulation treatment significantly accelerated wound healing for patients with chronic wounds of different etiologies. It has proved to be an easy-to-use, non-invasive, time-efficient treatment.</p><p id="Par30">A major caveat is that, in most clinical study settings, no device has been approved by the FDA for promotion of wound healing. While electrical stimulation devices such as Procellera&#x02122; has been used on patients with partial-thickness wounds, full-thickness wounds, pressure ulcers, venous ulcers, and diabetic ulcers in studies, the FDA has only approved Procellera&#x02122; for anti-infection use.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Limitations in the utilization of electrical stimulation</title><p id="Par31">Recent systematic reviews provide positive recommendation regarding the effectiveness of electrical stimulation to increase wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. However, most devices are electrode-based and need skin contact to establish the electric circuit. Application on the wound risks infection and skin irritation. Minimizing the interruption to the wound bed and the wound healing process remains technically challenging.</p><p id="Par32">Electrical stimulation parameters for specific wound condition (diabetic chronic wounds, pressure sore wounds, and simple wounds) remain to be optimized. A common issue in reported electrical stimulation investigations is that of limited sample sizes. Industry-sponsored phase III clinical trials can remedy this. In addition, many case studies looked at percentage change in wound area as the primary outcome rather than complete delayed wound healing, which normally happens at 12 to 20&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p id="Par33">Electrical stimulation duration remains controversial. Under experimental settings, in vitro endothelial cell orientation was seen as early as 4&#x000a0;h after the application of an electric field with 100&#x000a0;mV/mm. In clinical settings, patients are treated with a regimen of 20&#x000a0;min of stimulation per session; such treatment regimens remain to be evaluated.</p><p id="Par34">Unlike in vitro electrical stimulation studies, where electric fields and currents can be monitored precisely, in clinical settings, measuring the induced electric field and currents in wounds is technically challenging. Consequently, in most clinical studies, there is a lack of verification of directly measured electric fields and currents in the wounds on patients. So caution should be taken when interpreting clinical results.</p><p id="Par35">Overall, electrical stimulation treatments are relatively safe. No major adverse events have been reported, although minor skin irritation is associated with continuous direct current or pulsed direct current between 50 and 1000&#x000a0;&#x003bc;A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">It is intriguing that at the single-cell level, the anode and cathode has different effects on cells&#x02014;the polarity of the treatment electrode is important in managing chronic wounds in vivo. However, a recent review indicates that electrical stimulation improves wound blood flow and leads to wound size reduction in patients regardless of the polarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par37">Endogenous electric fields at wounds may play a major role in wound healing and regenerative processes, with possible mechanisms involving regulation of cell migration, cell differentiation, and tissue growth. Functional characterization of endogenous electric fields in mammalian development and wound healing has produced some significant insights. Major gaps in knowledge remain, on which electrical stimulation therapies ultimately depend. Electrical stimulation offers a unique treatment option to chronic and non-healing wounds. Greater understanding of the mechanisms will bring us closer to effective clinical applications. Additional experimental and clinical research are needed to elucidate how wound regeneration is affected by the selection of electric polarity and how this may affect the overall healing response. It is also imperative to determine the standardization of electrical stimulation across diverse devices, including the regimens and optimal parameters (polarity, current amplitude, frequency, and duration) in each clinical condition.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par38">Work in Zhao Lab is supported by NIH EY019101,and AFOSR-MURI grant FA9550-16-1-0052 and Tai Lab is&#x000a0;supported by the Hefei University Special Talent Fund.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par39">Data sharing is not applicable to this article as no datasets were generated.</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>GT, MT, and MZ contributed to the peer-reviewing and writing of the manuscript.

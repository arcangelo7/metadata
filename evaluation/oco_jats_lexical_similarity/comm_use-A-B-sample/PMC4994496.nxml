We have examined here the wound healing properties of honey on human fibroblasts, using an <italic>in vitro</italic> scratch wound healing model. Three kinds of widely used monofloral honeys were used, viz. acacia (<italic>Robinia pseudacacia</italic>), buckwheat (<italic>Fagopyrum sp.</italic>), and manuka (<italic>Leptospermum scoparium</italic>). Data displayed an increased wound healing activity in fibroblasts, but with different efficiency and mechanisms of action among honeys. The effects of acacia and buckwheat emerged in both scratch wound and chemotaxis assays, while the effect of manuka was significant but lower. The use of inhibitors indicated on the whole an essential role of cytosolic calcium, an important role of ERK and p38, and a secondary role of PI3K. Acacia and buckwheat, but not manuka, induced significant increases in the release of interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-6, and IL-8, indicating a correlation between interleukin upregulation and wound closure efficiency. This is consistent with our previous findings suggesting a higher ability of acacia and buckwheat to activate keratinocyte reepithelialization, with respect to manuka honey. In conclusion, our data indicate that acacia and buckwheat honeys are particularly efficient in facilitating fibroblast wound closure activities, suggesting new therapeutic possibilities for this natural product.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Key words</title><kwd>Honey</kwd><kwd>wound healing</kwd><kwd>interleukins</kwd><kwd>dermal fibroblast</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2013</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Honey has a long and interesting history. Since Biblical times and before, it has been known to have beneficial health effects, and is still widely used in &#x02018;folk medicine&#x02019;. Recently, the therapeutic virtues of honey have been rediscovered by the medical profession and are gaining acceptance for treating ulcers, wounds and other surface infections. Literature reports show that honey has been successfully used on infections not responding to standard antiseptic and antibiotic therapy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]<table-wrap id="Taba"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="2">Access this article online</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2"><bold>Quick Response Code</bold>: <inline-graphic xlink:href="41038_2013_10010032_Figa.gif" id="d30e228"/></td><td><bold>Website</bold>: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.burnstrauma.com">www.burnstrauma.com</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td><bold>DOI</bold>: 10.4103/2321-3868.113333</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>In spite of an increasing diffusion of honey for clinical uses, the subjacent mechanisms of action are still largely obscure. However, it has been already shown that the usefulness of honey in treating wounds is not limited to its antibacterial action. For instance, honey promotes rapid growth of healthy granulation tissue and acts as an anti-inflammatory agent.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] Zumla <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] briefly reviewed the use of honey for therapeutic purposes, and from the widespread reports of clinical uses, they concluded that it was time for honey to receive due recognition by the medical world.</p><p>Wound healing is a complex process entailing several interactions among cells, the extracellular matrix, and factors involved in inflammatory responses and vascular repair.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] The process is generally divided into three parts, known as inflammatory, proliferation and maturation phases.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] The inflammatory phase, usually lasting up to 4 days, is dominated by platelet accumulation at the wounded sites, followed by immune cell migration into the wound, especially neutrophils and macrophages. The proliferative phase is characterized by the arrival and proliferation of fibroblasts that synthesize a provisional collagen type III matrix (granulation tissue) and differentiate into myofibroblasts allowing wound contraction. During this phase, keratinocytes also migrate from wound edges and reform the upper epidermis. The maturation phase involves the remodeling of collagen from type III to type I, operated by fibroblasts, in association with the apoptosis of myofibroblasts, endothelial cells and macrophages. This phase can last in some cases for one year or longer.</p><p>Honey is increasingly used as a wound dressing in clinical settings,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] but the relationships between its healing properties and the wound repair mechanism are still largely unexplored.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the potential wound healing effects of honey on fibroblasts.

Cells were then fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, and then stained with 0.1% toluidine blue at room temperature for 30 min. The width of the wound space was measured at wounding and at the end of treatments, using an inverted microscope equipped with a digital camera (Leica Microsystems). Digitized pictures of wounds were analyzed using the NIH Image J software. In a typical experiment, each group consisted of three different plates, i.e. a total of six wounds.

MMPs and TIMPs are known to control the inflammatory phase of wound healing by modulating chemokine and cytokine cleavage, while they also regulate matrix degradation and remodeling.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] Majtan <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and Ranzato <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] have consistently demonstrated that honey exposure induces gelatinase MMP-9 expression in human keratinocytes, thus confirming a similar effect obtained on the same cells with the platelet lysate.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] In contrast, the platelet lysate does not seem to affect gelatinase expression in fibroblasts.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] This is another point of convergence with the present investigation, where MMP or TIMP upregulation by honey was limited to MMP-3 induction with manuka, and TIMP-1 with manuka and buckwheat. The increase of TIMP-1 upon buckwheat exposure could be linked to the anti-inflammatory effects of this protein, considering that it has been induced by cytokine exposure in dermal fibroblasts.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]</p><p>Cytokines are known to play a role in wound healing, and accordingly, our data provide a close correlation between interleukin modulation and wound healing activity. Acacia and buckwheat honeys, which were most active in promoting scratch wound closure, also induced significant increases of primary interleukins present in our fibroblast culture, viz. IL-4, IL-6, and IL-8. The involvement of all these factors in wound healing has been previously documented.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]</p><p>Hence, different kinds of evidence indicate that acacia and buckwheat honeys are more efficient than manuka honey in promoting the tissue repair activity of fibroblasts. Most notably, these data are consistent with our previous findings, suggesting a higher ability of acacia and buckwheat to activate keratinocyte re-epithelialization.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]</p><p>In summary, our present and previous findings consistently indicate that honey is generally active in facilitating wound closure, thus confirming a bulk of anecdotal and scientific evidence. However, the novelty of our data consists in showing that different types of honey act with different mechanisms, and moreover that some of these mechanisms are more efficient than others. In particular, acacia and buckwheat honeys have shown more powerful wound-healing promoting activities with respect to manuka honey on both dermal and epidermal cells. Hence, our data indicate that the complex of different honey types offers a wider set of therapeutic possibilities, raising new medical interest in this valuable natural product.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Ranzato E, Martinotti S, Burlando B.

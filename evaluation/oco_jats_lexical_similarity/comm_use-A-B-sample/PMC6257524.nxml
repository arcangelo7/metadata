patients undergoing cardiac surgery, making it one of the most common complications
observed in this group of patients<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. In a study conducted by Kochi et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>, the prevalence of postoperative
AKI among cardiac surgery patients was 34.0%. In contrast, Santos et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>, Chertow et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> and Conlon et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>, reported rates of only 16.1%,
2.4%, and 1.1%, respectively. The considerable variation in the reported incidence
and prevalence of AKI as a postoperative complication of cardiac surgery is due to
differences in the diagnostic criteria adopted, as well as in study design,
inclusion/exclusion criteria, patient profiles, and the type/number of treatment
facilities involved<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Evidence suggests that even slight postoperative increases in serum creatinine levels
are associated with a significant increase in the risk of death<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>. Among individuals undergoing
cardiac surgery, mortality has been reported to be as high as 8% and postoperative
AKI can increase the mortality rate to over 60%<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>. The occurrence of AKI in patients undergoing cardiac
surgery raises the mortality rate from 0.4-4.4% to 1.3-22.3%; when those same
patients require dialysis, rates range from 25% to 88.9%, making severe
postoperative AKI an independent risk factor for mortality that results in an 8-fold
increase in the risk of death<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>. Therefore, cardiac surgery AKI is
associated with serious complications as well as with prolonged intensive care unit
(ICU) stays and with a worse quality of life. It also increases early and late
mortality and health care expenditures<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The early identification of patients at risk of developing AKI after cardiac surgery
is an important strategy for improving the care of such patients during the
intraoperative and postoperative periods. The following factors have been found to
facilitate the development of AKI after cardiac surgery: age; obesity; female
gender; valve replacement surgery; myocardial infarction in the last 30 days; low
cardiac output; blood transfusion; prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB); the use
of inotropic or vasoconstrictor drugs; the use of an intra-aortic balloon pump;
diabetes mellitus; heart failure; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD);
peripheral artery disease; systemic arterial hypertension; and chronic kidney
disease<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Epidemiological studies of AKI in cardiac surgery patients are important because they
allow for better diagnosis of AKI and facilitate the prognosis estimation, as well
as the development of new, more effective strategies to prevent and minimize this
complication, thus reducing the associated morbidity and mortality<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>. Therefore, the objective of this
study was to identify the risk factors for AKI in cardiac surgery patients without
chronic kidney disease, as well as to assess the impact of AKI on the early
mortality and survival of such patients, at a single cardiology center in the
Southeastern region of Brazil.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Study Population</title><p>This was a retrospective study of patients between 20 and 80 years of age who
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), valve replacement (single or
multiple), or both (simultaneously), between January 2008 and January 2014. All
the procedures had been performed at a tertiary care cardiology hospital that
serves the public and private sector in the macro-region of Alto
Parana&#x000ed;ba, in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais.</p></sec><sec><title>Exclusion Criteria</title><p>Patients who underwent cardiac surgery for congenital heart disease and emergency
heart surgery were excluded. We also excluded patients who, within the last 72
hours before surgery, were injected with iodinated contrast (because of its
potential nephrotoxicity), as well as those with a preoperative creatinine
clearance &#x0003c; 60 mL/min (as calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation) and
those who died within the first 24 hours after surgery. There was only one
patient undergoing CABG surgery without CPB, so this case was excluded.</p><p>We reviewed the medical records of 195 patients who underwent cardiac surgery
during the studied period. Of those 195 records, 51 were incomplete. Therefore,
the final sample comprised 144 medical records. In the process of constructing
the multivariate analysis (logistic regression) models, it was necessary to
exclude two cases, because they were considered outliers in practically all
analyses. Thus, the final analysis comprised 142 medical records. After
analyzing the medical records, we contacted all individuals or the relatives by
telephone, in order to obtain information about subsequent survival or
mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Variables Studied</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>For the preoperative period, we evaluated physical characteristics
(gender, age, weight, and height), biochemical characteristics
(prior complete blood count and baseline serum creatinine), and
comorbidities (arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary
heart disease, and COPD), as well as the history of stroke, coronary
artery disease, and cardiac surgery;</p></list-item><list-item><p>For the perioperative period, we evaluated the type of surgery
performed (CABG, valve replacement, or the combination of the two),
the duration of CPB, the need for transfusion of blood products, and
the use of vasoactive drugs (norepinephrine or dobutamine);</p></list-item><list-item><p>For the postoperative period, we evaluated the results of the
complete blood counts, serum creatinine, and serum urea&#x02014;on
postoperative days 1 and 2, as well as on the day of hospital
discharge. We also evaluated mean arterial pressure (MAP), diuresis,
and fluid balance on postoperative days 1 and 2, as recorded on
forms filled out daily by the nursing staff;</p></list-item><list-item><p>The need for blood transfusion, the use of vasoactive drugs
(norepinephrine or dobutamine), the administration of diuretics, and
the need for hemodialysis were evaluated;</p></list-item><list-item><p>We noted the length of the ICU stay (in days) and whether the patient
died or was discharged.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec><title>Definition of Terms</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>AKI was defined according to the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN)
classification, using serum creatinine and urine output as criteria
for the evaluation of renal function. The AKIN classifies patients

creatinine or urine output over a 48-hour period. Patients who
require hemodialysis are classified as AKIN stage 3<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>;</p></list-item><list-item><p>The preoperative period was defined as the time from the scheduling

package, version 22.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). The statistical
analysis was carried out in two stages.</p><p>Continuous variables were compared with the Student's t-test, and categorical
variables were compared with the chi-square test. Once these variables had been
listed, multiple logistic regression was used in order to examine the influence
of all variables simultaneously and their relation to the occurrence of AKI. In
the process of constructing the multivariate analysis (logistic regression)
models, it was necessary to exclude two cases, because they were considered
outliers in practically all analyses. Therefore, the final analysis comprised
142 medical records.</p><p>In the second stage, we evaluated the impact of AKI on mortality and survival. We
used the chi-square test to evaluate the impact of AKI on mortality and the
Mantel-Haenszel method (common odds ratio) to evaluate the probability of death
due to AKI in the postoperative period. Subsequently, the Kaplan-Meier method
was applied to compare the patients who developed AKI after cardiac surgery with
those who did not, in terms of survival, and Cox regression was used to
determine if there were other variables that directly affected survival. The
outcome measure (mortality) was evaluated for a maximum of 3 years after cardiac
surgery. Values of <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 were considered statistically
significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Descriptive Analysis</title><p>In the sample (n=142), the mean age was 58.28&#x000b1;13.87 years, the mean body

(56.66%) of those deaths occurring in the first 30 days after cardiac surgery.
Early and late mortality were higher among the patients with AKI than among
those without, early mortality occurring in 15 and 2 of the patients,
respectively (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.04) and late mortality (death occurring
&#x02265; 31 days after surgery) in 10 and 3 of the patients, respectively
(<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.04). The odds ratio estimation test showed that the
risk of death was 2.5 times higher in the patients who developed AKI after
cardiac surgery than in those who did not (OR=2.5, 95% CI=1.06-6.00,

demonstrated that in the first 30 days after surgery, individuals without AKI
had a higher probability of survival, which persisted throughout the three-year
follow-up period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). The analysis
of the risk of death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>)
corroborated those findings, showing that individuals with AKI were more likely
to die after cardiac surgery, either within the first 30 days after surgery or

43.66%, much higher than the 16.4% and 15.7% reported by Andersson et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> and Kumada et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>, respectively. That discrepancy
could be attributed to the different definitions of AKI employed, variations in the
methodologies, as well as in the patient profiles, and differences among the types
of treatment facilities<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>. Our multivariate analysis showed
that advanced age, valve replacement surgery, vasoactive drug use in the
postoperative period, and having previously undergone cardiac surgery were the
factors most strongly related to the development of AKI in a population from which
patients with a creatinine clearance &#x0003c; 60 ml/min were excluded.</p><p>A progressive increase in the incidence of AKI among elderly patients has been
reported in several studies<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>. According to Magro et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>, that can be
explained by the fact that the patients currently undergoing cardiac surgery are
older and more critically ill than were those undergoing cardiac surgery in the
past. Therefore, such patients have a worse prognosis and their recovery is delayed.
Santos et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> found that being
over 63 years of age is an independent risk factor for AKI. The loss of the renal
functional reserve caused by the progressive reduction of the glomerular filtration
rate with advancing age makes such patients more susceptible to renal damage when
exposed to hypoperfusion<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Our multivariate analysis demonstrated that patients undergoing surgery for valve
replacement are at a greater risk of developing AKI than are those undergoing other
types of cardiac surgery. Rodrigues et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> reported similar findings which can be explained by the
fact that valve replacements are more complex procedures, with longer surgical
times, which could have a direct effect on hemodynamic stability and on renal
perfusion<sup>[<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup>. The idea of
hemodynamic instability as the cause of AKI in valve replacement surgery was
suggested in our study because dobutamine use in the postoperative period was found
to be more common in valve replacements than in the other surgical procedures
evaluated.</p><p>Our multivariate analysis showed that the patients who had previously undergone
cardiac surgery were at a greater risk of developing AKI after a second cardiac
surgery. In a study of 3,500 patients submitted to cardiac surgery, Karkouti et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> demonstrated that
surgical re-exploration is associated with a number of negative outcomes, including
AKI. However, the mechanisms involved have not been well elucidated.</p><p>In our sample, the postoperative use of amines (norepinephrine and dobutamine) was
found to predispose to the development of AKI. Pontes et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>, Lopez-Delgado et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>, and Santos et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> also demonstrated that the use of
inotropic drugs in the postoperative period was a determining factor for the
development of AKI. This is likely associated with the mechanisms of renal ischemia
and reperfusion caused by poor cardiac performance and hemodynamic
instability<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Although several studies have shown that prolonged CPB is a major risk factor for
AKI<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>, that variable was found to be of little
importance in our study, probably because the mean duration of CPB was quite short.
Some studies<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> have
shown that blood transfusion during the perioperative period increases the
likelihood that AKI will occur after cardiac surgery. However, in the present study,
perioperative blood transfusion was shown to be mildly renoprotective, regardless of
the type of blood products used. We can hypothesize that the perioperative
transfusion of blood products improved the hemodynamic status of the patients in our
sample and was therefore protective against AKI.</p><p>In the present study, AKI had a negative impact on patient survival, an effect that
was more pronounced in the more advanced AKIN stages and in patients requiring
hemodialysis. Various studies have shown that the development of AKI after cardiac
surgery increases mortality, especially in patients who require dialysis<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup>. In a study involving 3,240 patients undergoing
cardiac surgery, Hobson et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup>
also analyzed survival rates in those who developed AKI in the postoperative period,
reporting that one-year and five-year survival rates were lower for the patients who
developed AKI (89% and 44%, respectively) than for those who did not (95% and 63%,
respectively). Loef et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup>
corroborated those findings in a cohort of 843 patients who underwent cardiac
surgery and were followed for 100 months thereafter. The authors found that, during
the follow-up period, mortality was significantly higher in patients with
postoperative deterioration of renal function and that survival remained lower
regardless of whether there was recovery of renal function after hospital discharge.
The mechanisms involved in this process are not fully understood, because AKI can be
an early sign that other systems and organs are also negatively affected, and the
sum of those dysfunctions could contribute to and explain the higher mortality and
lower survival among individuals developing AKI after cardiac surgery.</p><p>However, our study has certain limitations: It is a retrospective study. In addition,
the size of the patient sample was small, along with the fact that all the surgical
procedures were performed at a single center, which could have limited the
statistical power of the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In the present study, we have shown that the occurrence of AKI after cardiac surgery
had a negative influence on mortality and survival of the affected patients. Like
other authors, we found that age, valve replacement, a history of cardiac surgery,
and the use of vasoactive drugs in the postoperative period were independent
predictors of the development of AKI after cardiac surgery in a population of
patients with near-normal renal function. Thus, our findings underscore the
importance of identifying risk factors for the development of AKI after cardiac
surgery, which can further the development of effective renoprotective
strategies.</p><table-wrap id="t6" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="50%" span="1"/><col width="50%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">KAR</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Substantial contributions to the conception or design

Supervised outpatient exercise programs have been shown to improve outcomes following burn injury. However, little is known about the exercise behaviors of burn survivors who do not undertake such programs. This study aimed to investigate self-reported exercise behaviors and barriers to exercise in adult burn survivors. A short questionnaire survey was conducted on adult burn survivors attending the ambulatory burns clinic of a tertiary hospital over a 6-week period. The collected data were subjected to paired <italic>t</italic>-tests and Pearson&#x02019;s correlation test. A total of 63 adult burn survivors (mean age 36.5 years) completed the questionnaire. Participants reported exercising less frequently and engaged in fewer different types of exercise compared with pre-burn (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Poor physical conditions and low motivation and enthusiasm were the major barriers to exercise. Participation in supervised exercise programs can be limited by a range of factors including the availability of resources and access to facilities. This preliminary study suggests that there is a need to improve compliance with outpatient exercise programs. Burn survivors appear to exercise less frequently after burn injury. Barriers to exercise following burn injury include poor physical condition and reduced motivation. Further investigation into overall physical activity following burn injury and potential physical and psychological limitations is warranted. Burn clinicians should highly encourage injury survivors to participate in supervised exercise programs when available or to do exercises at home to maximize post-burn injury recovery.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Key words</title><kwd>Burns</kwd><kwd>exercise behaviors</kwd><kwd>survey</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2013</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>As burn injury-associated mortality rate has been consistently decreasing over recent decades,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] reducing burn-related morbidity constitutes an increasingly significant challenge to burn care clinicians and researchers. The process of recovery following burn injury is often lengthy and complex. Common sequelae include scarring, wound breakdown, pain, contractures, joint stiffness, and physical deconditioning. Physical deconditioning is characterized by reductions in lean body mass and aerobic capacity and is associated with deleterious effects on wound healing, infection risk, morbidity, and physical function.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] The two major causes of physical deconditioning following severe burn injury are muscle catabolism and bed rest.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] Physical condition and function are important outcome measures following burn injury, and it has been previously demonstrated that the functional independence measure (FIM) score for locomotion is the single most important determinant of discharge destination.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]<table-wrap id="Taba"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="2">Access this article online</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2">

At present, little is known about the exercise behaviors of burn survivors who do not undertake supervised exercise programs. The term &#x0201c;exercise&#x0201d; denotes physical activity for the purpose of health or fitness, and &#x0201c;behavior&#x0201d; refers to the behavioral patterns related to a particular act.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] Hence, the term &#x0201c;exercise behaviors&#x0201d; describes the behavioral patterns relating to physical activity undertaken for fitness. Given the role of exercise in improving outcomes following burn injury, the evaluation of exercise behaviors and barriers to exercise is warranted. The aims of this study were: (1) To investigate self-reported exercise behaviors in adult burn survivors and comparing participation in exercise prior to and after injury and (2) to identify perceived barriers to exercise following burn injury.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>Adult burn survivors who attended the Ambulatory Burns Clinic at the Concord Hospital, Sydney, Australia during the 6 week&#x02019;s study period were considered potential participants.

Current American College of Sports Medicine guidelines for exercise recommend that individuals undertake moderate physical activity for 30 min on most days of the week to obtain health benefits.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] In burn rehabilitation, guidelines for outpatient exercise programs are based on previous literature, advocating a combination of strength and aerobic exercise on three occasions per week in addition to daily stretching exercises and regular activities.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] In this study, participants reported an exercise frequency of less than several times per week following their injury, which is below that of the recommendations for both healthy individuals and burn survivors. Burn survivors in this study therefore may not be engaging in sufficient exercise to gain the known benefits.</p><p>In this study, the severity of the initial injury was not correlated with exercise behaviors. No correlation was found between burn TBSA or hospital LOS and exercise frequency, and the presence of hand or leg burns had no impact on the change in exercise behaviors. However, poor physical condition was found to be a significant barrier to exercise following burn injury. It appears that perceived physical condition may be influenced by physical or psychological factors other than the initial injury, although information regarding actual physical condition was not collected. It is possible that comorbidities, pain, social supports, prior life experience, and previous physical condition may influence the individual&#x02019;s perception of their condition. Physical data were not collected in this study and are a direction for future research investigating the impact of physical and psychological factors on exercise performance.</p><p>The outpatient exercise protocol at the authors&#x02019; institution consists of exercise prescription for individualized, home-based exercise programs. Active range of motion is emphasized as this has been identified as the best exercise for joints affected by burns.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] Upon discharge from the hospital, individuals are given education regarding the importance of exercise following burn injury and are prescribed a home exercise program in which they practice with the therapist prior to discharge. Home exercise programs comprise daily active range of motion and stretching exercises, as well as three sessions each of aerobic exercise and strength training per week. The type of exercise prescribed varies depending on individual needs, but examples of common aerobic exercise include walking, cycling, and jogging. Individuals living locally are followed-up at the hospital clinic once to three times per week for therapist-assisted range of motion exercises and to progress their home program. Individuals living out of Sydney are referred to their local physiotherapist or exercise professional. Due to limited resources, outpatients do not undertake supervised strengthening or aerobic exercise at the hospital clinic. From the results of this study, burn survivors may not have received adequate exercise prescription and education upon discharge from hospital or may not have been adequately followed-up in the outpatient setting. The role of health professionals in prescribing, monitoring, and progressing individual exercise programs, particularly when supervised exercise is not undertaken, is emphasized.</p><p>There are several limitations to this study. The questionnaire used was developed for a quality improvement project and has not been evaluated for validity or reliability. There are several shortcomings within the questionnaire, for example the reliance on the recall of exercise behaviors prior to and following burn injury, as well as the use of self-reported information. The assessment of physical activity by self-report has been shown to overestimate actual exercise levels,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and the recall of exercise behaviors prior to burn injury in cases of greater than several elapsed years is questionable. For this reason, only those participants injured within the past 3 years were included in the data analysis. Additionally, no data were collected regarding the duration or intensity of exercise; these are important to consider when assessing exercise behaviors. The different types of exercise were not clearly defined, possibly resulting in exercise misreporting. For example, the term &#x0201c;stretching exercise&#x0201d; was intended to incorporate stretches and range of motion exercises; however, this may not have been apparent to the participant. Furthermore, the questionnaire examined formal exercise only and did not assess other components of physical activity such as incidental, occupational, domestic, or transport-related physical activity. There are several standardized questionnaires available for assessing self-reported overall physical activity, for example the International Physical Activity Questionnaire[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] or the Seven-Day Physical Activity Recall.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] Finally, many factors potentially influencing participation in exercise following burn injury were not investigated, for example pre-morbid physical or psychological conditions and the physical and psychological changes associated with burn injury. These factors are important considerations for both clinicians and researchers. Findings from this preliminary study highlight the importance of initiating and monitoring individual exercise programs and inform possible future directions for research.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This preliminary study found that adult burn survivors exercised less frequently and engaged in fewer types of exercise following their burn.

Cardiac myxomas represent
30-50% of all benign tumours. About 75% originating from the left atrium and 15-20%
from the right atrium, near the interatrial septum at fossa ovalis, and occur in all
age groups. If left untreated, they progressively enlarge and are potentially
fatal<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. We herein report a patient with left atrial mass
attached to posterior wall of left atrium, who underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting four years ago with patent coronary artery bypass grafts.</p></sec><sec><title>CASE REPORT</title><p>A 60-year-old man was admitted with complaints of dyspnea grade II and single episode
of syncope. The patient previously underwent coronary artery bypass grafting four
years ago. On investigation, chest X-ray and electrocardiogram were unremarkable.
Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed large (4.20 x 3.50 cm), mobile and
pedunculated mass attached to posterior wall of left atrium with no obstruction of
mitral valve orifice. Biventricular function on echocardiography appeared normal,
with no other significant pathology. Computed tomography scan confirmed presence of
large, lobulated and hypodense mass in left atrium, measuring approximately 4.00 x
3.50 cm attached to posterior wall. Coronary artery bypass grafts were patent
without any evidence of stenosis or occlusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure
1</xref>).</p><p>

</p><p>Patient underwent reoperation through right anterolateral thoracotomy in
4<sup>th</sup> intercostal space. Cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted through
femoro-femoral cannulation. Temperature was lowered down to 22&#x000ba;C and heart was
fibrillated. Left atrium was opened without aortic cross-clamp and mass resected
<italic>in toto</italic>. Post-resection thorough saline wash given and
posterior wall cauterized to prevent recurrence. Left atrium closed in two layers.
Patient was successfully weaned off from cardiopulmonary bypass. Total fibrillatory
arrest time was 25 minutes and cardiopulmonary bypass time was 95 minutes.
Histopathological examination of the mass confirmed the diagnosis of myxoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). We continued with follow-up of the
patient by echocardiography right after surgical treatment, as well as after 3
months and after 6 months, with no signs of tumor recurrence.</p><p>

</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Left atrial myxoma developing late following coronary artery bypass grafting with
patent coronary grafts have not been frequently reported in literature. Yavuz et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> reported resection
of left atrial myxoma with concomitant redo coronary artery bypass grafting through
median sternotomy approach. In their case, the patient underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting eleven years ago. Kollias et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> reported resection of right atrial appendage myxoma through
median sternotomy with patent coronary grafts following urgent coronary artery
bypass grafting six months ago due to left main disease. Mishra et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>, in their large single-centre
experience with intracardiac myxomas, studied the clinical presentation and
recurrence rate of cardiac myxomas and reported successful resection of intracardiac
myxomas through median sternotomy approach. In their study, occurrence of
intracardiac myxoma following coronary artery bypass grafting was not
reported<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. The
association of coronary artery disease with left atrial myxoma has been reported
earlier, but development of left atrial myxoma after coronary artery bypass grafting
with patent coronary grafts is a rare entity.</p><p>In our case, the patient had undergone coronary artery bypass grafting using left
internal mammary artery graft to left anterior descending. Left radial artery to
obtuse marginal branch and saphenous vein graft to posterior left ventricular branch
of right coronary artery through median sternotomy. Left atrial mass was detected by
two-dimensional echocardiography and transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE).
Preoperative computed tomographic angiography scan was performed to confirm the
diagnosis and evaluate graft patency. On computed tomographic angiography scan all
the coronary grafts were flowing well. Right coronary artery graft was lying
retrosternally in right atrioventricular groove making it prone for injury during
sternotomy. We preferred minimally invasive right thoracotomy approach over routine
median sternotomy to avoid graft injury and extensive dissections due to presence of
patent grafts. Fibrillatory arrest avoids the need for aortic cross-clamping and
cooling allows flow reduction for brief periods intermittently. Following surgery,
histopathology of the mass confirmed myxoma.</p><p>The surgical approach of left atrial myxoma with previous coronary artery bypass
grafting is an important issue from the viewpoint of preventing injury to patent
coronary grafts, intraoperative embolization of myxoma and myocardial protection.
All patients must undergo computed tomographic angiography scan to look for graft
patency. Patients with patent coronary grafts should undergo minimally
invasive/right thoracotomy approach whereas in cases where coronary grafts are not
patent then median sternotomy with concomitant coronary bypass grafting and
resection of myxoma should be performed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, occurrence of left atrial myxoma following coronary artery bypass
grafting is a rare entity. Resection of the same with patent grafts can be safely
tackled by minimally invasive approach under fibrillatory arrest with good
outcome.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="50%" span="1"/><col width="50%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">KP</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Substantial contributions to the conception or design

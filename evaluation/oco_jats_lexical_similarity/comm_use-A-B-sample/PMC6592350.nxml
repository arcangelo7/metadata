Four main themes emerged around the goal-setting process: patient preparedness and engagement; eliciting and legitimising goals; collaborative action planning; and GP engagement. GPs were unanimously positive about their experience of goal setting and viewed it as a collaborative process. Patients liked having time to talk about what was most important to them. Challenges included eliciting goals from unprepared patients, and GPs taking control of the goal rather than working through it with the patient.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Goal setting required time and energy from both parties.

Goal setting involves the sharing of realistic health and wellbeing goals, and is rooted in an understanding of patients&#x02019; priorities and preferences.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> It belongs in the long tradition in medicine of listening, understanding, and bearing witness,<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and in doing so represents one mechanism by which patient-centred communication might be enacted within consultations. Patient-centred communication has been advocated for decades<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and is a key tenet of the approach advocated for people with long-term conditions.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Patients not only often want less medical intervention than their doctors think, but they also want continuity and access to a GP who knows about them as an individual.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> There are many factors preventing good communication in modern general practice,<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and remaining genuinely patient centred while exploring and negotiating patient priorities, options, and goals requires a high level of communicative competence.<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Goal setting may be particularly useful to facilitate patient-centred communication for patients with multimorbidity. However, despite four out of five consultations in general practice involving a patient with multimorbidity,<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> such patients are often treated using single-disease, guideline-based management, which can increase treatment burden and harmful polypharmacy.<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Doctors and patients with multimorbidity working together on what really matters to patients can improve self-management,<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and may also increase GP job satisfaction. Further benefits may include reduced polypharmacy, hospital admissions, and costs through increased patient self-efficacy, improved treatment concordance, reduced adverse effects, and the encouragement of earlier appropriate contact with primary care.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>Despite National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommendations,<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> there is little published evidence about the process of setting goals for patients with multimorbidity in primary care. In this study the authors set out to answer the question &#x02018;what are the key components of goal setting in general practice?&#x02019; through analysis of video recordings of patients and GPs during goal-setting consultations, within a trial to assess the feasibility of goal setting for patients with multimorbidity and at high risk of hospital admission.<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHOD</title><p>Data were collected during a cluster randomised controlled feasibility trial of goal setting compared with usual care planning in six general practices in the UK, as described elsewhere.<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In brief, patients who were within the top 2% at risk of unplanned admissions, eligible for a new care plan, living with &#x02265;2 long-term conditions,<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> able to communicate verbally, and deemed able to participate according to their GP were recruited.

The authors analysed 10 hours of video-recorded general practice consultations to determine the key elements of goal setting. These elements were: prior preparation for goal setting for patients and GPs, GPs legitimising or &#x02018;bearing witness&#x02019; to the patients&#x02019; goals, and collaborative action planning.

Patients were invited to attend two appointments with a participating GP: a 20-minute goal-setting consultation to discuss and record their goals on a form, and a 10-minute follow-up 6 months later. The GSS and goal-recording forms, for both consultations, are available from the authors on request.

Focus groups were guided by a topic guide that was informed by initial analysis of the consultations, audio-recorded, and transcribed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Goal-setting consultation recordings were watched/listened to individually by the research analysis team (two social scientists with expertise in communication skills, a GP, and a study researcher), with the team meeting weekly for 6 months to discuss and reflect on the emerging results. Using an approach the authors have previously applied to the analysis of provider&#x02013;patient consultations, transcripts were analysed by first describing the gross consultation structure and delineating activity types.<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The gross structure comprised nine steps/activities based on the original training model: pre-beginning, preparation and opening, eliciting goals, assessing options, making goals SMART, decision making, summary, evaluation, and closure. A subsequent activity-based analysis examined verbal and non-verbal evidence from the consultations to explore how these key aspects of the goal-setting consultation were enacted by GPs and patients. This involved coding of a priori tasks and their related competencies (skills) in core aspects of patient-centred communication (<xref rid="table3" ref-type="table">Box 1</xref>). A central focus was on patterns of interaction within activities,<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> themes relating to how goal setting was attempted and achieved, and the management of communication challenges.<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Open coding was used for emergent findings. Focus group data were indexed and charted by four of the researchers using thematic analysis to generate codes and reveal themes,<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> building on the findings of the activity-based analysis.</p><p>The authors actively sought dissenting cases to fully explore the complexity of goal setting and its communicative challenges. They also sought to validate their initial findings through sharing a sub-sample of four transcripts with two public and patient involvement (PPI) representatives with expertise in the formal and informal care sector. This served as a form of member checking and helped to strengthen the validity for the analysis. Four PPI representatives contributed to a consultation event to discuss findings.</p><p>This article reports on the key themes identified throughout the goal-setting process using extracts from the goal-setting consultations and focus group interviews.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Four male GPs and one female GP from three market-town practices took part in the intervention (<xref rid="table1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

This process involved a significant investment of time, negotiation, deliberation, and shared decision making about the steps towards goal attainment, as well as setting a nominal target. However, making goals measurable could overcomplicate and distance the patient from their own goal, and sometimes it became unrealistic to reach a goal within the timeframe, for example, due to unanticipated ill health. Yet still the process could be helpful for both; and in assessing a goal the skill was in knowing if a goal had been achieved or felt successful to a patient, rather than the GP forcing a target.</p><p>There were times when GPs felt the process involved <italic>&#x02018;unknown territory&#x02019;</italic> (GP014) and, interestingly, GPs in the focus group described their role as &#x02018;collaborative&#x02019; and as a &#x02018;facilitator&#x02019; of the goal-setting process:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;&#x02026; so, yes just to facilitate them assessing their own goals um and then holding them to them, so um, so it&#x02019;s, yeah basically that&#x02019;s how I saw myself, you know. The initial meeting was to facilitate setting them and then 6-month review to try and hold up a mirror and see what we&#x02019;d achieved and, and then try and set some new ones.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(GP026)</attrib></disp-quote>
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;Yeah I would agree that you felt the facilitator, an interesting thing was actually how you then go about it.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(FG, GP018)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>Highlighting the fact that it was about setting up a process, a patient at the focus group shared:

Pt206 (F, 70&#x02013;74 years) responded in the opening minutes of the consultation to the GP&#x02019;s suggestion: <italic>&#x02018;if there&#x02019;s anything</italic> (that) <italic>immediately jumps out at you as something you&#x02019;d like to try and achieve&#x02019;</italic> with a definitive <italic>&#x02018;I&#x02019;d like to put on more weight&#x02019;</italic>. After several minutes of exploration of this priority and discussion about appetite loss and digestive problems, GP026 clarified the priority and explored exactly how the goal could be specified, actioned, and ultimately measured; the GP and patient collaborated and negotiated to agree a realistic target (see lines 14&#x02013;28).</p><table-wrap id="table7" position="anchor"><label>Box 5.</label><caption><p>Example of collaborative action planning<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tfn5"><sup>a</sup></xref></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Time, minutes:seconds</bold></th><th valign="bottom" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Line</bold></th><th valign="bottom" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Speaker</bold></th><th valign="bottom" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Excerpt</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="4" valign="top" align="left" colspan="1">13:01</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="2" valign="top" align="left" colspan="1">GP026</td><td rowspan="2" valign="top" align="left" colspan="1">So it&#x02019;s about eating er so what I need to do is put, so we need to write down here our goal=</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>3</bold></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Pt206</bold></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>=Right</bold></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 lines omitted</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td colspan="4" valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1">

The patient, however, owned and was clearly motivated by the goal, having stated that they were keen to get stronger and lessen their falls and fracture risk. This had been an ongoing health issue but it appeared to be the first time the patient had decided to prioritise it. What was key to this goal was not only that it was the patient&#x02019;s priority, turned into a realistic goal, but also that the goal itself is collaboratively agreed and actioned. This patient gained &#x0003e;2 kg of the target at the 6-month follow-up consultation.</p></sec><sec><title>GP engagement</title><p>Just as patient buy-in and engagement was essential, so was GP engagement. GPs valued the process and were unanimous in their enthusiasm for setting goals with patients. Several reported they had already started to use the core principles with other patients including the idea of asking the patient what really mattered to them most:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;It kind of made you appreciate how much good, good medicine, good patient&#x02013;doctor interaction you can get in that period and how useful it can be and how, how nice it is to get to know your patients that little bit more, yeah.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(GP018)</attrib></disp-quote>
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;Yes, I found it actually, it was almost a pleasure to see you had one of the patients coming up &#x02026; um rather than dealing with today, well firefighting today&#x02019;s problem, so, I enjoyed that aspect of it.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(FG, GP026)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>Though the process and procedures (including paperwork) were seen as useful, GPs described personal satisfaction with the consultations regardless of the type of goal set and/or attained, highlighting its therapeutic power. They valued that goals were patient centred and focused on things that could change. Furthermore, it appeared to give a patient permission to focus on a particular priority and GPs the opportunity to get to know their patients better and explore problems more fully. It was the opposite of box ticking and GPs were keen to stress that goals should not become tests or provoke anxiety; only one goal (or even no goals) was fine:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;The joy of it, you know what, the joy, the joy of it was not having to tick box really much at all and having stuff written down, pen and paper.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(GP018)</attrib></disp-quote>
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;Um but I, I think it has had some subtle effect in terms of listening and waiting &#x0201c;what do you want&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;what would be an achievement&#x0201d; and the, you know, another example is the patient who, whose goal was to walk around the block again um, he didn&#x02019;t achieve it because he didn&#x02019;t, you couldn&#x02019;t initiate any action to do it but that clarified so much for him and if that&#x02019;s the goal, then it doesn&#x02019;t matter whether that&#x02019;s with or without heart failure, for example, and I find that a really good benefit of whatever intervention measured by a real-life goal is much easier to sell than the benefit of lowering cholesterol by X per cent.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(FG, GP014)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>Although GPs reported that the skills they used were not new in terms of communicating across complex situations and patient problems, they did report an increase in confidence following the training and appreciated the <italic>&#x02018;step-by-step&#x02019;</italic> (GP014) approach.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Summary</title><p>The GPs had an important role in listening and bearing witness to their patients&#x02019; goals, even when it was not always clear how or whether the goal would be achieved. This seemed to work better when the GP and patient were prepared to set goals and for a different, more equal, and balanced consultation. The three main components that made goal setting effective were patient and GP engagement and preparation, supportive goal elicitation, and collaborative action planning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Patients liked having time to discuss what was most important to them about their health. They liked knowing they would see the same GP, as personal continuity of care was rare in usual practice and particularly valued for goal setting. GPs valued the process and time to deliver person-centred care.</p><p>Goal setting required time and energy by GP and patient, and there were challenges. For example, some patients were unclear what the consultation and research were about, and had not prepared goals; some GPs struggled to identify suitable goals that they could assist with; other GPs wrestled with which goals should be included. There were problems with making some goals measurable and achievable, either because the goal did not lend itself to being measured, or because the GP&#x02019;s attempt to configure an activity into a formal goal with a pre-specified time point overcomplicated and distanced the patient from their own goal.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This research is the first to focus in-depth on doctor&#x02013;patient communication during goal-setting consultations in primary care. Video analysis of more than 10 hours of goal-setting consultations enabled significant learning about healthcare communication, with transparency from detailed transcriptions and video analysis, and the involvement of an interdisciplinary study team.</p><p>Patients who participated were fairly representative of people living with &#x02265;2 long-term conditions and among the most at risk of unplanned hospital admissions. Without exception they were living with declining health and life-limiting conditions. Focus groups enabled rigour and data triangulation of analytical interpretations of video data, as did the PPI representative involvement in the analysis. Limitations include that the GPs and patients had self-selected to take part in the feasibility study, though were randomised to the intervention arm.</p><p>This feasibility study took place in only three intervention practices in the East of England involving five GPs and 22 patients. It is known that even where practitioners set out to discover the patient&#x02019;s own personal goals, long established patterns of interaction and role relationship by both parties can mean doctors assume and maintain power and patients passively or actively resist. However, findings presented here provide important insights into the circumstances under which goal setting can be beneficial for both GP and patient, providing theoretical propositions for testing in a larger definitive trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with existing literature</title><p>There are few other comparable studies. A recent systematic review of goal setting with patients who were older confirmed the need for studies to examine the effects of personalised care planning on goal attainment, <italic>&#x02018;especially patient&#x02019;s personal goals as opposed to goals determined by clinicians or researchers&#x02019;</italic>.<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Kangovi <italic>et al</italic> found that patients with chronic conditions from low socioeconomic groups thought broadly about their goals when encouraged to.<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Most published literature on goal setting suggests goals are often constrained or amended by the healthcare team, frequently clinically prioritised rather than patient prioritised, amended or constrained by the clinician, and reoriented to a biomedical focus,<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> and, in rehabilitation settings, there is evidence that patients may be ill prepared to play a more proactive role and therefore not have goals in mind.<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Implications for research and practice</title><p>Further analysis of this body of data will investigate the detailed interactional negotiation of goal setting, and additional research is needed to explore the impact of lower health literacy and socioeconomic and mental health status on goal setting for patients with multimorbidity. Nonetheless, this study has managed to offer useful evidence for an approach that GPs can use to work effectively with patients who have multiple long-term conditions.</p><p>There is need for such an approach: GP workload is increasing, in part due to the demands of the growing population with multimorbidity. The approach offered in this article was acceptable to and valued by GPs. Furthermore, it may be easily translated into practice as the steps involved (GP and patient preparation, patient-centred goal elicitation, and collaborative action planning) correlate with existing models of communication skills for primary care.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the patients, GPs, and the four public and patient involvement (PPI) representatives who took part in this study.</p></ack><notes><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This paper presents independent research supported by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) under its Research for Patient Benefit (RfPB) Programme (Grant Reference Number PB-PG-0215-36079) and by the NIHR Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care East of England Programme.

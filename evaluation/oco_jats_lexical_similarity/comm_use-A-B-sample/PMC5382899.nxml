incidence rate of about 0.6% to 1% of all new births<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.
Ventricular septal defect (VSD) and atrial septal defect (ASD) are two kinds of CHD
with about 30% of the total number of CHD in China<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. Currently, the main treatment methods for CHD
include cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery, percutaneous catheter interventional
occlusion and recently developed transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) guided
percutaneously with minimally invasive incision closure. Although surgical repair
has been proven to be safe and effective in conventional CPB, there are some
complications related to surgery or CPB<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. In recent years, the method of transcatheter occlusion has
achieved good curative effect, but it is limited by the age and weight of the
patient, and will cause a certain degree of radiation injury. Therefore, the small
incision closure with TEE guided with minimally invasive technique has attracted the
attention of many surgeons<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. In the present study, we compared
the clinical outcomes of routine surgical procedures in the treatment of CHD with
the closure of ASD under the guidance of TEE.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>From 2011 to 2014, 14 patients (3 males and 11 females) with ASD underwent
minimally invasive transthoracic occlusion surgery under guidance of TEE (TEE
group). Median age was 16 years (range, 2 to 46 years). Body mass ranged from
11.5 to 72 kg (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Mild, moderate
and severe pulmonary hypertension were presented for 5, 2 and none patients,
respectively. Fourteen cases (6 males and 8 females) with ASD undergoing CPB)
surgery at the same period were used as control (CPB group). Median age was 21
years (range, 3 to 55 years). Body mass ranged from 12 to 76 kg. Mild, moderate
and severe pulmonary hypertension were presented for 5, 2 and 1 patients,
respectively. The maximum and minimum diameters for ASD were 25 mm and 5 mm,
respectively. Based on the World Health Organization definition, mild, moderate
and severe pulmonary hypertension refer to the pulmonary artery systolic
pressure of 30~40 mmHg, 40~70 mmHg and &#x0003e;70 mmHg, respectively.</p><table-wrap id="t1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Age, weight and gender in two groups.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="all"><colgroup span="1"><col width="20%" span="1"/><col width="20%" span="1"/><col width="20%" span="1"/><col width="20%" span="1"/><col width="20%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TEE group</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CPB group</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">t</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>P</italic> value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.15</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.26</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">37.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">46.8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.25</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.22</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (% of male)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">46</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.05 (chisq)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.30</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>This study was a prospective and non-randomized study and it was approved by the

&#x0003e;1-year-old and weight &#x0003e; 8 kg; (2) ASD diameter form 5 mm to 34 mm; (3)
the distances from edge of the defect to the coronary sinus, the superior and

malformations required surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Procedures</title><p>ASD occluders were provided by Lifetech Scientific (Shenzhen Co., China) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). The ASD occluder is covered by a
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) membrane that minimizes the chance of clot
formation and has a small volume to get into lower profile sheath. ASD occluders
have safe long-term biocompatibility and promote the growth of endothelial
tissue, lessen thrombus complication and effectively reduce atrioventricular
block occurrence.</p><p>

</p><p>The patients were placed in the supine position followed by inhaled general
anesthesia. The TEE checks were used to verify the defect malformations. The
surgical procedures were described previously<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>. Briefly, patients were placed on the
operation-table at prone position. The incisions on the chest wall at the fourth
intercostal space right lateral sternal for ASD were 2.0 ~ 3.0 cm in length
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). Heparin with dose of 200
U/kg was intravenously injected after pericardium incision. At the site of the
selected cardiac wall, double U-shape suture were sewed followed by placing the
outer self-made delivery sheath and guide probe into the cardiac chamber or main
pulmonaryartery. The delivery rod was pushed into the corresponding chamber of
the heart along the guide wire through the defects under TEE surveillance. The
guide wire was pulled out while the occluder was placed into the inner delivery
sheath. The &#x0201c;push-pull&#x0201d; test was done to adjust the position of the occluder
release. The delivery sheath and the safe wire were cut off and pulled out of
the heart, then the double U-shape suture were ligated strictly after lungs
inflation. The thoracic incisions were closed layer by layer.</p><p>

</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>CPB routine surgery is the main approach for the treatment of CHD<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. However, CPB had disadvantages such as damage of the sternum
structure and surrounding tissue caused by sternotomy and retractor exposure of
unsuccessful surgical incision and slow recovery of postoperative period and
prolonged hospitalization. In this regard, the cardiovascular surgeon has been
exploring a less invasive surgical approach, including transcatheter closure
technique or heart defect repair with video assisted thoracoscopic
surgery<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Since King et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> reported the
first case of the catheter based closure of VSD in 1976, transcatheter closure
techniques have been rapidly developed with the successful development of the
Amplatzer occluder and other new equipment. Among them, percutaneous transcatheter
closure is the most popular one, but it has some disadvantages: 1) the requirement
of the use of contrast agents which causes the radiation exposure to both doctors
and patients; 2) non continuously real-time monitoring; 3) unclear imaging of heart
structure; and 4) the dependence of patients&#x02019; age and weight as well as the size of
the occluder and the methods of operation. Therefore, the application of the TEE
reaches a new stage of the development of transcatheter closure technique.</p><p>TEE is developed on the basis of conventional echocardiography<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. The probe is placed in the esophagus, which is close to the
posterior wall of the left atrium without interference of the chest wall and lung
gas. The advantages of TEE are: 1) clear imaging of heart structure and peripheral
vessel; 2) real-time observation of the position of guiding steel wire, sheath and
occluder in the heart and blood vessel; 3) clear demonstration of the position
between the occluder and defect; 4) immediate observation of the effect of the
occluder in case the timely adjustment is required; 5) clear display of closure of
atrial or ventricular shunt and complications after closure with color Doppler
ultrasound.</p><p>This study showed the decreases in the operation time, postoperative ICU stay,
postoperative hospital stay, use of blood products, hospital costs and the length of
incision in the TEE group compared to CPB group. In the TEE group, 13 (92.86%)
patients were transferred to the general ward after 24h and 13 (92.86%) were
discharged within 7 days after operation. TEE guided with a minimally invasive
transthoracic occlusion technique can reduce the surgical trauma, affect less in
breathing and cough, make the postoperative nursing care simple, reduce the volume
of blood products transfusion. Patients in the TEE group can be transferred to
ordinary ward after a short period of time of operation within, therefore reducing
the total hospitalization expenses and improving the patients&#x02019; satisfaction degree
on the incision. Also, the method used in pediatric patients can not be restricted
by the age and weight. Another advantage for the use of TEE is that patients can be
readily changed the traditional surgery once defect is not suitable for closure by
using TEE or plugging failure occurs, therefore avoiding the risk and ensuring the
safety.</p><p>In the present study, the success rate of occlusion in the TEE group was 100%. In our
single center, the success rate of percutaneous closure of ASD surgery was about
98%. The reasons for the failure are that the defect is too large and close to the
valve, causing the abnormal valve opening and closing by the occluder or that the
ASD edge is too thin, impairing the occluder. However, there have been some reports
showing that success rate for TEE guided ASD occlusion was 96%<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. The causes of failure in ASD
occlusion were relatively large defect, short residual edge or porous defects.</p><p>The limitations of this study were: 1) No control of conventional percutaneous
transcatheter closure was included; 2) The comparison with CPB is not a randomized
controlled study; 3) It theoretically described the advantages of simple TEE guided
transthoracic minimally invasive transcatheter closure of CHD; and 4) Postoperative
follow-up time is short and long-term effect needs to be have a multicenter
investigation with large sample researches.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In summary, esophageal ultrasound guided with minimally invasive transthoracic
transcatheter closure for CHD is safe and feasible. It can reduce the trauma
happened in the conventional open surgery. It has small incision and avoids the
multiple organ injury caused by CPB, which is beneficial for the early
rehabilitation of patients. In addition, it also has advantages of less drainage
quantity, less blood transfusion, less postoperative complications, short hospital
stay, relatively low cost in hospitalization and good social and economic benefits.
However, not all ASD patients are suitable for TEE technique and it is necessary to
strictly control the indications. The operation specification of TEE technique needs
to have a multicenter investigation with large sample researches.</p><table-wrap id="t3" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="10%" span="1"/><col width="90%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors&#x02019; roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ZG</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Conception and study design, realization of operations;

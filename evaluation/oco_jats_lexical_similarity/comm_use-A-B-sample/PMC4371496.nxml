First, there is inconsistent obstetric practice. Hospitals across the USA lack a standard approach to managing obstetric emergencies and the complications of pregnancy and childbirth are often identified too late. Nationally endorsed plans to manage obstetric emergencies and updated training and guidance on implementing these plans is a serious and ongoing need.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref></p><p>A second factor is the increasing number of women who present at antenatal clinics with chronic conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity, which contribute to pregnancy-related complications. Many of these women could benefit from the closer coordination of antenatal and primary care &#x02013; including case management and other community-based services that help them access care and overcome cost and other obstacles. In the USA, women who lack health insurance are three to four times more likely to die of pregnancy-related complications than their insured counterparts.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref></p><p>Another factor is the general lack of good data &#x02013; and related analysis &#x02013; on maternal health outcomes. Only half the USA&#x02019;s states have maternal mortality review boards and the data that are collected are not systematically used to guide changes that could reduce maternal mortality and morbidity. There is no national forum for the states to share either their best practices for reviewing maternal deaths or the relevant lessons that they may have learned.</p><p>There is a growing effort by physicians, nurses and community organizations to address these three factors. Hospitals are beginning to implement standard approaches to managing obstetric emergencies so that, wherever a woman gives birth, she receives appropriate evidence-based care. Community initiatives are coordinating care for high-risk women to ensure good health and management of chronic conditions during and beyond pregnancy. More states are establishing or strengthening maternal mortality review boards.</p><p>Recent changes to national policies should also help improve maternal health outcomes. In 2010 the Affordable Care Act included antenatal and maternal care as essential health benefits that insurance plans must cover. By extending insurance coverage to pregnant women with low incomes, many states have lowered the economic hurdles that limit access to antenatal care for millions of women. As the health community solidifies the post-2015 agenda to end preventable maternal mortality, the USA needs to be brought into the global dialogue on maternal health. Although maternal mortality is relatively rare in the USA, one preventable maternal death is one too many. All states need to mobilize health providers, policy-makers and communities to make maternal health a priority. With increased awareness of maternal mortality and life-threatening events &#x02013; and concrete actions to ensure that pregnant women get the quality care they need &#x02013; many fatal and near-fatal complications could be prevented.</p></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>I thank Heather&#x000a0;L Sings (Merck), Maria Schneider (Rabin Martin) and Dana Huber (Rabin Martin).</p></ack><fn-group><title>Competing interests:</title><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>PA is the executive director of Merck for Mothers and owns Merck stock.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="web">Trends in maternal mortality: 1990 to 2013.

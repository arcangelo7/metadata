The ability to reliably locate and assess the degree of neovascularity is therefore clinically important. The Modified Ohberg Score (MOS) is frequently used to determine degree of neovascularity, but reliability has yet to be established among Sport and Exercise Medicine (SEM) consultants. This study aims to determine inter-rater and intra-rater reliability of an SEM consultant cohort when assessing neovascularity using the 5-point MOS.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p>Eleven participants (7 male and 4 female) provided 16 symptomatic Achilles and patella tendons. These were sequentially examined using power Doppler (PD) enabled ultrasound (US) imaging by 6 SEM consultants who rated neovascular changes seen using the MOS. Representative digital scan images were saved for rescoring 3 weeks later. Inter-rater and intra-rater reliability of the MOS was examined using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Kappa Agreement scores.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Neovascular changes were reported in 65.6% of 96 scans undertaken. ICC for inter-rater reliability was 0.86 and Fleiss Kappa 0.52. ICC for intra-rater reliability was 0.95 and Weighted Kappa 0.91.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Neovascular changes were present in two-thirds of symptomatic tendons. Excellent SEM consultant inter-rater and intra-rater reliability was demonstrated. These findings support the use of PD-enabled US to assess neovascularity by appropriately experienced SEM consultants. Furthermore, future interventional research using a similarly experienced SEM consultant cohort can be undertaken with assurance that assessment of neovascularity will be reliable.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>tendinopathy</kwd><kwd>achilles</kwd><kwd>ultrasound</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000384</institution-id><institution>Higher Education Funding Council for England</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>What are the new findings?</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Appropriately trained Sport and Exercise Medicine consultants have excellent inter-rater and intra-rater reliability using power Doppler enabled ultrasound to assess neovascularity in chronic Achilles and patellar tendinopathy.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Previously, such results have only been demonstrated among sonographers and radiologists.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Neovascularity is present in two-thirds of chronic Achilles and patellar tendinopathies.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Incidence and prevalence of Achilles and patellar tendinopathies are increased in physically active populations.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;3</xref> During the progression of tendinopathic disease, the formation and ingrowth of neovascular structures into the tendon is a widely recognised pathological hallmark.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;7</xref> The role of neovascularisation within tendinopathy is the source of significant interest regarding its contribution to the pathophysiology of the injured and healing tendon.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 8</xref> It may also be associated with neoneuralisation<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> exacerbated by nociceptive stimuli such as glutamate<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and substance P.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> This provides an explanation as to why the point of ingress of vessels into the tendon is often associated with the site of maximal pain on palpation.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Neovascularisation is a normal physiological response in early repair, and its continued presence is likely to be a result of prolonged overload that delays the healing timeline.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Association between neovascularity and pain and function has been shown in small interventional case and longitudinal studies<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;17</xref> yet refuted in Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT)<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and only weakly correlated in a larger prospective cohort.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> This supports the theory that neovascularity may&#x000a0;be more a sign of chronicity than severity. Polidocanol<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and high volume image-guided injections (HVIGI)<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> target the presence of vessels in order to address this proposed pain stimulus.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 19</xref> To that end, the ability to reliably locate and quantify vascularity is clinically relevant.</p><p>The hypoechoic areas seen in tendinopathy on gray-scale ultrasound&#x000a0;(US) offer limited information which can be enhanced by the use of power Doppler (PD) to identify hyperaemic neovasculature.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 10 14 20 21</xref> In clinical practice, there have been 3&#x000a0;methods of assessing the degree of neovascularisation. The first is a simple statement of whether vessels are either absent or present in the tendon structure.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Depending on the significance of degree of vascularity as discussed above, the utility of such binary grading is likely to be limited. A second system involves determining the PD signal surface area by pixel count. Although a seemingly robust method of capturing a quantifiable measure of neovascularity, these authors recognise that interpretation of findings in clinical practice will be both machine and operator setting dependent.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref> A third method was pioneered by Ohberg and Alfredson<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> who undertook PD US examination of symptomatic Achilles tendons to understand the extent of neovascularity and locate target areas for sclerosing polidocanol injections. In this study, an experienced sonographer assessed neovascularisation as 0,&#x000a0;1+, 2+, 3+&#x000a0;or 4+. In the absence of vessels, the tendon scored a 0. A score of 1+&#x000a0;was ascribed if the tendon showed 1&#x02013;2 small vessels primarily around the anterior surface of the tendon. Scores of 2+, 3+&#x000a0;or 4+&#x000a0;were given if the vessel contained 2, 3 or more than 4 vessels respectively throughout its structure. They later adapted this score for use in patellar tendinopathy with the score of 1+&#x000a0;referring&#x02009;to 1&#x02013;2 vessels mostly in the posterior portion of that tendon.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>Sengkerij&#x000a0;<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> undertook an inter-rater reliability study in which a cohort of radiologists undertook PD US examinations of symptomatic and asymptomatic Achilles tendons and rated the neovascularisation referring to the system described above as the Modified Ohberg Score (MOS). Of the 50 tendons examined in the study, each underwent scans by 2 of 8 radiologists. Excellent reliability was found with absolute agreement of 62% and an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.85. Sunding&#x000a0;<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> used a more qualitative 4-point MOS for neovascularity: 0,&#x000a0;None; 1,&#x000a0;Mild; 2,&#x000a0;Moderate; 3,&#x000a0;Severe. They therefore used Kappa in their analysis of 27 Achilles and 26 patella tendons finding good inter-rater agreements of 0.63 and 0.70 respectively using 2&#x000a0;sonographers.</p><p>US scanning is a common skill used frequently in clinical practice, yet there are no data to support its reliability among Sport and Exercise Medicine (SEM) consultants.

Neovascularisation was reported in 65.6% of the original scans in keeping with previous studies of Achilles and patellar tendinopathy.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 29&#x02013;31</xref> These results suggest that diagnostic US scoring of tendinopathic neovascularisation can be reliably employed in the SEM setting. The most important variable that will allow results to be extrapolated to a wider audience is the degree of clinical exposure to tendon assessment and ultrasonography clinicians have undertaken. All clinicians involved in this study described themselves as highly competent in the ultrasonography of Achilles and patella tendons, although this was not corroborated independently the results are comparable with those reported using radiologist or sonographer raters.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 24</xref></p><p>In terms of distribution of MOS, it can be noted (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>) that&#x000a0;there was a lower number of Grade 3+&#x000a0;scores attributed to any of the primary scans undertaken. This is in keeping with the findings of Sengkerij and colleagues<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> who found that only 9% of their scans received a 3+&#x000a0;score. An explanation for this is possibly that the raters find it easy to identify 1&#x02013;2 vessels within the tendon structure, but once vascularity is more prevalent, it may be difficult to differentiate the existence of additional single vessels, the result being a lean towards a higher score of 4+. As the results of this study agree with those of Sengkerij&#x000a0;<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> it may provide evidence to suggest that the 5-point scale is reduced to a 4-point scale, with the final score (grade 3) representing 3 or more vessels.</p><p>This study builds on the work of Sengkerij&#x000a0;<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> who did not attempt to control any of the operator variables once the PD setting was enabled. Of particular importance in this respect is the gain setting, which regulates the sensitivity of the system to flow.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Essentially, too high a gain and the amount of random noise artefact in the form&#x000a0;of colour foci in the image will increase, potentially affecting the clarity of colour that indicates vascular flow. In this study, the first consultant to scan a given participant was asked to select and set what they considered to be an appropriate gain, which other consultants would then use and this stayed consistent for that participant. As a result, the sensitivity of the system was standardised for each participant. Sengkerij&#x000a0;<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> used 2 radiologists each scanning session of a larger cohort (n=8). In such an uncrossed design, ICC does not readily deal with missing data. Using default SPSS settings with a one-way random ICC model cases that are not scanned by all raters would be excluded from the analysis. One solution to this would be to arrange data in 2 columns giving the appearance of a full data set from 2 raters exclusively. Collapsing data across empty columns and unequal proportions of scans undertaken by raters could overestimate the inter-rater ICC they reported of 0.85, though such limitations can only be assumed.</p><p>Arguably, the MOS is only a semiquantitative scale; therefore, this study has also used Fleiss and weighted Kappa. These favourable results compare well with Sunding&#x000a0;<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>&#x000a0;who reported Kappas of 0.63 and 0.70 in Achilles and patellar tendinopathy, respectively using 2 independent sonographers.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Weighted Kappa, which, like ICC, recognises marginal agreement and&#x000a0;does not extend to comparison of more than 2 data sets. This presents a problem for Kappa analysis of more than 2 raters. The commonly used Fleiss Kappa result in this study should be interpreted differently from the other results because it can only reward absolute agreement. Light&#x02019;s Kappa, which is the mean of all rating pairs,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> is a different solution yet not often reported. Therefore, the Fleiss Kappa has been presented in this study alongside an excellent inter-rater ICC, which has been able to provide context.</p><p>A strength of this study was the ability to recruit an appropriately powered number of consultant raters and where possible have them available for sequential scanning of all participants. Shoukri&#x000a0;<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> noted the difficulty in recruiting a number of suitably qualified specialists within the Hospital setting. While a large cohort of SEM consultants undertook ratings, short notice changes in availability were a limitation. The initial design aim for each participant to be scanned by 6 consultants sequentially in one session was achieved for 9 of 16 tendons. The remainder had to undertake subsequent scanning sessions (within a mean of 7.8 days). Boesen&#x000a0;<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> reported an increase in vessel appearance as an acute response to exercise, although postulate that this may be short-lived. As a result, those participants that were required to return for subsequent scans were requested to refrain from any activity that would either aggravate their symptoms or potentially make an acute change to the vessel appearance. This variable would have a potential to reduce consultant agreement on their primary scans of each patient, but despite this, excellent reliability was still demonstrated.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Further research</title><p>The findings of this study have direct implications for future research and clinical practice. Primarily, a subcohort of the consultants in this study are also involved in a large RCT<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> to investigate the effects of HVIGI (with and without steroid) on chronic Achilles and patella tendon pain. The neovessels found on scanning of the participants will be targeted by the injections delivered, and therefore this reliability study serves to provide assurance that the consultants are reliable when scoring neovasculature presence and extent. Furthermore, it can be extrapolated that consultants of similar experience to those in this study will provide reliable PD US assessments for future studies using the MOS, as either an outcome measure or target for intervention. In the clinical setting, this study provides evidence to support the use of diagnostic US in SEM clinical practice by proving reliability both in initial scanning and&#x000a0;in the test-retest situation, such as follow-up scanning postintervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s7"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study demonstrated excellent inter-rater and intra-rater reliability of the scoring of neovasculature within tendon structure among SEM consultants. While this contributes to the clinical assessment of patients with tendon pain, it does not explain the role of neovasculature in the pathological process or as a source of pain in chronic tendinopathy. Well-controlled research is required to establish whether procedures targeting neovascularisation can effect improvements in validated pain and functional outcome measures.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> JW and RMB-D contributed equally in study design, ethical approval, study implementation, clinical protocols, drafting and editing of the manuscript.

Population prescribing habits and their consequences have not been well-described.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a retrospective analysis of antibiotic prescriptions for non-pneumonic exacerbations of COPD from 2010 to 2015 using the UK primary care Optimum Patient Care Research Database. As a proxy of initial treatment failure, second antibiotic prescriptions for LRTI or all indications within 14 days were the primary and secondary outcomes, respectively. We derived a model for repeat courses using univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 8.4% of the 9042 incident events received further antibiotics for LRTI, 15.5% further courses for any indication. Amoxicillin and doxycycline were the most common index and second-line drugs, respectively (58.7% and 28.7%), mostly given for 7 days. Index drugs other than amoxicillin, cardiovascular disease, pneumococcal vaccination and more primary care consultations were statistically significantly associated with repeat prescriptions for LRTI (p&#x0003c;0.05). The ORs and 95% CIs were: OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.49; OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.66; OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.55 and OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.07, respectively. Index duration, inhaled steroid use and exacerbation frequency were not statistically significant. The derived model had an area under the curve of 0.61, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.63.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The prescription of multiple antibiotic courses for COPD exacerbations was relatively common&#x02014;one in twelve patients receiving antibiotics for LRTI had a further course within 2&#x02009;weeks. The findings support the current preference for amoxicillin as index drug within the limitations of this observational study. Further clinical trials to determine best practice in this common clinical situation appear required.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>anti-bacterial agents</kwd><kwd>lower respiratory tract infections</kwd><kwd>treatment failure</kwd><kwd>chronic obstructive</kwd><kwd>Pulmonary Disease</kwd><kwd>primary healthcare</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000272</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Dr Stolbrink is a NIHR Academic Clinical Fellow at</award-id></award-group><award-group id="funding-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000832</institution-id><institution>Dowager Countess Eleanor Peel Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX2" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Key messages</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A substantial proportion of COPD patients received a second course of antibiotics within fourteen days of the index prescription.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Amoxicillin was prescribed most commonly as the index drug and was associated with fewer repeat antibiotic prescriptions.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Shorter index courses were not associated with more repeat prescriptions.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are globally the most common infectious cause of morbidity.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Despite this prevalence, observed duration of antibiotic treatment for LRTI varies greatly, and there is disagreement between guidelines on the optimal duration.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Effective first-line treatment for non-pneumonic LRTI in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients (&#x02018;infective exacerbations&#x02019;) is an area of particular uncertainty.</p><p>COPD is a common cause of disability, and estimated to become the third leading cause of death worldwide in 2030.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;5</xref> Exacerbations form a large part of the disease burden and can lead to a cough with discoloured phlegm irrespective of causation.

LRTI codes included those for chest infection and bronchitis. We analysed only the first event for each individual to exclude repeated measurements from the same patient. Primary outcome was a new antibiotic prescription with an LRTI code within 14 days of the index prescription. Secondary outcome was further antibiotic prescription within 14 days for any indication. We excluded cases with a coded diagnosis of pneumonia, other chronic respiratory diseases, such as asthma, people younger than 16 years and those whose index antibiotic course was either not specified or was longer than 28 days.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Data source</title><p>The OPCRD comprised data extracted through the Optimum Patient Care Clinical Service Evaluation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://optimumpatientcare.org/opcrd/">http://optimumpatientcare.org/opcrd/</ext-link>).

Univariably, mean differences in continuous variables were analysed via t-tests, while ORs for binary variables were analysed via logistic regression.

Statistically significant results were defined as p&#x0003c;0.10 for univariable analysis (to show trends) and p&#x0003c;0.05 for multivariable analysis. Collinear associations between clinically plausible-related predictors were assessed using Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficients. Factors were included in the multivariable model based on clinical plausibility. Adjusted ORs and CIs were presented where appropriate. Visual inspection of the functional form of each continuous variable suggested that no transformation was required. Multivariable models were derived via backwards parsimonious logistic regression, including linear regression for mean differences, and the resulting models were tested for goodness of fit.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Demographics</title><p>There were 22&#x02009;003 unique prescriptions for LRTI in adult COPD patients between 01 January 2010 and 31 December 2015 in the OPCRD.

A substantial proportion of patients (15.5%) received further antibiotics within 14 days of the index antibiotic prescription. Over half of the repeat prescriptions within 14 days were coded for another LRTI (52.1%). Amoxicillin as index drug was associated with fewer repeat prescriptions. Older age and some markers of COPD severity were associated with increased risk of apparent initial treatment failure.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>One of the strengths of the study is the genuine, unselected primary care population as demonstrated, for example, by 97.2% not having had a respiratory outpatient appointment and 46.4% not having had an exacerbation in the prior year. This contrasts with most interventional studies which have highly selected patient populations&#x02014;for example, it has been estimated that only up to 7% of people treated for COPD meet inclusion criteria for randomised trials.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Real-life data, such as this, have an important role in helping to inform real-life decision-making.</p><p>We analysed electronic health records. In the era of advancing electronic records, there is a drive to use more routinely collected data particularly in primary care research, for example, by the National Institute for Health Research or highlighted in the Salford Lung Study, to reduce burden on patients, bias and approximate real-world practice.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25</xref> However, the reliance on primary care data is also this study&#x02019;s major limitation&#x02014;chiefly, the 59% of patients for whom no duration was clearly documented for their index duration of antibiotics. This reflects the true documentation practice in primary care, where coding can be challenging.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> We are unable to distinguish appropriate from inappropriate antibiotic prescribing using this large primary care database, in keeping with large variation in antibiotic prescribing in primary care found in other studies that could not entirely be explained by patient characteristics.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> It is also likely that other factors, such as presence of purulent sputum or prior microbiology results, influenced decisions for repeat antibiotic prescribing. A cross-sectional primary care study in Europe, Asia and South America showed that purulent sputum and use of C reactive protein were the strongest predictors of initial antibiotic prescribing in COPD exacerbations.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>We examined more antibiotic courses over 5 years than an earlier primary care COPD exacerbation analysis from 2005 to 2010.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> This study of 12&#x02009;609 exacerbations also showed a high prevalence of antibiotic prescribing within 7 days of presentation (66% cases). We also reported repeat antibiotic prescribing for any indication to ensure no LRTI prescriptions were missed as not all repeat prescriptions for LRTI will have been coded appropriately.</p><p>We were limited by the potential for missing data on secondary care contacts (eg, emergency department attendances and hospital admissions) and use of other healthcare services (eg, out of hours and walk-in centres). The imperfect recording of such data is anticipated to lead to an underestimate of the true number of repeat prescriptions issued as lack of improvement increases the probability of accessing providers other than the patient&#x02019;s usual general practitioner. We acknowledge that some treatment failures would result in hospitalisation, and these could be incorrectly coded as if the treatment was successful (ie, no repeat course of antibiotics from primary care). However, community-treated exacerbations of COPD are far more common than hospitalisations, and most people admitted have not completed antibiotics in the community, so any effect on the analyses would be modest.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> There was no explicit coding for repeat or continuous antibiotics in this data set. However, such prescriptions would have been excluded (as we did not include antibiotic courses that had a duration that was either not specified or was longer than 28 days) unless they were rotating antibiotics which are used very rarely, for example, 1 patient in over 92&#x02009;000 cases studied in a large retrospective primary care analysis.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The use of long-term antibiotics in COPD patients remains rare (eg, 0.61% in the above study) and no long-term studies exist in these patients.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28&#x02013;30</xref> Our study is also limited by primary care coding of COPD rather than the use of source data, such as lung function.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Setting in current literature and future directions</title><p>Durations of 7 days remained most prominent across different situations, but index duration was not significantly associated with further prescriptions.

Owing to the observational, retrospective nature of the analysed data sets, the causality of effects is difficult to ascertain. This is particularly true given a further limitation of our study: sputum culture results were not sufficiently commonly or systematically recorded to be included in the analyses.</p><p>ICS have previously shown to be associated with increased risk of pneumonia, particularly older and more severely airway constrained patients.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35&#x02013;37</xref> These factors were associated with apparent treatment failure in our univariable analyses, but not in the final models.</p><p>Amoxicillin, doxycycline and erythromycin/clarithromycin were the most commonly used antibiotics. The prevalence of amoxicillin decreased from 58.7% to 25.8% in the repeat prescriptions but remained an important contributor. This may reflect practitioners attempting to address relevant pathogens, such as <italic>M. catarrhalis</italic> and <italic>H. influenzae</italic>, in the repeat courses that are usually resistant to penicillins.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> However, in contrast to this, not using amoxicillin as index antibiotic was significantly associated with the risk of repeat prescriptions for LRTI and all indications. This warrants further investigation on the pathogens of these exacerbations, particularly to differentiate true failure of antibiotic action from unacceptable side effects from the index treatment. Respiratory viruses were identified in almost 40% of patients with COPD exacerbations and only 40%&#x02013;50% of exacerbations were thought to be caused by bacteria.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> Non-bacterial exacerbations would improve irrespective of antibiotic treatment and inappropriately treated exacerbations may present as treatment failure.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Prescription of further antibiotics for LRTI occurred commonly in UK primary care COPD patients from 2010 to 2015.

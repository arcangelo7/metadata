Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene wear-induced osteolysis is the process by which prosthetic debris mechanically released from the surface of prosthetic joints induces an immune response that favors bone catabolism, resulting in loosening of prostheses with eventual failure or fracture. The immune response initiated is innate in that it is nonspecific and self-propagating, with monocytic cells and osteoclasts being the main effectors. To date, detecting disease early enough to implement effective intervention without unwanted systemic side effects has been a major barrier. These barriers can be overcome using newer <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging techniques and modules linked with fluorescence and/or chemotherapies. We discuss the pathogenesis of osteolysis, and provide discussion of the challenges with imaging and therapeutics. We describe a positron emission tomography imaging cinnamoyl-Phe-(D)-Leu-Phe-(D)-Leu-Phe-Lys module, specific to macrophages, which holds promise in early detection of disease and localization of treatment. Further research and increased collaboration among therapeutic and three-dimensional imaging researchers are essential in realizing a solution to clinical osteolysis in TJA.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is often considered one of the success stories of modern medicine, as it provides reliable long-term improvement in patient function, pain, and quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1 bib2 bib3 bib4 bib5 bib6 bib7 bib8">1&#x02013;8</xref></sup> Aseptic loosening (AL) by periprosthetic osteolysis is the leading cause of failure after TJA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4 bib5 bib6">4&#x02013;6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> with reported incidence rates ranging from 10% to 70%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> The incidence of TJA is increasing, with over four million primary total hip/knee arthroplasties (THA, TKA) projected annually by 2030 in the United States and revision rates expected to double even earlier.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> Patients under 65 years of age currently comprise over 40% of the population undergoing THA or TKA, with incidence among this age group expected to increase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> As more TJA is performed on increasingly younger patients, rates of osteolysis-induced AL will intensify, as young age is a known risk factor for osteolysis, TJA failure, and revision surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> Compared with primary THA or TKA, revision surgery has been shown to be costlier, technically more difficult, and associated with higher rates of complications and inferior outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15 bib16 bib17 bib18 bib19">15&#x02013;19</xref></sup> Considering this evidence, the vast impact TJA will have on US healthcare and economy in the near future quickly becomes evident. Although understanding of the mechanisms underlying osteolysis-induced AL has substantially improved in recent decades, barriers in the implementation of effective intervention obviating the need for revision surgery or minimizing its technical and financial demands still exist. These barriers revolve around difficulties in localization: early detection as osteolysis is often asymptomatic or undiagnosed until the need for revision surgery,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> and therapy that is both effective and specific enough as to avoid intolerable or undesirable systemic side effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup></p><p>Periprosthetic osteolysis is the process by which biological or mechanical forces initiate a local immune response in periprosthetic tissue that eventually results in implant loosening and failure.

Schmalzried <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> examined histological specimens from areas of bone resorption in 34 hips with radiographic evidence of periprosthetic bone loss and universally detected PE debris-laden macrophages regardless of pattern of bone loss, anatomic origin of specimen, or use of cement.

When increasing the ratio to 100:1 the response dissipated; however, particulates measuring 0.45 and 1.71&#x02009;&#x003bc;m in length then became active, paralleling their findings in another similar study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref></sup> The work of these respective authors argues that wear debris incites a unique immune response dependent on both particulate size and dose, likely incorporating natural phenomena of specificity, critical thresholds, overstimulation, and desensitization.</p><p>When challenged with wear debris, three general cellular responses have been described, depending on particulate size.

Taking this into account, it quickly becomes evident why larger particles elicited no immediate osteolytic reaction in that study. The overall immune response to UHMWPE particles has been characterized as a foreign body reaction, marked by granulomatous chronic inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Innate immune response</title><p>Although cells of monocytic lineage dominate in the pathogenesis of osteolysis, numerous cell types and inflammatory mediators have been implicated, summarized in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> and <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, respectively. Indicative of the innate immune system, NALP3 inflammasome, nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B), TNF-&#x003b1;, and IL-1&#x003b2; activation are significant to this response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5 bib6 bib7 bib8">5&#x02013;8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> Pathogenesis is diverse and multifactorial, but is ultimately driven by increased osteoclastogenesis, proinflammatory enzymatic bone resorption, and decreased osteoblastic activity. Although no secondary, adaptive immune response is implicated in UHMWPE wear-induced osteolysis, the innate response does occur in a sequential manner. The three main pathways favoring bone resorption mentioned above do not occur in isolation, but rather as a comprehensive process shifting normal bone metabolism in favor of catabolism, making a temporal presentation of osteolysis difficult. Therefore, pathogenesis will be presented in a component-based system, exhibiting temporal progression as appropriate.</p><p>T-lymphocytes have been found in periprosthetic tissue with osteolysis but are generally detected in low numbers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup> Furthermore, Pfp/Rag2 double-knockout mice (entirely lacking mature T and B lymphocytes with severe depletion of NK cell function) have been shown to develop osteolysis at similar rates to control mice with similar amounts of locally produced TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2;.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup> However, a role has been proposed for lymphocytes in osteolysis, specifically a hypersensitivity reaction to metal-on-metal prostheses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> As this current study focuses on UHMWPE wear-induced osteolysis, these reactions are beyond the scope of this study. Therefore, lymphocytes and the adapative immune response will be excluded from any further discussion.</p><sec><title>Cellular response</title><p>In order to fully comprehend the roles of monocytes, dendritic cells (DC), osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and fibroblasts in osteolysis, a basic understanding of physiologic bone metabolism must be realized. Bone is constantly under revision, formed by osteoblasts and broken down by osteoclasts under hormonal and paracrine regulation. When this homeostatic process is misbalanced in favor of catabolism, osteolysis results. Briefly, osteoclastogenesis is mediated by two growth factors: receptor activator of NF-&#x003ba;B (RANK) ligand (RANKL) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> RANKL is of the TNF superfamily; cytokines capable of inducing RANKL expression include TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2;, among others. RANKL increases TNF-&#x003b1; production and TNF-&#x003b1; enhances NF-&#x003ba;B activation, forming a compounding and synergistic positive feedback loop. Stimulation of monocytes and osteoclast progenitors (OCP) by RANKL and macrophage colony-stimulating factor results in their fusion and differentiation into mature, multinucleated osteoclasts in tissue. Osteoblasts, which produce osteoprotegerin (OPG) or osteoclastogenesis inhibitory factor, are central to NF-&#x003ba;B regulation. OPG functions as an extracellular decoy receptor for RANKL, thereby inhibiting RANK stimulation and osteoclastogenesis. Finally, these factors, which influence osteoblast/clast genesis, function, and survival, are mainly controlled by the interplay between parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, and estrogen under normal physiological conditions, summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Once fully differentiated, mature osteoclasts express tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and cathepsin K (CATK), two enzymes essential to their lytic function.</p><p>UHMWPE particles induce inflammation and stimulate macrophages by a variety of mechanisms. One such mechanism occurs through Toll-like receptor (TLR) activity. TLRs are expressed in many inflammatory cells, especially those of monocytic lineage, and their stimulation promotes phagocytosis and initiates an innate immune response mediated through NF-&#x003ba;B activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43 bib44 bib45">43&#x02013;45</xref></sup> Classically, TLRs are stimulated by pathogen- or damage-associated molecular patterns in response to infection or tissue damage, allowing for an early inflammatory response. Maitra <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref></sup> demonstrated that UHMWPE particles are comprised of alkane polymers capable of directly stimulating TLR2 and TLR1/2 <italic>in vitro</italic>, leading to their phagocytosis and subsequent immune activation. When recovered from osteolytic tissue, a majority of these alkane polymers were found to have undergone extensive carbonyl modification, indicative of oxidative damage likely mediated enzymatically by cells of monocytic lineage. A positive correlation was observed between amount of oxidation of alkane polymers and their affinity for TLR, with oxidized polymers exhibiting up to a 140-fold increase in binding affinity. In a subsequent study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> Maitra <italic>et al.</italic> observed that the endosomes of inflammatory infiltrates of periprosthetic tissue challenged with UHMWPE were engorged with alkane particles. The failure of the endosomal enzymes to degrade UHMWPE led to an increase in endosome compartment size, number, and fusion, with some observed along the plasma membrane undergoing exocytosis. Unsurprisingly, necrotic cells were observed in the surrounding tissue, with UHMWPE particles, cathepsin, and collagen damage detected. This tissue injury generates heat shock proteins and other damage-associated molecular patterns,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref></sup> further increasing TLR activation. Incubation with oxidized alkanes activated DCs, macrophages, monocytes, and osteoclasts, with each expressing an upregulation of surface major histocompatibility complex class II, B7&#x02013;1, B7&#x02013;2, and CD40 molecules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> Significantly, these cells exhibited an increase in TLR1 and TLR2 mRNA transcription, with the upregulation of IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, TNF-&#x003b1;, and IFN-&#x003b3;. These findings present many implications for the immune response to UHMWPE wear, most importantly that UHMWPE is capable of inciting a nonspecific and self-propagating innate immune response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref></sup></p><p>Another important finding by Maitra <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> in the previously described study is that TLR stimulation of monocytes and macrophages induced pro-IL-1&#x003b2; expression but not the release of mature IL-1&#x003b2;, the actions of which are summarized in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Instead, endosomal destabilization and NALP3 inflammasome activity have been characterized as mediators of IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-18 maturation and release.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48 bib49 bib50">48&#x02013;50</xref></sup> NALP3, when activated, complexes with adapter protein PYCARD, leading to caspase-1 recruitment and activation. Caspase-1 subsequently cleaves pro-IL-1&#x003b2; and pro-IL-18 into their active forms, allowing for their secretion. DCs treated with UHMWPE particles <italic>in vitro</italic> expressed increased levels of caspase-1 and active IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-18, which were subsequently downregulated after cathepsin inhibition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> In demonstrating that NALP3 inflammasome activity was integral to the development of pneumoconiosis (a disease process also characterized by foreign body reaction), Cassel <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref></sup> reported that inflammasome activation required reactive oxygen species generation and an efflux of potassium. NALP3 inflammasome activation therefore occurs by two mechanisms, both of which are consistent with osteolysis: reactive oxygen species and other danger signal (ATP, urate, and so on) generation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref></sup> and cathepsin release.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> When osteoclasts, macrophages, and DCs phagocytose UHMWPE particles &#x0003c;10&#x02009;&#x003bc;m, they are unable to degrade them, leading to endosomal instability and the subsequent spilling of cathepsin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> This damage undoubtedly releases both self and neighboring intracellular contents that likely signal NALP3 activation further, paralleling the findings by Cassel <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref></sup> Furthermore, as UHMWPE particles are released secondary to endosomal instability, they are likely re-phagocytosed by other activated cells, leading to a perpetual inflammatory cascade in the local periprosthetic environment. When challenged by larger UHMWPE particles &#x0003e;20&#x02009;&#x003bc;m, multinucleated giant cells are formed that undergo &#x0201c;frustrated phagocytosis,&#x0201d; where UHMWPE is trapped near the cell surface, activating NADPH oxidases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref></sup> These oxidases generate reactive oxygen species contributing to NALP3 inflammasome activation. Coupled with TLR-induced cytokine transcription, NALP3 inflammasome and caspase-1 activity allow IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-18 to contribute to development of osteolysis, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. A take home point from NALP3 inflammasome activation and activity is again that a nonspecific, self-propagating immune response is initiated, destroying natural tissue architecture in a local environment. Despite the inflammatory response described, detection of osteolysis remains challenging, expounded upon further in Detection and diagnosis section.</p><p>Although bone destruction is mainly regulated by local proinflammatory factors in a periprosthetic microenvironment, systemic macrophage/OCP involvement is reported. Ren <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> continuously infused saline or UHMWPE particles into mice femora and injected reporter bioluminescent macrophages into tail veins. Upon noninvasive <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging, significantly increased reporter macrophages were detected in femora of mice infused with UHMWPE, and these macrophages were positively stained for TRAP and were associated with increased bone destruction.

When OCPs were treated with RANKL and TNF-&#x003b1;, TNF-&#x003b1; was found to augment osteoclast differentiation in a dose-dependent manner. This synergistic effect was so powerful that 1&#x02009;ng&#x000b7;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of TNF-&#x003b1; was sufficient to potentiate osteoclast differentiation at RANKL doses &#x0003c;1% of that normally required for osteoclastogenesis.</p><p>Regarding mature osteoclasts, TNF-&#x003b1; activates osteoclasts independent of and similar in potency to RANKL, and also greatly augments RANKL-induced osteoclast activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref></sup> Fuller <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref></sup> treated osteoclasts harvested <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> with TNF-&#x003b1; and discovered a potent stimulation of actin ring formation (indicative of activation and bone resorptive capability) comparable to that induced by RANKL. When incubated with OPG, no inhibition of TNF-&#x003b1;-induced actin ring formation occurred, suggesting a RANKL-independent mechanism for osteoclast activation. Incubation with small amounts of TNF-&#x003b1; and RANKL exhibited a greatly synergistic response paralleling actin formation induced by RANKL alone at concentrations magnitudes higher. Lee <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref></sup> treated osteoclasts with various factors <italic>in vitro</italic> and found that TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, and RANKL promoted osteoclast survival. TNF-&#x003b1; inhibited apoptosis the strongest, and this inhibition was dependent on Akt and ERK phosphorylation. By enhancing osteoclast differentiation, activation, and survival often in concert with RANKL, TNF-&#x003b1; significantly contributes to the development of osteolysis.</p><p>IL-1 serves to collaborate with TNF-&#x003b1;. Wei <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that TNF-&#x003b1; increases IL-1 and IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) type I expression by murine marrow stromal cells, and that osteoclastogenesis induced by TNF-&#x003b1; was reduced ~50% with IL-1R antagonism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">60</xref></sup> Moreover, TNF-induced <italic>RANKL</italic> gene expression was blunted in IL-1R-deficient cells, an effect not seen in control cells treated with active vitamin D (known activator of <italic>RANKL</italic> gene). TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1 effects were mediated by p38-associated mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). In addition, Wei <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">60</xref></sup> incubated OCPs derived from wild-type and TNF receptor-deficient mice with and without RANKL to assess IL-1 function. No osteoclast differentiation occurred in cultures without RANKL. Contrastingly, cultures incubated with RANKL and increasing amounts of IL-1 demonstrated a dose-dependent differentiation of osteoclasts. TNF receptor knockout had no bearing on these results. Thus, in addition to mediating the effects of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1 is also capable of directly stimulating osteoclastogenesis in the presence of low levels of RANKL. IL-1R and IL-18R signaling have been reported to activate NF-&#x003ba;B and MAPK, paralleling these findings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref></sup> A conclusion to be drawn is that while TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1, and RANKL display cooperative synergism to promote osteoclast differentiation, they also maintain independence to mediate these proinflammatory effects. The result is a fail-safe mechanism in initiating an immune response, one that possesses the ability to sustain and propagate itself, as described in earlier sections.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Detection and diagnosis</title><p>Detection of osteolysis at stages early enough to implement intervention is challenging.

Inflammatory cells of monocytic lineage dominate pathogenesis of osteolysis, and therefore are the natural target for chemotherapy. Historically, the main barriers to implementation of effective therapy have been detecting disease at stages early enough for effective intervention and averting unwanted and significant systemic side effects. In theory, this can be accomplished by one of two methods: designing a drug without significant systemic side effects, or navigating a delivery mechanism that allows for localized and selective drug dissemination without systemic side effects. For example, a RANKL antagonist is currently in clinical trials for use in osteolysis, and this shows some promise in that it impacts immunocompetence less than originally thought.

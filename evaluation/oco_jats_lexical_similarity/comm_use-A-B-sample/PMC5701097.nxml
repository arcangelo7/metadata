mortality<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. Multiple
abnormalities have been suggested to contribute to predisposition for this disease,
mainly including hypertension, degeneration and genetic disorders<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. The natural incidence of AD was 0.5-3.2/100.000/yr<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>, and there are about more than 10 thousand new cases of AD each
year in China<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. Meszaros et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> reported that about
50% patients died within 24 hours and 68.2% within the first 2 days after admission.
Besides, the reporting cases of deaths due to aortic abnormalities including AD,
thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) have accelerated
more recently<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Traditional surgical management technique for aortic diseases such as AD and TAA is
surgical replacement with a prosthetic graft, whereas high postoperative
complications and mortality have been described. Parodi et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> firstly reported that endovascular
stent-graft treatment of AAA in 1991. Dake et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> used transluminally placed stent-grafts to treat
descending TAA in 13 patients over a 24-month period. Endovascular stent-graft is
capable of repairing various aortic abnormalities as well as maintaining blood flow
and declining the possibility of aortic rupture. Therefore, thoracic endovascular
aortic repair (TEVAR) by means of stent-graft has turned out to be a more attractive
option than conventional surgical approaches<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. However, TEVAR
may result in kinking, endoleak, infolding or even stent-graft migration.
Stent-graft disconformability and disattachment phenomena at the inner aortic arch
radius in juvenile trauma victims have received widespread attention<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>. Although enormous applications have been found in China,
most of stent-grafts for TEVAR come from import. Some Chinese patients cannot afford
such high medical fees, and the specifications of the commercially available
stent-grafts are unitary, which cannot satisfy the needs of complying with tapering
naturally vessel, leading to high rates of long-term complication of endovascular
stent-graft's distal end. Thus, it is urgent to independently develop a homegrown
stent-graft with various tapers. This evaluation work was carried out to primarily
evaluate the safety and feasibility of a novel thoracic aortic stent-graft designed
by a company in a canine model.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Compliance with Ethical Standards</title><p>All experimental procedures complied with the criteria in Guide for the Care and

nickel titanium alloy, polyethylene terephthalate and platinum-iridium alloy. It
has characteristics such as good bendability, compliance, adhesion of vessel
wall and low profile. The transportation system and delivery system are mainly
composed of Teflon, polycarbonate and stainless steel, resulting in higher
compliance. Moreover, the minimum size of transportation system is 14 F, while
general products' sizes are 6-8 F. In addition, the external sheath of
transportation system, merely 4.9 mm to 6.1 mm in diameter, can obviously reduce
the damage of blood vessel. The markers on stent-graft are used to ensure
accurate positioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>

Dogs were given antibiotics for 3 days, 12 hours of fasting and water
deprivation was carried out before surgery. The dogs were given a hypodermic
injection of atropine sulfate (0.01 mg/kg) and etamsylate (10 mg/kg),
respectively. Anesthesia was followed by intravenous propofol (6 mg/kg).</p><p>The diameter of thoracic aorta was evaluated through the femoral artery. The
heparin saline and contrast media were injected. And then, the loach guide wire
and the pigtail catheter were inserted via common femoral artery. The distal end
of the pigtail catheter should reach the position of ascending thoracic aorta.
Angiography was conducted to measure the diameter of thoracic aorta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). Afterwards, 260 cm in length with
curved super-stiff guide wire were sent to the specific location of aortic arch
via the pigtail catheter, and then the pigtail catheter and short needle sheath
were extracted. Subsequently, the stent-graft system was sent to the desired
position via the super-stiff guide wire. Finally, the stent-graft was unfolded
and affixed to the vascular wall when it reached the desired position.
Angiography was repeated to evaluate the effect of implantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>

to be a safe and effective treatment for various diseases of thoracic
aorta<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>. This technology has been widely applied in
China. The demand for stent-graft is on the increase due to the huge population of
patients in China who are suffering from aorta diseases. However, most of
stent-grafts in China rely on imports now. Moreover, it is difficult to afford the
medical fees for people because China is a developing country. Besides, the
specifications of these stent-grafts are unitary, which cannot satisfy the needs of
complying with tapering naturally vessel, leading to high rates of long-term
complication of endovascular stent-graft's distal end. It is urgent to independently
design an effective homegrown stent-graft, which has various tapers and can decline
the rates of long-term complication of endovascular stent-graft's distal end. The
stent-graft used in our study has good bendability, compliance, adhesion of vessel
wall and low profile, and can obviously reduce the damage of blood vessel, which
could solve the deficiencies in general products.</p><p>In this study, experimental animals were used to evaluate the safety and feasibility
of the stent-graft because it was convenient for real-time observation. Dogs (weight
25 to 35 kg) were adopted in this research, as the diameter of their artery and its
hemodynamics are approximate to human. Furthermore, their tolerance is strong enough
to survive long hours of anesthesia and surgery. Canine fibrinolytic system of is
more active than the human<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>,
and their mortality rate and postoperative complications are much lower than other
animals.</p><p>Aortic abnormalities such as AD and TAA are harmful diseases with high mortality in
emergencies. Endovascular stent-grafts not only could repair various aortic
abnormalities, but also maintain blood flow and decline the possibility of aortic
rupture. However, there were plenty of problems of early first-generation
stent-grafts, such as vascular injury, ascending aortic dissection or aortic
penetration from struts, stroke with insertion, graft collapse, endovascular leaks,
graft material failure, continued aneurysm expansion or rupture, and migration or
kinking<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>. Besides,
inflammation and rejection are also worth of concerning in complication. In this
study, the obvious increase of WBC counts at the first week after the implantation,
while there was no remarkable difference in other days, reflected inflammation
caused by surgery, which could also be demonstrated by the results of inflammation
factor. However, it had been improved significantly after using antibiotic. The
results of immunological indexes revealed that rejection was not obvious <italic>in
vivo</italic>. Some innovative studies on endovascular repair in animal model
have been conducted to study aortic diseases, but they were short-term
studies<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>. All dogs had stent-grafts implanted successfully
in this study. Focus should be attached to the materials of stent-graft in
implantation, as well as the importance of surgery itself. Multiple reasons have
been confirmed to contribute to fail, mainly including anesthesia, intubation
failure, hemorrhage, postoperative infection and improper nursing care.</p><p>In our study, the autopsy results showed that the stent-graft could fit the vessel
wall of thoracic aorta well. The formation of intima on the inner surface of the
bare stent and complete endothelialization of stent-graft surface were observed. The
histopathological results also showed that neointima had formed and adventitia
appeared essentially normal. The results demonstrated that the stent-graft had high
histocompatibility and sealability and had not induced inflammation and
calcification, which were consistent with majority relevant reports<sup>[<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>. Additionally, the experimental period was more than 2
years, so that the long-term dynamic changes could be distinctly observed, which
further demonstrated the safety of stent-graft.</p><p>In short, further research is still needed before final clinical application.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In the present study, the thoracic aortic stent-graft made in China was safe and

An integrated approach to the management of high-risk respiratory patients, incorporating specialist and primary care teams' expertise, is the basis for new integrated respiratory services designed to reduce this variation; however, this model needs evaluating.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>To evaluate an integrated service managing high-risk respiratory patients, electronic searches for patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at risk of poor outcomes were performed in two general practitioner (GP) practices in a local service-development initiative. Patients were reviewed at joint clinics by primary and secondary care professionals. GPs also nominated patients for inclusion. Reviews were delivered to best standards of care including assessments of diagnosis, control, spirometry, self-management, education, medication, inhaler technique and smoking cessation support. Follow-up of routine clinical data collected at 9-months postclinic were compared with seasonally matched 9-months prior to integrated review.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>82 patients were identified, 55 attended. 13 (23.6%) had their primary diagnosis changed. In comparison with the seasonally adjusted baseline period, in the 9-month follow-up there was an increase in inhaled corticosteroid prescriptions of 23.3%, a reduction in short-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist prescription of 33.3%, a reduction in acute respiratory exacerbations of 67.6%, in unscheduled GP surgery visits of 53.3% and acute respiratory hospital admissions reduced from 3 to 0.

<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> These patients often struggle to engage with the structured, proactive care approach to chronic disease management advocated for asthma and COPD, resulting in repeated emergency healthcare use of primary and secondary care.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> An integrated approach to the management of complex patients, incorporating specialist and primary care teams' expertise, may be effective in improving outcomes for such high-risk patients. However, the evidence is mixed<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;8</xref> and there is a need for evaluations of models of integrated care in routine, &#x02018;real-world&#x02019; clinical settings.</p><p>Over the past two decades, there has been a shift in the locus of care for the majority of patients with chronic respiratory diseases in the UK towards the community.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Respiratory diseases are among the most common causes of primary care consultations, accounting for 24 million consultations annually.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Increasing numbers of complex respiratory patients are being managed in the primary care setting by generalist teams, with a focus on avoidance of admissions to hospital.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Specialist secondary care is restricted to those patients admitted to hospital in a crisis or referred because of uncontrolled disease.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>There is evidence of significant and unwarranted variability in the standards of respiratory management in the primary and secondary care sectors. Marked variations in outcomes for patients with respiratory disease have also been shown, regionally and between individual general practitioner (GP) practices.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> There is evidence linking the quality of care provided in general practice with unplanned admissions to secondary care,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and decreased admission rates have been reported in a number of long-term conditions (including COPD and asthma) where GPs were financially incentivised to provide high-quality care.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Moreover, higher levels of professional education, nurse staffing and clinical recording in primary care are all associated with an improvement in the quality of clinical care for patients with COPD.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> However, a &#x02018;skills gap&#x02019; may exist in some primary care settings, where GPs and other healthcare professionals lack advanced training in the management of these common conditions, particularly in the case of patients with multimorbidity, uncertain diagnosis or complex problems.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Patients with more severe or complicated disease may receive suboptimal care, which may in turn lead to poor outcomes.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Such patients may fail to reach a specialist assessment that could potentially improve outcomes, either because they are not offered referral to a specialist clinic or because they decline going to a hospital clinic for such an assessment. Therefore, a community-based integrated care approach, harnessing specialist skills and the overall holistic perspective of the generalist primary care teams, is a promising and attractive solution which is being explored by newly commissioned services. Potential benefits of joint specialist&#x02013;generalist clinics in the community include not only improvement in quality of care for each of the individual patients seen, but also on-site education for the primary care teams, leaving a legacy of improved skills and greater confidence in managing complex disease.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Such clinics may potentially increase patient and staff satisfaction, reduce secondary care use and consequently reduce the financial burden of respiratory disease on the local health economy.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><sec id="s1a"><title>Local context</title><p>The UK region of Wessex is situated on the south coast of England and represents a diverse population of around 2.8 million people, ranging from inner city deprivation to remote rural populations. Local clinical audit data have demonstrated marked variation between local regional administrative groups (eg, a 1.9-fold difference in COPD admission rates and a 2.8-fold difference in asthma admission rates) and between individual GP practices (eg, a 4.7-fold difference in COPD admission rates). Improving respiratory care is an agreed local priority and the basis for newly commissioned integrated respiratory services. West Hampshire Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), the Wessex Academic Health Sciences Network (WAHSN) and the Wessex Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC) collaborated to prospectively evaluate a service pilot of an integrated model for managing complex or poorly controlled asthma and COPD across the organisational silos of primary and secondary care with a view to subsequent regional roll-out.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Setting</title><p>Two practices were enrolled in the pilot evaluation, one rural and one urban. Patients with poorly controlled COPD and asthma were identified by searches of the practice clinical computer systems, using routinely recorded clinical data.

Patients with poorly controlled asthma were identified based on clinical consensus and on at-risk factors identified by the UK National Review of Asthma Deaths (NRAD)<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> (shown in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1">box 1</xref>). Patients were identified through the use of electronic audit and case-finding tools and a manual review of routine patient records by respiratory nurse specialists (RNS). Clinically pertinent information on each patient was prepared in advance of the clinic including the number of exacerbations, hospital admissions and inhaler usage in the 12 months prior to the appointment. Additionally, clinical staff from the GP practice were able to include respiratory patients they considered &#x02018;at risk&#x02019; or for whom they required further advice or considered complex.

The practices agreed to provide administrative support which included facilitating electronic searches on their databases, sending out invitations to patients, booking patients into clinics and reminding patients of their appointment date and time, much of which is considered routine clinical practice. There were no financial incentives for the practices. Clinical and information governance arrangements were agreed: the specialist respiratory team was endorsed by the CCG as a guest of the surgeries and the clinical responsibility for the patients remained with the GP.

The model involved identification of patients with poor outcomes and their review in joint clinics delivered collaboratively by visiting specialist teams and the host primary care teams. This initiative was acceptable to patients and healthcare professionals, including members of the integrated care team. The project demonstrated that informatics approaches to identification of patients with poorly controlled respiratory disease and follow-up is possible and may be conducted using electronic searches of routine clinical data from medical records. Moreover, this intervention can improve both markers of efficient medication use such as improved adherence to preventer inhaled therapy and reduced use of rescue medication and in improved markers of clinical outcomes such as frequency of exacerbation and unscheduled primary care consultations. The health economics analysis demonstrates significant cost savings over usual respiratory care that may cover the additional costs of providing the service, although this will require confirmation in larger studies with a more rigorous health economic evaluation and longer follow-up periods.</p><p>The acceptability of the intervention to patients is not only demonstrated through the positive feedback but also by the high response and attendance levels. Some of the patients who attended had repeatedly failed to attend the practice for their routine asthma/COPD annual check-up, a risk factor for exacerbations and premature mortality.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The high level of attendance to the joint respiratory clinics suggests that patients may be more motivated to attend specialist respiratory clinics located in GP surgeries rather than, conventionally, at their local hospital thus potentially providing a more acceptable, efficient and cost-effective service. However, several issues remain&#x02014;more work is required to identify optimal mechanisms to identify patients with inadequate control and at greatest risk of poor outcome. Furthermore, work is required to address the real unmet need driven by frequent no-attenders to clinical review in routine primary care and in additional services such as this. This population similarly is not involved in current service evaluations and focused research in this group is needed.</p><p>The intervention resulted in a change in primary diagnosis for almost a quarter of the patients who attended the clinic. Improving diagnostic accuracy relied particularly on the provision of quality assured spirometry and where needed additional near-patient tests (eg, fraction of exhaled nitric oxide testing). Accurate diagnosis is fundamental to the appropriate provision of preventive therapy,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> enabling appropriate management tailored to each condition, for example, ICS in asthma and pulmonary rehabilitation in COPD, and may help to avoid treatment that is of no benefit or harmful.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The shift shown in prescription patterns after clinic review was to one more closely aligned with national guidelines for both COPD. The majority of patients had either a change in diagnosis and/or management made without the need for further input from secondary care, which demonstrates the practicability of this integrated care model in primary care.</p><p>Prevention of exacerbations is a key goal in improving control of COPD and asthma.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Furthermore, reducing hospital admissions has potential cost savings for the NHS. Emergency hospital admissions for ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSC) cost the NHS &#x000a3;1.42 billion annually; 34% of these are for respiratory-related disease.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The results from this project show a reduction in healthcare usage both in terms of exacerbations, hospital admissions and GP surgery attendance. A 68% reduction in exacerbations and 79% reduction in non-elective GP visits are particularly worthy of note and indicate better disease control. The health economic analysis demonstrated that there was a cost saving in terms of healthcare usage following the intervention. Further research with a longer follow-up period is needed to perform an analysis of whether the outcomes from the intervention, for example, reductions in healthcare usage, are sustainable and whether the model will have further cost savings long term as benefits continue to accrue. Further research will also require the collection of quality of life data in order to calculate the cost-effectiveness in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY).</p><p>This integrated model allowed for shared learning interorganisationally, between primary and secondary care, and intraorganisationally, within the multidisciplinary team. Furthermore, this initiative placed a strong emphasis on the importance of patient and carer education. The emphasis on education for patients, carers and healthcare professionals was intended to leave a legacy of patients who are able to self-manage more effectively and healthcare professionals who are upskilled in the management of patients with respiratory disease and more technically assured in performing specialist respiratory assessments.</p></sec><sec id="s5b"><title>Interpretation of findings in relation to previously published work</title><p>This project has demonstrated that this integrated model of care has the potential to improve outcomes for patients with complex respiratory conditions. This is supported by evidence from various NHS organisations including NHS England<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and the King's Fund,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> which suggest that ensuring specialist support in the delivery of care outside hospital has the potential to improve patient experience and access to care.</p></sec><sec id="s5c"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The benefits of this intervention in terms of improving patient outcomes and experience, access to care and reduction in healthcare usage were significant and have the potential to be replicated across the NHS, but require replication in large, well-designed trials. Formal research in a controlled setting (eg, an appropriately powered cluster randomised trial, comparing outcomes in matched practices receiving and not receiving the outreach intervention) is needed.</p><p>The intervention in this pilot was a complex and multifactorial one. Consequently, understanding which aspects of the process were key drivers to improvement in an individual is difficult to ascertain; this issue is exacerbated by the relatively small sample size and that patients with asthma and patients with COPD were reviewed. Future larger scale studies and more discrete interventions may be required to tease out relative benefits of diagnostic change from treatment alterations or improved adherence. A more pragmatic approach would be to improve the evidence base behind the improved delivery of guideline adherent care in an integrated team and hence to provide the rationale for commissioners to adopt this model at scale if proven to be cost-effective.</p><p>The limited sample size in this pilot restricts the power to detect significant change in hospital admissions, a major driver to costs in respiratory care. However, a reduction was observed, which will again need further investigation in larger controlled trials.</p></sec><sec id="s5d"><title>Implications for future research, policy and practice</title><p>Future research in a controlled environment to prove a causal relationship between this integrated respiratory care model and an improvement in respiratory outcomes in a cluster randomised trial is required. If validated this model will then have the potential to be replicated across the NHS and improve respiratory outcomes for patients throughout the UK.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s6"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A range of evidence demonstrates that the current reactive model predicated on acute hospitals is unsustainable in the face of an ageing population, with increasingly complex chronic conditions. This service-development evaluation demonstrates that patients with respiratory disease at risk of suboptimal outcomes can proactively be identified for management by an integrated team in the community without the need for extensive, expensive secondary care technologies and warrants further evaluation at scale to determine its impact in other regions to fully determine health economic outcomes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are thankful to the Wessex AHSN, Wessex CLAHRC, West Hampshire CCG and the patients and staff from the two GP surgeries involved who gave their time and supported this project.

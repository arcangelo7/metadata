to the heart. It is usually not diagnosed because of the absent/nonspecific
cardiac signs and symptoms. Herein, we present a case of a 41-year-old man
without any cardiovascular risk factor, admitted to the emergency room with
chest pain, diagnosed with a myocardial infarction. Due to the presence of a
mass adjacent to the mitral valve on the cardiac ultrasound examination, causing
mitral regurgitation, the patient was referred to surgery. Pathological analysis
of the excised specimens diagnosed the melanoma. The chemotherapy was started
and achieved a partial response. Cardiac metastases usually affect the
myocardium, leaving the valves unaffected. In this case, the acute coronary
syndrome was the first manifestation of the malignant melanoma. We highlight the
high level of suspicion needed in these cases.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Melanoma</kwd><kwd>Acute Coronary Syndrome</kwd><kwd>Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Melanoma is a tumor that arises from melanocytes or melanocyte precursors, and may
virtually involve any tissue in the body<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. It commonly metastasizes to the heart (40-45% of the
cases)<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>, but usually
cardiac involvement is only diagnosed post-mortem because of the absent or
nonspecific cardiac signs and symptoms<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Secondary cardiac lesions are up to 100 times more frequent
than primary tumors<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. Although
they usually tend to remain silent<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>, cardiac melanoma can cause serious mechanical
(<italic>e.g.</italic> limitation of blood flow through the cardiac chambers)
and electrical complications (usually associated with myocardial infiltrative
masses) and embolization of the tumor<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. In this article, we present a case of a patient admitted to
the hospital with chest pain and diagnosis of myocardial infarction, with a
ventricular mass identified. Histologic analysis after surgical resection revealed
an occult metastatic melanoma.</p></sec><sec><title>CASE REPORT</title><p>A 41-year-old man without any cardiovascular risk factor presented to the emergency
department with a 2-hour history of atypical chest pain. The patient had no history
of previous episodes, or any other sign or symptom. At the examination, his pulse
was arrhythmic at 125 beats/min. The electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation
and 5 mm-ST-segment elevation on the inferior derivations. Troponin T was 3628 ng/L.
The patient underwent immediate coronariography, and a thrombotic occlusion was
visualized in the right coronary artery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure
1A</xref>), which was treated with aspiration, percutaneous balloon and
abciximab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>). The thrombus was not
collected to histological analysis.</p><p>

after percutaneous treatment. C) Echocardiography showing a para-mitral
valve mass of 1.5 cm.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-32-03-0225-g01"/></fig>
</p><p>The echocardiogram showed hypokinesia of the inferior and posterior walls with normal
left ventricular function, and the presence of a 10 x 15 mm mass (assumed to be a
thrombus) adjacent to the mitral valve, causing mild to moderate mitral
regurgitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>). The mass was
unaltered with anticoagulation for 48 hours, so the patient was proposed to surgery.
The patient was transferred to the cardiothoracic surgery department and was
submitted to resection of the ventricular tumor. An 8 cm mini-thoracotomy was
performed on the right 5<sup>th</sup> intercostal space and peripheral cannulation
cardiopulmonary bypass was established. On the epicardial adipose tissue dark
lesions were observed and excised for pathology. After left atriotomy, a large (2 x
2 cm), round and solid mass adjacent to the papillary muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>) was causing mitral valve regurgitation. The mass was
excised, including a partial resection of a papillary muscle, and sent for
pathological examination. The mitral valve was surgically repaired with an
annuloplasty (32 mm-ring) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>). After
annuloplasty, no regurgitation was observed during intraoperative
echocardiogram.</p><p>

myocardium with immunohistochemistry for the HMB-45 antigen.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-32-03-0225-g02"/></fig>
</p><p>Pathological examination revealed that undifferentiated tumor cells infiltrated both
the papillary muscle and epicardial adipose tissue. The tumor cells were positive on
the immunocytochemistry to melan-A, vimentin, MITF and HMB45 (negative to CKAE1/AE3,
CK7, CK20, LCA, CD3, CD20, WT1 and calretinin), concluding that the tumor was a
melanoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>). The presence of the
BRAF-V600E mutation was detected.</p><p>The patient's postoperative course was uneventful. He was discharged on the fourth
postoperative day and referred to the oncology department. The patient underwent a
thoraco-abdominopelvic computed tomography, which revealed metastatic disease to the
lungs, liver, skin and lymph nodes. The patient started chemotherapy with
vemurafenib and cobimetinib, to which he remains with partial response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Although cardiac involvement in metastatic melanoma is frequent, symptomatic
presentations are rare<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Most
cases are not diagnosed <italic>antemortem</italic> due to the silent clinical
course<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Most metastasis are located in the myocardium and valvular structures are typically
unaffected<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. When
searching for a primary focus of the metastatic melanoma, mucosal (including genital
mucosal) and ophthalmologic examinations are essential and must not be
disregarded.</p><p>Few articles have been published reporting cardiac metastasis of malignant melanoma
with unknown primary origin. In this case, the acute coronary syndrome was its first
manifestation, since the patient had no history of previous mucosal and/or skin
lesions or surgery.</p><p>We highlight the essential high level of suspicion, since cardiac tumors should raise
the possibility of being a metastatic melanoma.</p><table-wrap id="t1" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="50%" span="1"/><col width="50%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TRV</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Substantial contributions to the conception or design

No immune rejection and risk of tumor was observed; however, further studies are required to confirm the clinical efficiency and safety profile of this capture system. Lastly, further research is needed on skin and cutaneous appendages regeneration. Taken together, these data provided new insights for the treatment of acute full-thickness wounds by cellular-material therapy and should contribute to new strategies for the treatment of chronic wounds and ischemic diseases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this work, collagen scaffolds that were functionalized with a peptide with a specific affinity for MSCs were used in a porcine wound-healing model. After implantation at the injured skin, the functional scaffold effectively enhanced the recruitment of MSCs, accelerated the healing rate and promoted neovascularization. This study provided new insights for enriching autologous stem cells to the wound site and contributed to new methods for the treatment of wound healing.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec16"><title>&#x0201c;Quick Response Code&#x0201d; Link for Full Text Artiles</title><p>The journal provides an easy and cool way to reaching to the journal&#x02019;s website.

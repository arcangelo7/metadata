Progress in our understanding of adult neovascularization further suggests the potential of ASCs in promoting vascular regeneration, although the specific cues that stimulate their angiogenic behavior remain controversial. In this study, we established a three-dimensional (3D) angiogenesis model by co-culturing ASCs and endothelial cells (ECs) in collagen gel and found that ASC-EC-instructed angiogenesis was regulated by the canonical Wnt pathway. Furthermore, the angiogenesis that occurred in implants collected after injections of our collagen gel-based 3D angiogenesis model into nude mice was confirmed to be functional and also regulated by the canonical Wnt pathway. Wnt regulation of angiogenesis involving changes in vessel length, vessel density, vessel sprout, and connection numbers occurred in our system. Wnt signaling was then shown to regulate ASC-mediated paracrine signaling during angiogenesis through the nuclear translocation of &#x003b2;-catenin after its cytoplasmic accumulation in both ASCs and ECs. This translocation enhanced the expression of nuclear co-factor Lef-1 and cyclin D1 and activated the angiogenic transcription of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). The angiogenesis process in the 3D collagen model appeared to follow canonical Wnt signaling, and this model can help us understand the importance of the canonical Wnt pathway in the use of ASCs in vascular regeneration.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs) are believed to have great potential in vascular regeneration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> The advantages of ASCs include a less invasive harvesting procedure, a larger number of stem cell progenitors from an equivalent amount of harvested tissue, better angiogenic, osteogenic, and adipogenic properties, and better immunomodulatory properties, which make ASCs a promising alternative to multi-functional bone mesenchymal stem cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> Recent studies in vascular regeneration has shown that ASCs promote endothelial tubulogenesis, contribute to neovascularization, and impact angiogenesis by secreting angiogenic cytokines and growth factors in a paracrine manner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> ASCs showed a promising angiogenic effect in transplantations <italic>in vivo</italic> and in early clinical trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these biological events are still heavily debated.</p><p>Multiple cell types involved in the regulation of angiogenesis express Wnt ligands.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> Animal models utlizing transgenic mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> and tumor angiogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> also implicate autocrine Wnt signaling as a vital regulator of angiogenesis. In addition to expressing Wnt ligands, vascular cells also respond to Wnt signaling via the canonical pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> Recently, the canonical Wnt pathway has been implicated in many aspects of angiogenesis, vascular remodeling, and differentiation; it also influences vascular sprouting, network maturation, and arterio-venous specification through cell&#x02013;cell interactions to consequently determine different cell fates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> Although &#x003b2;-catenin-dependent Wnt signaling has been shown to regulate angiogenesis, the contribution of individual cell types in the activation of downstream cascade reactions in both endothelial cells (ECs) and themselves during blood vessel formation is still elusive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup></p><p>Lithium chloride (LiCl) is a canonical activator of Wnt signaling. Activation of the canonical Wnt pathway inhibits glycogen synthase kinase-3&#x003b2; from phosphorylating &#x003b2;-catenin, resulting in the accumulation of active &#x003b2;-catenin polypeptide species that translocate into the nucleus to activate transcription factors, such as Tcf/Lef.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> However, dickkopf-1 (DKK1) is a classic Wnt antagonist that binds to the Wnt receptors low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins 5 and 6 (LRP5/6), which thereby inhibits the formation of a ternary receptor complex to block &#x003b2;-catenin signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> In addition to binding to LRP5/6, DKK1 also binds to Kremen (Krm)-1/2 with high affinity to inhibit Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup></p><p>Therefore, in the present study, we first established a three-dimensional (3D) collagen gel model and co-cultured ASCs and ECs to investigate whether angiogenesis was regulated by the canonical Wnt pathway. We applied LiCl and DKK1 in the co-culture system to further explore the influence of the Wnt pathway on the cellular mechanism of angiogenesis in both targeted ECs and paracrine ASCs. Identifying the contribution of individual cell types helps us understand the influence of the canonical Wnt pathway on ASCs in vascular regeneration.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Animal materials used for this study were obtained according to governing ethical principles, and approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the West China Hospital of Stomatology was obtained prior to commencing this study.</p><sec><title>Transgenic mice and cell culture</title><p>Transgenic mice (C57BL/6-Tg(CAG-EGFP)1Osb/J) that use the chicken &#x003b2;-actin promoter to direct the expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) were provided by the Center of Genetically Engineered Mice, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.

Primary ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>) were used in the experiments for angiogenesis, and factor VIII immunofluorescence confirmed positive endothelial cell markers in isolated ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). We then mixed GFP-ASCs and RPF-ECs at a 1:1 ratio in a collagen gel and cultured the gel <italic>in vitro</italic> in a 96-well plate for 14 days. Particularly at 7 days, the co-cultured group formed vessel-like structures observed by enhanced inverted microscope, but the single ASC or EC group did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Three-dimensional images of the collagen gels were reconstructed from 20-layer scanning images by Imaris 7.0.0 to better show the vessel-like structure formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). We found that more vessel-like structures formed at 14 days in comparison to angiogenesis at 7 days after co-culturing ASCs and ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). The diameter of vessel-like structures showed no significant differences at 14 days compared to those at 7 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>); however, after 14 days, the single vessel length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>), vessel density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>), sprout number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>), and connection number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>) were all increased to 155%, 192%, 180%, and 360%, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>ASC-paracrine angiogenesis is regulated by the canonical Wnt pathway</title><p>ASCs and ECs were co-cultured in 3D collagen gels with LiCl (11.794&#x02009;mmol&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, 0.5&#x02009;mg&#x000b7;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), DKK1 (100&#x02009;ng&#x000b7;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), or PBS (the blank control group).

Compared with the blank co-culture group, LiCl increased the number of extended branches and vessel-like structures that protruded from the ECs at 7 days. However, DKK1 could not induce the formation of these structures, and most ECs remained as single cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). The densities of vessel-like structures increased with LiCl treatment at 14 days, which caused the endothelial cells to extend their branches to connect with one another and form advanced vessel-like structural networks; however, as with the DKK1-treated group, cells did not form connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). The collagen gels were taken out from the 96-well plate and the angiogenesis images were captured by modified confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) to obtain further convincing evidence of angiogenesis.

From H&#x00026;E staining at 7 and 14 days, we found that red blood cells were observed in these newly formed capillaries in all groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>), meaning that this ASC-paracrine angiogenesis was functional.

We used another marker, CD34, and further confirmed that these vessel structures originated from the implanted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>).

After 7 and 14 days of co-culture, we first detected the total protein expression of &#x003b2;-catenin and phosphorylated &#x003b2;-catenin in HUVECs and hASCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). We found that LiCl significantly increased total &#x003b2;-catenin accumulation.

We further examined the VEGF gene expression profile regulated by this cascade reaction caused by &#x003b2;-catenin nuclear translocation. We found that the VEGFA gene increased in the LiCl group and decreased in the DKK1 group, but VEGFB, C, and D did not significantly change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). Quantitative real-time PCR confirmed that the VEGFA gene increased to 247% in HUVECs and 181% in hASCs at 14 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>).

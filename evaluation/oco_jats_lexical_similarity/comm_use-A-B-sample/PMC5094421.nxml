that occurs in denuded arteries, arterialized veins, and in the anastomoses of prostheses
used as grafts for bypass; it is also defined as an abnormal migration and proliferation of
smooth vascular muscle cells associated with the deposition of extracellular connective
tissue matrix, which is then accompanied by remodeling of the new tissue<sup>[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Intimal hyperplasia has been recognized as a complication of arterial reconstructions since
1906<sup>[<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. The biology of intimal
hyperplasia has many of the characteristic features of wounds, <italic>e.g.</italic>, the
inflammation process<sup>[<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>There is a great need for ways to prevent or reverse intimal hyperplasia. The myointimal
hyperplasia is reported to be reversible only in the first and second weeks after vascular
injury<sup>[<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>, and it depends on the degree
and duration of the causative injury<sup>[<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>On the basis of the studies available in the literature<sup>[<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>, we found that <italic>Allium
sativum</italic> has beneficial effects such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant,
hypocholesterolemic, antitumoral, and anti-atherosclerotic actions, which prompted us to
test its protective effect against myointimal hyperplasia. Our aim is to determine the mean
difference of post-angioplasty myointimal hyperplasia in the external iliac artery of
rabbits with induced atherosclerosis and treated with <italic>A. sativum</italic> compared
with those treated with cilostazol, since the articles found in the literature<sup>[<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>
demonstrate that cilostazol has effects of reducing the total cholesterol, triglyceride and
phospholipids in serum, and moreover, the triglyceride content in the atherosclerotic
arteries, so cilostazol significantly reduced the intimal atherosclerotic area.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>This study was approved by the research ethics committee of the State University of Health
Sciences of Alagoas (UNCISAL), Macei&#x000f3;, AL, Brazil, under number 63-A.</p><p>This is an experimental study<sup>[<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> in
laboratory animals for 35 days, including 30 adult female New Zealand rabbits
(<italic>Oryctolagus cuniculus</italic>; &#x0003e; 4 months old, &#x0003e;2 kg body weight). The
animals were equally divided into 3 groups: PS group (physiological saline solution,
negative control), group C (cilostazol, positive control), and group A (<italic>A.
sativum</italic>, study drug).</p><p>The animals were underwent to experimental atherosclerosis and submitted to induction of
myointimal hyperplasia in the right external iliac artery by angioplasty<sup>[<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The exclusion criteria were as follows:</p><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Older than 6 months;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Animals that have acquired some disease in the quarantine period;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Anatomical changes of the studied structures found during the angioplasty.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The selected rabbits comprised a nonprobability sample of convenience. The animals were
grouped by using simple randomization with the help of a free research randomizer program
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomizer.org/form.htm">http://www.randomizer.org/form.htm</ext-link>), by using three blocks containing 10
numbers each. Each block corresponded to the drug used, and the numbers generated
corresponded to the animals. Thus, each animal was assigned a letter and a number
corresponding to the group and animal identification (<italic>e.g.</italic>, C1=animal 1,
cilostazol group; A2=animal 2, <italic>A. sativum</italic> group). This identification was
written with indelible blue ink on the inside face of the base of the right ear of the
animals.</p><p>We opted for closed animal handling, and the trial was performed in the animal house of
origin, under a forced exhaust ventilation system, with periods of natural luminescence,
mean temperature of 20&#x000ba;C, minimum noise, and humidity of around 50%. The animals were kept
in appropriate cages with an area of 0.64 m<sup>2</sup>; they had no contact with their
natural secretions. The diet consisted of water and granulated commercial diet
(Purina<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> for rabbits&#x02014;15% crude protein, 2.5% ethereal extract, 16% fiber
material, 10% ash, 2.5% calcium, 0.42% phosphorus, 13% humidity, 31.58% carbohydrates) given
<italic>ad libitum</italic> before and during the experiment.</p><p>The rabbits were weighed weekly for the assessment of their nutritional status.</p><p>The following laws were followed in this study:</p><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Law 6638, May 8, 1979&#x02014;Standards for Educational and Scientific Practice of Animal

morning with the aid of a 20 mL syringe, for a period of 100 days<sup>[<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>. The diet was prepared daily, and proper hygiene was
maintained to prevent contamination; the diet was given raw.</p><p>After 100 days of administration of the atherogenic diet, it was stopped and myointimal
hyperplasia was induced by means of the following technique: rabbits were weighed and
anesthetized with 10 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> xylazine and 40 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> ketamine,
intramuscularly, on the proximal side to the right hindpaw, according to a technique
described in the literature<sup>[<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Anesthesia was verified by the absence of pain reflex in the direct interdigital hold in
the right ear. After anesthetic induction, trichotomy was performed in the lower abdomen and
right inguinal region, followed by proper cleaning of the area, under aseptic conditions and
antisepsis with polyvinyl pyrrolidone iodine degerming solution with 10% active iodine.</p><p>We collected 5 mL blood from the central ear vein with a syringe, to 6-mL tubes with a
suitable preservative for biochemical analysis. After collection, the samples were sent for
testing in the analysis laboratory of the Hospital University Lauro Wanderley at the Federal
University of Para&#x000ed;ba (UFPB), where they were centrifuged and the low density
lipoprotein (LDL), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), triglycerides, high density
lipoprotein (HDL), and total cholesterol levels were analyzed. Subsequently, a 2&#x02013;3-cm skin
incision was made in the longitudinal direction in the inguinal fold with scalpel blade
(#11) to expose the femoral artery, which was isolated with a 3-0 cotton thread. A small
transverse arteriotomy was performed with a scalpel blade (#11) for the introduction of a
0.014-in metal guidewire and a semi-compliant catheter balloon (2.5 mm diameter and 20 mm
long; balloon/artery ratio, 2.5:1), which was inserted in the lumen of the femoral right
artery in the cranial direction and its position in the right external iliac artery was
determined through visualization of the proximal balloon shoulder to the dissected inguinal
ligament. The balloon catheter was inflated for 1 min until the rated burst pressure (RBP)
of the angioplasty balloon (about 12 atm), leading to distension of the arterial wall. After
balloon deflation and removal of all guidewire balloons, we performed ligation with a 3-0
cotton thread above and below the arteriotomy. Finally, the skin was sutured with a 4-0
nylon thread. Analgesics (10 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> ibuprofen orally, diluted in drinking water
for 2 days) and antibiotics (20 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> ceftriaxone, intramuscular, single dose)
were administered to all groups in the postoperative period, to prevent animal suffering.
Twentyfour hours after surgery, the drug administration began in each group<sup>[<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Group A (<italic>A. sativum</italic>) received 800 &#x000b5;kg<sup>-1</sup>.day<sup>-1</sup>
of <italic>A. sativum</italic><sup>[<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> by garage (the garlic was crushed and mixed
with drinking water to a total volume of 10 mL) for 5 weeks, the PS group (negative control)
received 0.9% physiological saline by gavage 10 mL.day<sup>-1</sup> for 5 weeks and group C
(cilostazol) received cilostazol (ZHENJIANG Haisen, China) at a dose of 50
mg.day<sup>-1</sup><sup>[<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> for 5 weeks by
gavage (cilostazol was diluted in 10 mL drinking water).</p><p>The drugs were administered during a 5-week period, ending when the animals were
anesthetized by using the abovedescribed technique, and new blood samples were collected for
post-dose drug lipid profile analysis. The animals were euthanized with a lethal dose of an
anesthetic (150 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> pentobarbital<sup>[<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>. The right external iliac
artery, which received balloon injury due to the surgical procedure, was collected
transabdominally.</p><p>Arterial blocks were fixed in 10% formalin for at least 24 h and then prepared for routine
light microscopy, as follows: gradual and increasing dehydration with 70% alcohol until
absolute alcohol concentration was reached; diaphonization in xylene and liquid paraffin
embedding at 60&#x000b0;C; and preparation of paraffin blocks. The paraffin blocks were cut with a
microtome in a thickness of 3 &#x000b5;m, and the sections were mounted on extrafine glass
slides (76&#x000b4; 25 mm). Next, they were stained with hematoxylineosin for general morphology
study<sup>[<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>; Verhoeff's stain for the
evaluation of elastic fibers; and Masson's trichrome stain for general morphological study
and characterization of elastic fibers, collagen, and muscle. Then, they were mounted with
coverslips and natural resin. Also, immunohistochemistry assays were performed with the
monoclonal HHF35 antibody<sup>[<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>
(Kit DAKO Monoclonal Mouse anti-human Muscle Actin, clone HHF35) for determining the
invasive reactions in the artery layers (smooth muscle), and C4d<sup>[<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> (Kit Spring
Bioscience Rabbit Antihuman C4d Polyclonal antibody) to study the immune response in the
vascular endothelium; in both immunohistochemistry tests, peroxidase was used as a
developer. The slides were prepared and examined under magnifications of 2.5&#x000b4;, 10&#x000b4;, and 40&#x000b4;
by a duly accredited pathologist.</p><p>For morphometry, a Bioval<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> optical microscope was used, with the program
ToupTekView<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> version &#x000b4;86 3.7.2270 (copyright 2003&#x02013;2013; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.touptek.com">http://www.touptek.com</ext-link>)
and the Opticam<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 14 MP digital camera. The percentage of myointimal area
was calculated by using the ImageJ 64 program, where the image of the vessel was formatted
as follows:</p><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The area of the vessel adventitia was manually removed externally bypassing the
muscle layer, which is easily visible. The automatic deletion was cutting structures
of the muscle layer when some areas of adventitia had the same or similar color
intensity that the middle layer (muscle);</p></list-item><list-item><p>The remaining image was transformed into 8-bit;</p></list-item><list-item><p>The rest of the image formed by the lumen of the vessel and myointimal layer was
transformed into a mask, and the area in pixels was measured; this area was called the
total area;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Then, only the area of the vessel lumen was measured;</p></list-item><list-item><p>The area of myointimal layer was calculated in pixels by subtracting the light area
from the total area (area of the mean-intima layer with light);</p></list-item><list-item><p>The percentage was then calculated by dividing the area of the myointimal layer by
the total area.</p></list-item></list></p><p>For stereoscopy of the immunohistochemical results (monoclonal antibody HHF35 and C4d), we
took three random field photos by using the 40X objective of microscope, and with each
histological slide of each animal in each group. These photos do not suffer any further
increase in its size. Then, the 36-point test<sup>[<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> was used, in which the area of immunomarkers was calculated by using the
formula:</p><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>A = Vv/2Qa &#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup></p></list-item><list-item><p>where Vv (volume density of the immunomarker) was estimated by counting the points
(36-point test).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Vv = Pp/Pt</p></list-item><list-item><p>where Pp is the number of points that touch the immunomarkers, and Pt is the total
number of points in the test area of 200 &#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup>, which in our case was
36 points.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Qa (number density of nuclei area) was calculated by the formula</p></list-item><list-item><p>Qa = N/At</p></list-item><list-item><p>where N is the number of nuclei counted in the test area and At is our test area,
which was 200 &#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup>.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Masking for microscopy was performed by changing the letter and the initial marking number
with another letter and number known only to the principal investigator. The new description
was stored in an opaque and sealed envelope, which was only opened at the time of data
analysis. The pathologists did not know which method was being used in the target
vessel.</p><p>The sample size was arbitrated within thirty rabbits, 10 (ten) for each group studied;
since in the literature there are studies that prove acceptable statistical results with
fewer animals in the experiment with similar animal model<sup>[<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>We also measured the sample size using the online calculator LEE (Epidemiology and
Statistics Laboratory), available for free on the website: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lee.dante.br/pesquisa/amostragem/di_1_pro_tes.html">http://www.lee.dante.br/pesquisa/amostragem/di_1_pro_tes.html</ext-link>, which resulted
in n = 9 (nine) for each group. To calculate the hypothesis test for a proportion the

data and the Chi-square test for qualitative data, both with two-tailed hypothesis. Where
the two-way analysis of variance test was used for continuous temporal variables and the
one-way test was used for transverse continuous variables. Furthermore, the Tukey test was
used for quantitative data (continuous variables) because there was more than one group with

(<italic>A. sativum</italic>) were similar to those obtained in the positive control
(cilostazol), but differed from those obtained in the negative control (0.9% physiological
saline solution). However, the tested drug had no effect on the inhibition of myointimal
hyperplasia, since the result obtained was the same as the positive control.</p><p><italic>A. sativum</italic> was chosen as the target drug in the study to inhibit
myointimal hyperplasia because, according to Efendy et al.<sup>[<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>, Campbell et al.<sup>[<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> and Yamaji et al.<sup>[<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>, it
has an anti-atherosclerotic effect. Moreover, according to Lau<sup>[<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>, <italic>A. sativum</italic> has a hypocholesterolemic effect;
furthermore, Borek<sup>[<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> reported that it has
antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects. Hence, there was a great possibility
that <italic>A. sativum</italic> would act favorably in the inhibition of myointimal
hyperplasia. The dose of 800 &#x000b5;g.kg<sup>-1</sup>.day<sup>-1</sup> was chosen as the
test dose in the present study, as Efendy et al.<sup>[<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> reported that 800 &#x000b5;g.kg<sup>-1</sup>.day<sup>-1</sup> of crude
extract of garlic can inhibit the development of fat layers and the accumulation of
cholesterol in the vessel walls, thus protecting them against the development of
atherosclerosis. The use of <italic>A. sativum</italic> in its original form as based on the
study by Borek<sup>[<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>, who found that allicin&#x02014;a
component of <italic>A. sativum</italic> &#x02014; is unstable in solution, as it is a
lipid-soluble, volatile organosulfur compound. Thus, it is essential that the maximum
possible amount of the active substances of <italic>A. sativum</italic> is retained.</p><p>Rabbits were chosen for the study because, according to research performed by Ferrer et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup>, the rabbit is a valid
atherogenic vascular injury model. Takagi et al.<sup>[<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> proved that the hyperplasia occurring in rabbits is similar to that
occurring in human coronary arteries, besides Yl&#x000e3;-Herttuala et al.<sup>[<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> demonstrated that both rabbits and humans
have a common pattern of inflammatory reactions in the complement system.</p><p>In particular, female rabbits were chosen because according to the literature, there is no
difference in the use of female and male rabbits for this type of study<sup>[<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Egg yolk was chosen to induce atherosclerosis in female rabbits because Santos<sup>[<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> have demonstrated that this is a cheap and
effective method.</p><p>The balloon diameter used was safe and effective, according to Ferrer et al.<sup>[<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup>, Gellman et al.<sup>[<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>, and other researchers<sup>[<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The immunohistochemical study of specimens was performed with monoclonal HHF35<sup>[<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> and polyclonal C4d<sup>[<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> in an attempt to
establish the mechanism of action of the drugs, given that the former is a marker for muscle
cells and the C4d is a marker for the inflammatory process mediated by the complement
system. Yl&#x000e4;-Herttuala et al.<sup>[<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup>
demonstrated the action of the complement system in atherosclerotic lesions and Tsai et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> identified the inhibitory
activity of p38 by using cilostazol. Since the inhibition of p38 has been associated with
possible therapeutic effects on autoimmune diseases and inflammatory processes<sup>[<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup>, we chose to assess the effect of <italic>A.
sativum</italic> on inflammation through the complement system; then we used the marker
C4d. However, in all animals, no statistical difference was observed with regard to muscle
invasion in the intima as well as the inflammatory process mediated by the complement system
in the myointimal wall. Therefore, the study was not able to characterize the manner in
which the inhibition or decrease of myointimal hyperplasia occurred, given that there was no
statistically significant inhibition of muscle invasion or reduction of the inflammatory
process, with the use of <italic>A. sativum</italic> or cilostazol.</p><p>In the morphometric analysis, there was no pattern of hyperplasia among the groups because
some animals had hyperplasia of the muscle layer with breakdown of muscle cells and calcium
deposition; others only had a change of intima such as stratification of the intimal layer
and muscle invasion; and others showed change in two layers, suggesting that there are
various mechanisms underlying the development of myointimal hyperplasia, even though there
were only two induction mechanisms &#x02014; the hypercholesterolemic diet and endothelial injury
(balloon). However, these findings are in contrast with those from the literature, which
states that the distribution of hyperplasia may be intimal, diffuse, focal, or within the
body vessel. Furthermore, Van Craeyveld et al.<sup>[<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> found that the main changes of atherosclerosis and hyperplasia
actually occur in the deep layers of the vessel (muscle) and not in the intima. The staining
method of Verhoeff, which is used for elastic fibers, was performed to try to define the
intima and the muscle of vessel to calculate only the intimal hyperplasia; however, it was
not effective in this delimitation. Therefore, we studied the myointimal layer.</p><p><italic>A. sativum</italic> and cilostazol were able to inhibit myointimal hyperplasia in
40.9% and 54.64% of animals, respectively, as compared to the negative control (0.9%
physiological saline solution), demonstrating the effectiveness of both substances. Although
the proportion of animals exhibiting myointimal hyperplasia inhibition was 13.74% higher
with cilostazol than with <italic>A. sativum</italic>, the fact that cilostazol is a drug
that is already the active ingredient should be considered. Thus, even though a plant in its
original form was used, without isolation of the active principle, a statistically similar
result was obtained.</p><p><italic>A. sativum</italic> and cilostazol were not able to reduce the lipid levels, thus
our results are consistent with the current findings<sup>[<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> and we did not observe a difference in the lipid levels following in
the dose of 800 &#x000b5;g.kg<sup>-1</sup>.day<sup>-1</sup> in rabbits. Others
studies<sup>[<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> indicated that the hypolipidemic action of garlic was observed only
after 2 to 6 months of continuous administration of <italic>A. sativum</italic>, thus
suggesting that the time used to conduct this study (35 days) was not sufficient to observe
such a hypolipidemic effect, which was also reported by Ried et al.<sup>[<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>With regard to the safety of <italic>A. sativum</italic>, the use of this drug in animals
for the inhibition of myointimal hyperplasia was successful, without any difference in the
presence of steatosis, cholangitis, and portal infiltration between groups. <italic>A.
sativum</italic> has a LD50 of 3034 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> and maximum dosage without side
effects of 2200 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup><sup>[<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup>;
moreover, it is not contraindicated in pregnant animals<sup>[<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The research carried out in this study paves the way for a new drug against myointimal
hyperplasia, which is the main cause of failure of both coronary as well as peripheral
angioplasties that lead to reinfarctions and failure of vascular grafts, and consequently to

Both programmes consisted of daily, progressive home exercise for 12 weeks with 8 individual physiotherapy sessions over the trial period. The primary outcome measure was the Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Gluteal (VISA-G) and secondary outcome measures included the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (0&#x02013;10) and an 11-point Global Rating of Change Scale. Outcome measures were assessed at baseline, 4 and 12 weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Twenty-three participants completed the trial.

In one study, a 12-week programme of hip stretching and strengthening exercises was compared with shock wave therapy and a corticosteroid injection.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Exercise was shown to be less effective after 1&#x02009;month, but more beneficial at 15 months. Recently, a progressive lower limb exercise programme for the gluteal, quadriceps and calf muscles was compared with sham exercise in postmenopausal females with GTPS. Both groups also received education and similar improvements were observed at 52 weeks.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> A randomised controlled trial of 204 participants with gluteal tendinopathy found that education plus a progressive exercise programme targeting the gluteal muscles was superior to both a corticosteroid injection and &#x02018;wait and see&#x02019; approach at 8 and 52 weeks.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Isometric exercises have gained popularity in recent years in the management of other lower limb tendinopathies.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> An isometric exercise programme was compared with an isotonic programme in Australian volleyball and basketball players with patella tendinopathy.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Both programmes were equally effective after 4 weeks in reducing pain and improving function, possibly indicating that the specific muscle contraction type may be less important than the loading intensity. Furthermore, a systematic review examining tendon adaptation in response to exercise concluded that loading magnitude and muscle contraction intensity was more important than muscle contraction type.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Exercise is currently the first-line treatment for tendinopathy and at least 12 weeks of progressive loading is recommended.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> However, a recent review noted the lack of consensus around exercise and rehabilitation protocols for GTPS.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Isometric and isotonic exercise programmes have not been directly compared for GTPS and it is unclear whether the improvements observed in other lower limb tendinopathies could be replicated in GTPS.</p><p>This is the first trial to compare isometric exercise with isotonic exercise, with similar magnitude of load for individuals with GTPS. Our primary aim was to evaluate and compare the outcomes for individuals with GTPS who complete a 12-week exercise programme of either progressive isometric or progressive isotonic exercises. Thus, the null hypothesis was that there would be no difference in our primary end point (Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Gluteal (VISA-G)) between the groups performing isometric and isotonic exercise at 12 weeks.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Method</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>This pilot randomised controlled trial compared 12 weeks of daily, progressive home-based isometric exercise with 12 weeks of daily, progressive home-based isotonic exercise for patients with greater trochanteric pain syndrome.

No external resistance was used initially, but progressive muscle and tendon loading was achieved through the introduction of progressive therapeutic elastic bands ranging from low to high resistance, which induce higher levels of muscle activity and tendon loading. Exercise progression with the resistance bands was individualised and based on each participant&#x02019;s ability to complete the exercises without increasing their pain beyond 5/10. All bands were 100&#x02009;cm in length and were attached around both ankles.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Isometric exercise programme</title><p>The isometric exercise programme consisted of two exercises (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2A</xref> and Supplementary Figure 1). The hip abduction hold (i) was completed while lying on the non-affected side with pillows between both knees. The affected hip was abducted to approximately 30 degrees in mid-line abduction and held for 30&#x02009;s while maintaining knee extension. This was completed six times with 60&#x02009;s rest between each repetition. During the weight-bearing gluteal contraction exercise (ii), the participant while holding onto a wall or chair for support, moved the unaffected hip through abduction/adduction to the count of 6&#x02009;s, achieving an isometric gluteal contraction of the weight-bearing leg. Three sets of 10 repetitions were completed with 60&#x02009;s rest between each set.

Side-lying hip abduction (iii) was completed while lying on the non-affected side with pillows between both knees.

The hip abduction slide (iv) is similar to an exercise used in a recent study.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> It was completed in upright standing with both hands supported on a chair or table. The affected leg moved into hip abduction while keeping the foot in contact with the floor and maintaining knee extension. The non-affected hip and knee could bend to around 45 degrees. The foot then slides back into the starting position. Both exercises were completed for 3 sets of 10 repetitions with 60&#x02009;s rest between each set. Each repetition was 6&#x02009;s duration (3&#x02009;s concentric, 3&#x02009;s eccentric). TUT was 6&#x02009;min daily.</p><p>All participants attended eight individual physiotherapy appointments during the 12-week programme. All sessions were with the chief investigator, a physiotherapist with 11 years of clinical experience with musculoskeletal disorders and a postgraduate master degree-level qualification. During the first appointment, participants were given the opportunity to practice their exercise programme under supervision of the chief investigator to ensure correct technique. Following this, participants attended weekly for the next 2&#x02009;weeks and thereafter for a further five sessions over the next 10 weeks to ensure correct exercise technique and for exercise progression. Postural education and advice on positions that could be used to reduce pain during daily activities were also given. An illustrated instructional exercise booklet was provided. A daily exercise diary was used to monitor exercise adherence and to record the number of repetitions completed and the maximum pain score elicited during the exercise protocols. Simple analgesia was permitted, but participants were asked to refrain from seeking other forms of treatment during the study. Participants were also encouraged to remain physically active within their limits of pain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Outcomes</title><p>Outcome measures were assessed at baseline, 4 and 12 weeks.

Both groups showed similar improvements over a number of outcomes when compared at both 4 and 12 weeks. We found that mean VISA-G scores improved by just over 10 points in both groups by the end of the study. The MCID for the VISA-G has yet to be determined so it is unclear if these improvements are clinically significant. The percentage of participants who reported a reduction in pain of at least 2 points (MCID) on the NPRS was similar between groups at 12 weeks. For GROC, there were equal improvements in both groups at 4 weeks, with both groups demonstrating further increases in the number of participants reporting an MCID of 2 points at 12 weeks. This was more apparent in the isotonic group with a higher percentage reporting a clinically important change. Small improvements were seen in both groups for pain catastrophising, but only one participant in each group had a score of &#x0003e;30 at baseline suggesting that catastrophising is uncommon in this patient population. Improvements for both groups were found across all domains of the HOOS. No meaningful differences were detected for physical activity and health status when measured by the EQ-5D-5L and IPAQ-SF, respectively, which is unsurprising given the relatively short intervention period and follow-up. This may be due to the study not been sufficiently powered to detect changes in these measures.</p><p>Only a small number of studies have investigated isometric exercise in lower limb tendinopathy with mixed reported benefits on pain outcomes.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32&#x02013;36</xref> The current findings support previous results in athletes with patella tendinopathy,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> where no differences in pain or VISA-G scores were found after a 4-week exercise programme of isometric or isotonic exercise. In the present study, both groups were similar when compared at 12 weeks. In both studies, isometric and isotonic groups were matched for TUT and muscle contraction type, although our study used 30&#x02009;s contractions compared with 45&#x02009;s. Hip abductor weakness is known to be present in patients with GTPS,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> and in clinical practice patients are often unable to maintain an isometric hip abduction contraction for 45&#x02009;s in side-lying due to pain or strength deficits. However, isometric contractions sustained for 30&#x02009;s were well tolerated by participants during our study. Regardless, the duration of the isometric contraction does not appear to have a significant effect on the outcome with long and short holds being equally effective.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p><p>Three previous studies have investigated exercise for GTPS. The &#x02018;LEAP&#x02019; trial reported an increase of around 19 points for the VISA-G in the education and exercise group after 12 weeks.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Similar to our study, participants received advice and education on tendon care, both exercise programmes were progressive and pain was permitted during exercise. However, our trial had two exercises per group and the LEAP study had four to six exercises throughout the duration of the 8-week programme so weekly TUT is likely to have been of longer duration. The LEAP study also excluded participants who reported either low back pain or groin pain of &#x0003e;2/10 on the NPRS. We decided not to exclude these participants as concurrent low back and/or groin pain is common in GTPS, with low back pain prevalence being as high as 35%.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> At the beginning of our study 10 participants (33%) reported low back pain &#x0003e;2/10 (NPRS) and 7 participants (23%) experienced groin pain &#x0003e;2/10. It is possible that patients with concurrent low back pain and/or groin pain do not respond as favourably to a targeted gluteal strengthening programme and may require additional treatment which specifically addresses these areas of pain. Further research is required to investigate whether a combined management programme focusing on both GTPS and low back and/or groin pain would lead to better outcomes.</p><p>The &#x02018;GLoBE&#x02019; trial compared gluteal loading with sham exercises in postmenopausal women with GTPS.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Both groups received education on activity modification and avoiding tendon compression. After 12 weeks, VISA-G scores of both groups improved by around 11 points when analysed by intention-to-treat, which is similar to our study, although we analysed by per-protocol. We used a similar education programme and it is possible that the improvements observed in both studies could be attributed to the education component of the management programme.</p><p>Rompe <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> used a 12-week exercise programme, which included daily strengthening and stretching exercises. Results highlighted that only 7% of participants improved after 4 weeks, which increased to 41% after 4 months on a GROC Scale. More recent evidence has highlighted the importance of minimising compression in tendinopathy management.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> It is possible therefore that previous stretching programmes may have actually increased pain through compression of the gluteal tendons and bursa, which would explain the lack of initial improvement. We found that 45% of the participants reported a meaningful change after 4 weeks on the GROC, which increased to 64% in the isometric group and 75% in the isotonic group after 12 weeks. Both the LEAP and GLoBE trials highlighted the importance of reducing compressive loading and this appears to be supported by the results of the present study.</p><p>Isometric and isotonic exercise programmes appear to have similar effects on tendinopathy regardless of muscle contraction type. A systematic review concluded that muscle contraction intensity and not contraction type was more important in tendinopathy loading programmes.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> This is supported by the results of the present study. Prescribing either isometric or isotonic exercise appears to lead to clinical improvements. Isometric exercise programmes similar to the one used in the present study may be useful in certain patient populations, for example, GTPS and concurrent moderate-to-severe hip osteoarthritis as these patients typically exhibit reduced range of motion and are unable to complete isotonic exercises that involve wide-range hip abduction movements.</p><p>Almost all participants, in both groups, who had a reduction in pain of at least two points on the NPRS at week 12 had already achieved this by week 4. It is possible that the education component of the programme was responsible for this as positive initial improvements were also reported in the LEAP trial. Although, muscle hypertrophy and tendon adaptation will not occur within this timeframe in response to resistance exercise, neuromuscular adaptation can occur quickly and may explain this early improvement in symptoms.</p><p>As exercise is the first-line treatment for tendinopathy, it is important to explore and improve the delivery of different types of exercise programmes. Future research could compare a combined isometric/isotonic programme with an isolated isotonic or isometric programme, or an education-only intervention to determine the optimal management approach.</p><p>Despite the benefits of both isometric and isotonic exercise, several participants in both groups did not experience improvement in symptoms by the end of the study. VISA-G scores were worse or unchanged in 4/11 (36%) of the isometric group and 5/12 (42%) of the isotonic group. In the GLoBE study, around 50% of participants reported either increased pain or no change in pain after 52 weeks. Further research is required to explore why a sizeable number of patients with GTPS, and other lower limb tendinopathies,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> do not respond to a targeted loading programme. Recent evidence highlights that some patients with GTPS and severe symptoms report high levels of psychological distress and poorer quality of life scores.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> These findings suggest that there may be subgroups of patients with GTPS who require different management strategies.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Limitations</title><p>The results of this study are limited due to the small sample size and drop-out rate of at least 20% in each group. Despite this, group numbers included in the final analysis are comparable to other studies that have compared isometric and isotonic exercise programmes for tendinopathy.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 41</xref> In the absence of a no treatment &#x02018;control&#x02019; group, we are unable to determine if some participants improved due to the natural history of the condition. Due to available resources, we were not able to confirm the presence of gluteal tendinopathy with MRI or diagnostic ultrasound, so it is possible that participants with other pathology, for example, with partial gluteal tendon tears were included. However, this is reflective of current National Health Service clinical practice and the pain provocation tests used for inclusion have shown clinical utility and are comparable to MRI.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The outcome assessor was not blinded to group allocation which introduces the potential for bias. All exercise sessions were supervised by the chief investigator, which could again introduce potential bias.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the first randomised controlled trial comparing isometric and isotonic exercise for GTPS. Both isometric and isotonic exercise programmes appear to reduce pain and improve function. No difference was found between groups after 12 weeks of progressive exercise. Although these results need to be confirmed in a fully powered trial, it appears that the type of loading does not affect the outcome for patients with GTPS.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SP1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjsem-2019-000558.supp1</object-id><label>Supplementary data</label><p><inline-supplementary-material id="SS1" xlink:href="bmjsem-2019-000558supp001.pdf" mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" content-type="local-data"/></p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SP2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjsem-2019-000558.supp2</object-id><label>Supplementary data</label><p><inline-supplementary-material id="SS2" xlink:href="bmjsem-2019-000558supp002.pdf" mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" content-type="local-data"/></p></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> All authors were involved in the conception and design of this study and interpretation of the data.

wastewater treatment. Colored wastewater is mainly eliminated by physical and
chemical procedures, which are very expensive and have drawbacks. Therefore, the
advantage of using biological processes, such as the biotransformation of dyes,
is that they may lead to complete mineralization or formation of less toxic
products. To prove the possibility of using fungal processes for decolorization
and other applications, the analysis of the toxicity of the processes' products
is required. The decolorization of the mixture of two dyes from different
classes - triphenylmethane brilliant green and azo Evans blue (GB - total
concentration 0.08 g/L, proportion 1:1 w/w) - by <italic>Pleurotus
ostreatus</italic> (BWPH and MB), <italic>Gloeophyllum odoratum</italic>
(DCa), RWP17 (<italic>Polyporus picipes</italic>) and <italic>Fusarium
oxysporum</italic> (G1) was studied. Zootoxicity (<italic>Daphnia
magna</italic>) and phytotoxicity (<italic>Lemna minor</italic>) changes
were estimated at the end of the experiment. The mixture of dyes was
significantly removed by all the strains that were tested with 96 h of
experimental time. However, differences among strains from the same species
(<italic>P. ostreatus</italic>) were noted. Shaking improved the efficacy
and rate of the dye removal. In static samples, the removal of the mixture
reached more than 51.9% and in shaken samples, more than 79.2%. Tests using the
dead biomass of the fungi only adsorbed up to 37% of the dye mixture (strain
BWPH), which suggests that the process with the living biomass involves the
biotransformation of the dyes. The best results were reached for the MB strain,
which removed 90% of the tested mixture under shaking conditions. Regardless of
the efficacy of the dye removal, toxicity decreased from class V to class III in
tests with <italic>D. magna</italic>. Tests with <italic>L. minor</italic>
control samples were classified as class IV, and samples with certain strains
were non-toxic. The highest phytotoxicity decrease was noted in shaken samples
where the elimination of dye mixture was the best.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>decolorization</kwd><kwd>fungal dye removal</kwd><kwd>dye mixture</kwd><kwd>zootoxicity</kwd><kwd>phytotoxicity</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="2"/><ref-count count="45"/><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Synthetic azo, triphenylmethane and anthraquinone dyes are used in textile, food,
cosmetics, papermaking and pharmaceutical industries (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Swamy and Ramsay, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Padamavathy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Their complex aromatic
structure allows for their resistance to light and water oxidation and
biodegradation. It is a feature desired by the industry using the dye, but it is
dangerous for the environment. The non-biodegradable nature of most of the dyes
causes their accumulation in surface water and sediments, especially at places of
wastewater discharge. It reduces aquatic diversity by blocking the passage of
sunlight through the water and creates problems for photosynthetic aquatic plants
and algae, thus, affecting the ecological balance in the aquatic system. Many
synthetic dyes are toxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Namasivayam and Sumithra, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">Divaniyam <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Textile
finishing wastewater and house effluents may contain different classes of organic
dyes, chemicals and auxiliaries (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Lin and Chen,
1997</xref>; <xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">Dos Santos <italic>et al.</italic>,
2007</xref>). They are characterized by a strong color and large amount of
suspended solids (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Golob <italic>et al.</italic>,
2005</xref>). The presence of these dyes in wastewater effluents is highly
visible even in small concentrations. Dyes are the most difficult constituents to
treat by conventional biological wastewater treatment (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Gill <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Robinson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Yesilada <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">Dos Santos <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Khan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Effective dye
removal is required due to stringent government legislation and strict environmental
regulations (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Pandey <italic>et al.</italic>,
2007</xref>).</p><p>Colored wastewater from the textile industry is one of the most serious problems in
the world. In some regions, the textile industry is a significant contributor to the
economic growth of a country. During normal textile dyeing and finishing, the dye
used during operations may be changed from day to day and sometimes even several
times a day. Approximately 10,000 different dyes are commercially available.
Imperfections in textile dyeing processes cause a 10&#x02013;15% loss of the applied dyes
(<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Gill <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>;
<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Robinson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>;

<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">Divaniyam <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>).
Colored wastewater is mainly eliminated by physical and chemical processes, such as
coagulation, flocculation, adsorption, flotation, precipitation, oxidation and
reduction, ozonation and membrane separation. However, they are very expensive and
have drawbacks (<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">Azmi <italic>et al.</italic>,
1998</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Robinson <italic>et al.</italic>,
2001</xref>). The most widely used treatment system, conventional activated
sludge, poorly removes the most widely used dyes and is clearly ineffective at
decolorizing textile effluent, even when mixed and treated together with sewage
(<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Robinson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>;
<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">Al-Kdasi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>).
Environmentally friendly and cost-competitive bioremediation by microorganisms
should be improved. Treatment of textile effluent requires a sound and efficient
system able to achieve adequate color removal. There are many publications
confirming the high potential of bacterial, fungal and algal species in dye removal
(<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">Banat <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>;
<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">Azmi <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Pointing and Vrijmoed, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Fu and Viraraghavan, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Robinson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Sharma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">Deng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Przystas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Khan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). The removal of dyes
is achieved due to biodegradation (mineralization or biotransformation) and/or
adsorption on biomass. These processes use low-cost biological materials, as living
or dead microorganisms, industrial waste from the breeding of mushrooms, chitosan,
peat and plant wastes. The advantage of using biological processes is
biotransformation, which may lead to complete mineralization of the dyes or the
formation of less toxic products (<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">Azmi <italic>et
al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Pointing and

al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">Deng <italic>et
al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Fungi could be an excellent candidate for dye removal. Most of them use an
extracellular enzymatic system that transforms aromatic substances, such as lignin,
PAH or pesticides. Much attention is currently focused on fungal decolorization
processes. The most widely studied are white rot fungi. They produce non-specific
enzymes, such as lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase and laccase, which degrade
many aromatic compounds. Fungi are used as sorbents and/or enzyme producers involved
in biodegradation/biotransformation (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Knapp

decolorization using single strains. The dye concentration for the main
experiment was determined experimentally. The influence of five different
concentrations (0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.1 and 0.12 g/L) of Evans blue and
brilliant green on the decolorization effectiveness was estimated. The dye
mixture was prepared with an equal proportion (1:1 w/w) of both dyes. Tube tests
on liquid YEPG medium were performed in triplicate. The absorbance was measured
after 7 days of incubation.</p><p>Samples in the main experiment were prepared by the addition of two pieces of
mycelium (&#x000d8; 5 mm) cultured for 7 days on MEA (Fluka Analytical Sigma-Aldrich,
India) in Erlenmeyer flasks with 150 mL of YEPG medium (glucose 10 g/L, peptone

KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1 g/L, pH 5.6).</p><p>Water solutions of triphenylmethane dye brilliant green (POCh) and diazo dye
Evans blue (Sigma-Aldrich) were filter sterilized (Millipore cellulose filters &#x000d8;

dyes are presented in <xref rid="t01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, and the
UV-Vis scans are presented in <xref rid="f01" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>.
The final concentration of the dye mixture was 0.08 g/L (0.04 g/L of brilliant
green and 0.04 g/L of Evans blue). Control samples with the dyes were prepared
in sterile medium used for microorganisms cultures and were shaken the same as
the inoculated samples. The influence of process conditions (shaking and static
cultures) on the decolorization effectiveness was evaluated. As suggested
previously by us (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Przystas <italic>et

more effectively under shaking conditions and some under static conditions.
Cultures were incubated at 26 &#x000b0;C. Dead biomass was used to estimate biosorption
and was obtained by autoclaving (15 min., 121 &#x000b0;C, 1.5 atm) 5-day-old cultures
prepared the same as samples with living biomass. All modifications, as well as

brilliant green. Brilliant green is a triphenylmethane dye that has three phenyl
groups bound by a central carbon atom. Evans blue is diazo dye characterized by the
presence of chromophoric azo groups. Both groups of dyes are used for coloring
paper, food, cosmetics, textiles, leather and in medical treatment and analysis

concentration on the decolorization effectiveness. An increase in the dye
concentration caused a decrease in the removal effectiveness (<xref rid="f02" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Singh and

for the decolorization of single and mixed dyes. As they described, the efficiency
of the dye decolorization depended upon their initial concentration. Lower
concentrations of the dyes favored easy decolorization. The decolorization
efficiency of C.I. Reactive Black 5 by <italic>Debaryomyces polymorphus</italic> was
tested by <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>
(2005)</xref>. An increase in the dye concentration from 200 mg/L to 400 mg/L
decreased the final removal from 100% to 80%. A further increase in the
concentration of C.I. Reactive Black 5 (to 1000 mg/L) resulted in a final removal of
approximately 30%. <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Zhuo <italic>et al.</italic>

the concentration from 25 mg/L to 200 mg/L had no significant impact on the final
dye removal. An increase in the methyl orange concentration from 25 mg/L to 100 mg/L
reduced the decolorization efficacy from approximately 100% to less than 60%.</p><fig id="f02" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Influence of the dye mixture concentration on the decolorization

at a concentration of 0.12 g/L (62.3% and 65.5%, respectively) and more than 80% of
the mixture at a concentration 0.08 g/L (81.1% and 96.2%, respectively). A high
effectiveness of decolorization was also reached by strain RWP17 belonging to the
species <italic>Polyporus picipes</italic> (81.9% at a concentration of 0.08 g/L and
71.3% at a concentration of 0.12 g/L). A lower effectiveness was reached in samples
with strain G1 (56.7% at a concentration of 0.12 g/L and 77.7% at a concentration of
0.02 g/L). Based on these results, for further research, a concentration of 0.08 g/L
was chosen; most of the strains removed more than 80% of the dye mixture at this
concentration. Dyes used in the mixture were previously tested as a single dye
(<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Przystas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>)
at higher concentrations. As visible in <xref rid="f01" ref-type="fig">Figure

suggest that their toxicity to the tested organisms increased. As proven by <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Park <italic>et al.</italic> (2007)</xref>, even small
differences in the dye structure, including steric effect and redox potential, may
significantly affect the decolorization rate.</p><p>The results of the main decolorization studies are presented in <xref rid="t02" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and in <xref rid="f03" ref-type="fig">Figures

BWPH and MB, an increase in color was observed. Growth of these strains in media was
always connected with changes in the media color from yellow to red. This phenomenon
had an influence on the value of absorbance in these samples (absorbance increased
in approximately 3&#x02013;8% of samples with dead biomass and in 10&#x02013;22.3% of samples with

was MB, which removed, after 3 h, 15.4% of the dye mixture in shaken samples and
24.4% in static samples. Some fluctuations that were observed for this strain at the
beginning of the experiment in static samples were probably connected with
adsorption and desorption of the dyes. This result is also confirmed by the results
reached using the dead biomass (<xref rid="f05" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). The
decolorization process was faster in shaken than in static samples; after 24 h,
removal was 68.6% and 19.4%, respectively. The final decolorization (after 96 h)
reached 78% in static and 90.1% in shaken conditions. BWPH removed 11.8% of the
mixture in static and 12.5% in shaken samples after 24 h. At the end of the
experiment, the results were a bit worse than in the case of strain MB (67.5% and
83.6%, respectively). The results of a previous study (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Przystas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>) showed that
single dyes were also better removed in shaken conditions. Brilliant green
decolorization was the most effective in samples with strain BWPH and the
decolorization of Evans blue in samples with strain MB. Brilliant green was
eliminated to 95% (shaken samples) and Evans blue to 89% (static conditions) after
120 h. As presented above, both dyes were used in a previous experiment (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Przystas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>) in
higher concentrations (0.06 and 0.15 g/L, respectively) than in the present study
(0.08 g/L &#x02212; 0.04 g/L EB and 0.04 g/L BG).</p><p>Experimental conditions also had an influence on the dye mixture removal by strain
RWP17. The first changes in sample color were observed after 6 h of the experiment
(11.2% removal in static samples and 12.6% in shaken). Slight changes in the color
were noted after 24 h (13.3% and 18.4%, respectively). At the end of the experiment,
this strain removed 71.0% and 87.1%, respectively, in static and shaken
conditions.</p><p>The rate of dye mixture removal by strains DCa and G1 was significantly lower than
that of other tested samples. After up to 24 h, color reduction was approximately
10%. After 48 h, a significant increase in removal (45.3%) was observed, but only
for strain G1 in shaken conditions. The final decolorization effect was 51.9% for
strain G1 and 65.6% for DCa in static samples. In shaken samples, it was 79.2% and
84.6%, respectively. Agitation improved the oxygenation of the samples and the
contact of the dyes with biomass, which explains why the final results of the
decolorization were better. Differences between the results in shaken and static
samples were previously reported by <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Kwang-Soo
(2004)</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Revankar and Lele (2007)</xref>,
<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Wesenberg <italic>et al.</italic> (2003)</xref>,
<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Hadibarata <italic>et al.</italic> (2013)</xref>
and <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Khan <italic>et al.</italic> (2013)</xref>. As
described by all the above authors, shaking improved the effectiveness of the
decolorization. As mentioned by <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Hadibarata
<italic>et al.</italic> (2013)</xref>, agitation has a positive effect only
to an exact level. Agitation that is too strong can limit the decolorization. <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Wesenberg <italic>et al.</italic> (2003)</xref>
described the influence of oxygen and agitation conditions on the activity of
enzymes. The synthesis and secretion of the ligninolytic enzymes of fungi is often
induced by limited nutrient levels (mostly C and/or N) and high oxygen tension. LiP
and MnP are especially produced generally at high oxygen tension, but agitation
represses this in liquid culture. Another enzyme involved in the process of
decolorization, laccase, is produced better in agitated samples. Frequently, more
than one isoform of ligninolytic enzymes is expressed by different strains and in
culture conditions. This is important to remember during the optimization of fungal
decolorization processes (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Wesenberg <italic>et
al.</italic>, 2003</xref>).</p><p>The high effectiveness of dye mixture elimination by fungal strains was also
described by other authors. <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Zhuo <italic>et
al.</italic> (2011)</xref> reached approximately 90% of decolorization of
simulated dye effluents within 8 days with strain <italic>Ganoderma</italic> sp.
En3. <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Verma <italic>et al.</italic> (2010)</xref>
reached the decolorization and detoxification of textile effluents with a mixture of
reactive dyes by using 4 strains of marine-derived fungi. The highest decolorization
was noted after 6 days for strain NIOCC#C3 (<italic>Pestalotiopsis
maculans</italic>). <italic>Bjercandera adusta</italic> was used for the elimination
of color of simulated dye effluents by <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Mohorcic
<italic>et al.</italic> (2006)</xref>. The final decolorization (after 17
days) reached 90%. Additionally, <italic>Geotrichum candidum</italic>,
<italic>Trametes versicolor</italic>, <italic>Phanerochaete
chrysosporium</italic> and <italic>Schizophyllum commune</italic> were using to
decolorize this effluent effectively (60&#x02013;80%). The decolorization of the dye mixture
was also studied by <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Tilli <italic>et al.</italic>
(2011)</xref>. A few mixtures of dyes belonging to azo and anthraquinonic
classes were employed for enzymatic decolorization studies with the extracellular
extracts from the white rot fungus <italic>Funalia trogii</italic>. Fungal extracts
containing laccase were capable of partially decolorizing dye mixtures. The usage of
extracts containing different enzymes resulted in a substantial increase in
decolorization for all mixtures of the dyes, which were recalcitrant to the action
of laccase alone. All this research confirms that the decolorization effectiveness
depends on: the specific structure and composition of the dye, form and composition
of the medium, the strain used in the experiment and the site of strain isolation
(<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">Dos Santos <italic>et al.</italic>,
2007</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Sani and Chand Banerjee,
1999</xref>).</p><p>Dead biomass of the tested strains removed up to 37% of the dye mixture (<xref rid="f05" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). The most effective was strain BWPH.
Another representative of <italic>P. ostreatus</italic> (strain MB) ultimately
adsorbed 26.4%. The lowest adsorption was noted for strain DCa and reached only 7%.
Adsorption was first noticeable after 48 h of experiment, and no desorption of the
dyes was observed. <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Park <italic>et al.</italic>
(2007)</xref> reached approximately 10% of biosorption of reactive orange 16,
reactive blue 19, reactive black 5 and acid violet 43 and 40% of acid red by
<italic>Funalia trogii</italic>.</p><p>To prove the possibility of the application of fungal processes, not only
decolorization but also the toxicity analysis of the decolorized products was
required. It is difficult to explain why, regardless of the results of the dye
removal, in all samples, a decrease in toxicity was noted (<xref rid="t02" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Zootoxicity of the controls with the dyes was
very high, and the samples were classified as extremely toxic. A decrease in
toxicity to <italic>Daphnia magna</italic> was observed in all process conditions
and for all the strains used, even in samples with dead biomass where the mixture
removal was low. After the decolorization, all samples were classified as toxic (III
class). Although the samples were classified the same class, differences in the TUa
value were observed. Mostly, in shaken samples, the TUa values were lower than in
static samples. Controls with the dyes were very toxic (IV class) to
<italic>Lemna</italic> sp. In all samples with strain RWP17, after the
experiment, no toxicity was observed regardless of the process conditions and
effectiveness of the dye removal. In the case of both strains of <italic>P.
ostreatus</italic>, shaken samples, as well as samples with dead biomass, were
also non-toxic. Static samples were classified to class I (BWPH) or class II (MB)
toxicity. The highest phytotoxicity was noted in all samples using strain DCa (class
III). As in the case of the zootoxicity, the TUa values in the phytotoxicity tests
were also lower in shaken conditions. The toxicity of the stimulated textile
effluents was evaluated by <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Zhuo <italic>et
al.</italic> (2011)</xref>, who proved the toxic impact of effluents on the
germination of plant seeds and the growth of shoots and roots. After decolorization
by <italic>Ganoderma</italic> sp.En3, the phytotoxicity was lower, the same as in
the present study. Apart from the high usefulness of fungal strains in
decolorization processes (by biosorption and/or biotransformation), the decrease in
the dye toxicity has been frequently proved (<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">Casieri
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Przystas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Nascimento <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">Anastasi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Przystas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).</p><p>A mixture of dyes belonging to different classes is rarely tested; thus, we
concentrated our study on the evaluation of brilliant green (triphenylmethane dye)
and Evans blue (azo dye) mixture removal. Such a mixture may be more difficult for
the biological treatment than a single dye because interactions between the dyes are
observed.</p><p>A very high effectiveness of dye removal by living biomass of all the strains used
was demonstrated. Up to 90% of the mixture was removed during 96 h of the
experiment. Incubation conditions had an influence on the process. Decolorization
was the most effective and fastest in shaken samples. The best results were reached
for strain MB (representative of <italic>Pleurotus ostreatus</italic> species),
which removed more than 90% of the dyes in the shaken samples, as mentioned above.
Another representative of <italic>P. ostreatus</italic> (BWPH) removed up to 83.4%,
which suggests that the ability for the dye removal is connected to individual
features of the strain, not to species. Decolorization was probably connected to
biotransformation because dead biomass of the tested fungi absorbed only up to 37%
of the dye mixture (strain BWPH). Regardless of the degree of the dye removal, a
significant decrease in toxicity was observed, from class V to class III in tests
with <italic>D. magna</italic>, and from class IV to non-toxic in tests with
<italic>L. minor</italic>. The highest decrease in toxicity was noted in samples
with shaken biomass, where the effect on the dye mixture elimination was the best.
In summary, our research indicates a very high potential of the tested strains,
especially representatives of <italic>Pleurotus ostreatus</italic> and
<italic>Polyporus picipes</italic>, to be used for decolorization and
detoxification of dye mixtures.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This research has been supported by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education

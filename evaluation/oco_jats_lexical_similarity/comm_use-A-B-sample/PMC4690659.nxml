coronary artery disease, bearing in mind that the procedure relieves angina and
improves patients' quality of life. Nevertheless, while waiting to undergo CABG,
patients experience distress, a sense of insecurity and altered quality of
life<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Cardiac surgery affects individuals in various ways. It is an invasive procedure in
which the patient is susceptible to pain, infections and a risk of death. Insofar as
the social sphere is concerned, the patients are separated from their friends and
relatives, obliged to interrupt their professional life and, furthermore, their
independence is restricted<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Patients interpret cardiac surgery as an event associated with disablement and
changes in body image. For many patients, it is a threatening procedure and
inability to adapt to this situation results in increased anxiety<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. These facts highlight a
need to evaluate the patients' perception of the CABG procedure itself and the
understanding of the possible effects of this perception on their recovery.</p><p>There is little detailed information in the literature on the perception of patients
awaiting CABG<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.
Information on how patients experience this situation is important in order to
enable those at risk of adverse psychological events to be identified. Based on the
problems identified, interventions can be implemented that may help vulnerable
individuals minimize their stress levels, potentially resulting in a more favorable
outcome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>This qualitative exploratory study was performed between June and September 2013 by
performing semi-structured interviews with patients admitted to the cardiology ward
of the Professor Edgard Santos Teaching Hospital, Federal University of Bahia for
CABG (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Appendix 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2">Interview 1</xref> and
<xref ref-type="app" rid="app2">2</xref>).</p><p>Due to the qualitative nature of the study, the sample size was defined in accordance
with the criterion of data saturation, i.e. recruitment stopped when the data
supplied by the new participants added little to the material already obtained, with
no further significant contribution being made towards improving the theoretical
reflections based on the data that were being collected<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. The saturation criterion was obtained after nine
interviews, seven of which were conducted with male patients and two with female
patients. Patients who participated in this study were between 45 and 65 years. All
had a diagnosis of coronary artery disease and were awaiting CABG.</p><p>Patients scheduled to undergo cardiac surgeries other than CABG were not included in
the study. Moreover, the inclusion criteria consisted of patients admitted to the
cardiology ward prior to undergo CABG, who agreed to talk to the investigators about
their expectations regarding the surgical procedure. The exclusion criterion was the
presence of hemodynamic instability. None of the patients interviewed were using
psychotropic drugs.</p><p>The interviews were conducted in a private setting and all of them were recorded,
with the mean duration of each interview being 60 minutes. One of the interviewers
listened to each recording within 48 hours of the interview to check that all the
topics had been considered and to evaluate whether any additional information should
be obtained. The quality and understanding of the content were also evaluated. The
recordings were transcribed using the IBM VIAVOICE Pro USB software program.</p><p>Each transcription was checked for the representativeness, homogeneity and relevance
of the data (a preliminary analysis). Next, the material was separated into
categories of analysis; the content pertinent to each category was identified in
each interview; and, finally, the results were treated (the actual analysis).</p><p>All the interviews were analyzed using discourse analysis, based on the thematic
analysis, as proposed by Minayo<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. Discourse analysis<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> provides tools to analyze speech as an action and to
examine how this action may reflect a given situation. The aim of the method of
discourse analysis is not only to understand a message, but also to recognize its
underlying meaning, i.e. its value and its dependence on a certain context.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Data saturation was obtained after nine interviews, seven of which were conducted
with male patients and two with female patients. The patients were between 45 and 65
years of age. All had been diagnosed with coronary artery disease and were awaiting
CABG.</p><p>In the process of becoming ill, there is confrontation between the individual's life
projects and his/her new reality. The patient begins to be treated as a function of
the set of symptoms that he/she presents and not as a function of his/her
singularity as an individual. Being admitted to hospital increases the sensation
that the patient's routine has been disrupted and his or her autonomy lost, in
certain circumstances leading the patient to review his/her life.</p><p>Some of the results found in the present study merit special attention as they
highlight questions particularly related to the patients' experiences and
expectations. The relevant data from each interview were allocated into blocks of
content in accordance with the categories of analysis and illustrated with quotes
taken from the patients' statements.</p><sec><title>Perceptions on life changes</title><p>The individuals interviewed expressed ambivalent feelings in relation to their
indication for cardiac surgery. While recognizing that the intervention
represented a means of improving their quality of life, they feared an
unfavorable outcome. The following excerpts from their statements reflect what
cardiac surgery meant to these patients:</p><p>
<disp-quote><p>"The surgery messes up my routine, but, before, I was unable to do
anything and after the surgery I will be able to".</p><p>"I am nervous and this waiting period is very difficult. I heard that one
patient died while waiting for surgery".</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>The difficulties were so great that a crisis was generated, temporarily
disrupting the personality of some of the patients. While they waited for
cardiac surgery, the patients felt deprived of their place of speech to talk
about themselves:</p><p>
<disp-quote><p>"For me, time appears an eternity. I feel like an ET. People go back and
forth, discuss my exam results and I'm just here looking on".</p><p>"When I went off to have an imaging exam, the doctor talked to a
colleague about my results, but nothing was said to me".</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>It is obvious from the patients' speeches that in the process of becoming ill
there is a confrontation between what the patient had envisaged for his/her life
and the reality that is now presented to him/her in terms of their actual
existence:</p><p>
<disp-quote><p>"What makes me apprehensive is this situation. I can't get this out of my
head".</p><p>"It's as if you were a prisoner in the hospital. I want to get out of
here and get back to living".</p></disp-quote>
</p></sec><sec><title>Anxiety/Fear</title><p>Anxiety is one of the most common psychological diagnoses in the period preceding
surgery. Cardiac surgery is a life-threatening experience for the patient and
brings a significant emotional burden with it.</p><p>The patients interviewed in the present study spoke about their feelings of fear
and discomfort triggered by the fact that they were waiting for cardiac surgery.
The lack of perspective in relation to the future was described by some patients
as the principal cause of these manifestations.</p><p>
<disp-quote><p>"...I keep imagining how things will be. I don't know what to expect,
what will happen, how I will deal with this".</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>Explicitly or latently, fear was present in the statements of the patients faced
with the perspective of having to undergo cardiac surgery. The following
segments exemplify this feeling:</p><p>
<disp-quote><p>"The first thing you think is that something is going to go wrong during
heart surgery".</p><p>"No one has explained what will happen during surgery; I'm
waiting..."</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>In the present study, the patients experienced feelings of apprehension and
helplessness. Some of the patients said that they had no opportunity to meet
with the surgeon prior to surgery and had not therefore been able to obtain
information on how the surgery would be:</p><p>
<disp-quote><p>"I know that I am going to have an operation, but I do not know how it is
going to be; who is going to perform the surgery; how long it takes. I
would like to have this information; it's important for me to meet the
surgeon".</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>In addition, the patients had no information on the postsurgical period and
rehabilitation. It is apparent from these reports that the patients have little
information about the procedure to which they are to be submitted:</p><p>
<disp-quote><p>
<italic>"I would like the doctor to explain to me how my life will be
after the surgery and if the doctor who will be operating on me will
continue to follow me up"</italic>.</p></disp-quote>
</p></sec><sec><title>Denial</title><p>As a defense mechanism, denial allows the individual to remain psychologically
intact by not accepting the problem. The intensity of this sentiment reflects
the dimension of the impact of becoming ill in the patient's life.</p><p>The diagnosis of coronary artery disease has repercussions that are related to
the symbolic representation of the heart, which led the individuals in the
present study to a status of great vulnerability. The following statements show
that the indication for cardiac surgery brings an expectation of rupturing the
integrality of a vital organ, hence the patient's natural denial of his/her
feelings and the need for the procedure.</p><p>
<disp-quote><p>"I'm not afraid. Perhaps I fear that after the surgery things will not be
as expected...".</p><p>"My health is not good. I hope everything goes well. Sometimes I think I
don't need surgery...".</p></disp-quote>
</p></sec><sec><title>Concern with the family</title><p>A situation is evaluated as stressful when the individual identifies it as being
life-threatening. The patients reported that during their hospital stay they
experienced uncertainties and apprehension in response to the need to adapt to
various changes in their routine.</p><p>
<disp-quote><p>"The problem is the expectation in relation to my family. They depend on
me".</p><p>"I still don't have the information I need about how to control my
anxiety. The symptoms get worse when I am stressed. I keep thinking
about how my life and that of my family will be...".</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>The patients' perception of cardiac surgery was a factor that played a highly
important role in defining the magnitude of their subsequent psychological
symptoms. To protect themselves in this situation, the patients tried to think
of other things in an attempt to reduce their feelings of distress caused by
having to wait for cardiac surgery:</p><p>
<disp-quote><p>"When my brain is busy with work, I even manage to forget that I'm sick.
It's important to keep my mind off the problem, even if just for a few
minutes...".</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>The patients sought explanations for the situation they were experiencing. Some
considered surgery a punishment for inappropriate behavior, thus assuming
responsibility for the circumstances in which they now found themselves.</p><p>
<disp-quote><p>"I believe this is punishment. I have to face this realistically".</p><p>"There is a reason and an explanation for everything; nothing happens by
chance. We are not entirely in charge of our destiny".</p></disp-quote>
</p></sec><sec><title>The anesthesia</title><p>Anesthesia was an element that evoked conflicting feelings. Although anesthesia
is given to avoid pain, to some of the patients it represented a complete loss
of control over their own bodies, as shown in the following excerpt from a
transcribed statement:</p><p>
<disp-quote><p>"When under anesthesia, I'll be asleep. I believe something could go
wrong".</p></disp-quote>
</p><p>Since the heart is an organ that is imbued with symbolism, expectations in
relation to anesthesia generate uncertainties, marking patients' subjectivity.
The patients reported that their expectations in relation to anesthesia
triggered distress at the thought that another individual would be responsible
for their life at that moment.</p><p>
<disp-quote><p>"People forget that it is not a heart that is being operated on, but a
person who has a heart. I am afraid of waking up during the
surgery".</p></disp-quote>
</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Taking care of the patient in his/her integrality, with emphasis on the individual
rather than on the disease, is a prerequisite for good quality healthcare. A
diagnosis of coronary artery disease with an indication for surgery involves
considering the patient's psychic component and it is imperative that the healthcare
team is aware of this, particularly during the hospitalization period.</p><p>Surgery acts as a trial that enable the patients to take possession of the clinical
condition they are experiencing. Surgery brought a burden of subjectivity to the
individuals submitted to it and triggered fears that placed their lives on the
edge.</p><p>The findings of the present study show that the patients who were awaiting CABG
experienced a wide spectrum of psychological difficulties. The patients considered
the diagnosis of heart disease and the waiting period prior to CABG as factors that
negatively affected their expectations with respect to their work, routine and
self-image.</p><p>The indication for CABG is particularly disturbing, since the heart is culturally
regarded as the central organ of the body, the source of life and of the
emotions<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.
As the time for surgery draws closer, the patients' emotional reactions intensify,
as shown in their behavior, symptoms and, when given the opportunity, in words.</p><p>For these patients, surgery meant the end of a long period of having to live with
deteriorating health and the beginning of a new life expectancy. Nevertheless, while
the patient was hopeful in relation to the future, the surgery itself had to be
dealt with. Despite the risks, the procedure represented an opportunity for
survival.</p><p>The majority of patients with an indication for CABG report that fear, anxiety and
uncertainty with respect to the future are more distressing than the chest
pain<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. Anxiety prior to cardiac
surgery is a predictor of adverse events following surgery. Many patients fail to
adapt and do not achieve the expected outcome, even when the surgical procedure is
favorable<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Irrespective of the individual distinctions in the reports included in this study,
one characteristic common to all is the experience of a substantial amount of
distress. As a result of this finding, the importance of reflecting on aspects of
the cardiac surgery that go beyond the physical illness itself should be
emphasized.</p><p>The patient's psychosocial status has a great influence on the results of the
treatment of any disease, particularly when the aim of treatment is to improve
quality of life. It is crucial to evaluate the patient's perception with respect to
the stress generated prior to the surgical procedure and to understand the possible
effects of this stress on the patient's physical and mental
recovery<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>. The identification of predictive factors may improve the
results of interventions for those at risk<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Through the interviews conducted in the present study, it is clear that cardiac
surgery involves feelings that the individual's integrity has been violated, and
these feelings generate expectations with regard to the outcome. The interpretation
of surgery should not be limited to a physical intervention, as it also involves
significant changes in the way the patients see themselves and how they see
others.</p><p>A high level of anxiety prior to cardiac surgery is a predictor of recurrence of the
ischemic symptoms, of a greater number of re-admissions to hospital and a high
degree of psychological stress following surgery<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>. The objectives of interventions designed
to prepare patients for surgery include decreasing anxiety and fear by providing
information and psychological support<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The perspective of the patients and physicians in relation to cardiac surgery is
affected by the associated existential conditions. The decision-making process
within the doctor-patient relationship needs to be understood better and implemented
in order to offer an appropriate approach for initiating a discussion on these
issues<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Healthcare should effectively provide the patient with integrated care, and this
demands not only technical support but principally sensitive professionals who value
the subjective aspects of the patients' lives, listen to their complaints and,
together with the patients, identify strategies that will facilitate their
adaptation to a new lifestyle, one that has been modified by the disease.</p><p>Recognizing the presence of defense mechanisms used by the patient in an attempt to
adapt to the indication for CABG is fundamental in enabling interventions to be
implemented to ensure a more favorable outcome. It is crucial that the
multidisciplinary team be aware of the patients' demands in order to prepare them to
get through the hospitalization period as tranquilly as possible.</p><p>The period preceding cardiac surgery demands much more from the healthcare
professionals than just the preparations for the surgery itself, mainly with respect
to the patient's psychological health. This care depends on a qualified individual
listening to the patient and helping the patient feel secure, as well as on
developing strategies to enable the patient to get through the hospitalization
period as positively as possible.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The aim of the present study was to emphasize the significant emotional burden that
waiting for the surgical intervention triggers in these patients awaiting CABG. The
form in which each individual confronts this intervention may facilitate his/her
complete recovery and re-adaptation to normal life or hamper them.</p><p>Surgery acquires interpretations that vary in accordance with the patients'
subjectivity, considering the change from the biomedical model of care to a
biopsychosocial model. The data obtained at the interviews show that identifying how
the patients deal with having to wait for cardiac surgery is of crucial importance
for the multidisciplinary healthcare team, with the objective being developing
interventions aimed at overcoming the deficiencies that currently affect the outcome
of these patients.</p><p>The importance of reflecting on the aspects of cardiac surgery that go beyond the
physical illness needs to be highlighted. An interdisciplinary team including a wide
range of professional areas and knowledge should emphasize and evaluate these issues
with the objective of comforting the patients waiting for CABG.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><table frame="hsides" rules="rows"><thead><tr style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-top-style:solid"><th colspan="4" align="left" rowspan="1">

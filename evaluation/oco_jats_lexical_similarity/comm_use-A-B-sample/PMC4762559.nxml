has not excelled at innovation - doing the same things in a new and better way
or at doing new things. It has been slow to acquire, adopt and adapt
technologies by this time available in other places<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. Although extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
(ECMO) is not a new technology, its use in Latin America is not widespread as
needed. Furthermore, we still have a number centers doing ECMO, not reporting
their cases, lacking a structured training program and not registered with the
extracorporeal life support organization (ELSO). With this scenario, and
accepting that ECMO is the first step in any circulatory support program, it is
difficult to anticipate the incorporation of new and more complex devices as the
technologically advanced world is currently doing. However, the good news is
that with the support of experts from USA, Europe and Canada the results in
Latin America ELSO'S centers are improving by following its guidelines for
training, and using a standard educational process. There is no doubt that we
can learn a great deal from the high velocity organizations - the rabbits - whom
everyone chases but never catches, that manage to stay ahead because of their
endurance, responsiveness, and their velocity in self-correction<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation</kwd><kwd>Heart Defects, Congenital</kwd><kwd>Cardiovascular Surgical Procedures</kwd><kwd>Technology</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><table-wrap id="t1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" style="background-color:#e6e7e8"><thead><tr><th colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1">

</p><sec><title>CONCEPTS AND PRACTICES</title><p>Since its beginning 37 years ago, the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as
an advanced life support therapy has evolved from the complex circuit with a roller
pump and a silicon membrane to the simplified circuit with a centrifugal pump and a
polymethylpentene membrane in use nowadays.</p><p>Although, Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) could be regarded as an "old
dog" in the developed countries, its current form is still considered a new
technology in Latin America. The Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) was
founded in 1978, as an international consortium with the mission of maintaining a
registry of the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in the registered
centers. Nevertheless, looking at the map of the centers registered in ELSO, in
Latin America there were centers only in Chile and Colombia. In fact, the Pontificia
Universidad Cat&#x000f3;lica de Chile, located in Santiago, was the first center to
join ELSO, in 2003. Then, we can say that 37 years after the first successful case
reported in USA, ECMO was not a usual procedure in most of the Latin American
countries. A survey, made 3 years ago and presented during the 25<sup>th</sup> ELSO
meeting in Ann Harbor, Michigan, USA<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>, showed that there is a gap between the starting of using ECMO,
the registration of the center in ELSO, and sending their data to the international
registry. ELSOs' international consortium is nucleating an important number of
health care professionals and scientists dedicated to develop and to evaluate ECMO
as a support of the failing cardiopulmonary system. In addition, the organization
provides educational programs for active centers as well as for the broader medical
and lay communities. Therefore, it is fair to say that those that are not part of
this society are most probably not following its guidelines and principles, and
possibly not doing ECMO in the correct way.</p><p>Historically, in Latin America, ECMO was strongly related to cardiac surgery. In
countries like Brazil, it was often considered an extension of the regular
cardiopulmonary bypass that is transferring the patient to the intensive care unit
connected to the pump with the usual hollow fiber oxygenator. Due this
misconception, the results with ECMO were not good for many of us, and for some, it
is still a way to postpone death.</p><p>After the H1N1 outbreak, others specialties, especially clinical intensivists working
in non-cardiac centers, showed a great interest in learning how to use this therapy
in their daily practice. Moreover, the new demand for V-V ECMO for respiratory
support stimulated the interest in training people not previously familiar with this
technology. Following ELSO's guidelines for training, centers from Chile, Colombia
and Brazil started a standard education process, with the support of experts from
USA, Europe and Canada. Furthermore, the foundation of the Latin America chapter, in
2012, facilitated the partnership with specialists of the developed world - the
rabbits - as well as to bring trainers to our recently joined ELSO centers, to
reproduce the same courses they used to have in their countries.</p><p>The first ECMO Specialist Training Course<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> was held 3 years ago in Brazil at the Heart Institute,
University of Sao Paulo Medical School, with a similar format of those courses
offered in every center in the USA and Canada. It combined lectures with hands on,
as well as high fidelity simulation teaching focused on the ECMO circuit and its
clinical applications.</p><p>Although, our experience initiated in the late 90's, only very few members of the
multidisciplinary team - particularly the direct patient caregivers - demonstrated
familiarity with the materials and resources. This scenario has completely changed
with the continued training of these professionals and the subsequent improvement of
the results showed in a recently published paper of our center<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. Our outcomes improved by using a
1:1 ratio model, where patient and ECMO are both handled by a single bedside nurse
without a dedicated core team. Before training, the probability of weaning and
survival after post-cardiotomy ECMO was 25% with only 5.5% discharge rate. After
training, the therapy was used in 20 patients, and weaning was possible in 17 (85%),
with 9 (45%) hospital discharges (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.01). Similar
improvements, mainly related to training, occurred in 4 centers in Chile, 6 in
Argentina, 2 in Colombia, 2 in Mexico, 3 in Peru and 1 in Costa Rica. These centers
joined ELSO, they are following the organization's guidelines and they are reporting
their data to the organization's database. In our continent, we find 3 times more
papers in the last four years when we compare the number of publications by Latin
American authors with the time we had no registered centers in ELSO. Altogether,
training is improving the quality and safety demonstrating the importance of doing
ECMO in the right way. Clinica las Condes, in Santiago, Chile, received the award of
Center of Excellence<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> for their
high quality standard, and became the first one recognized by ELSO in Latin America.
They have done more than 53 transports in patients on ECMO - among of the largest
volumes in the world. Centers of development, with the necessary funds and manpower
for research to generate and accumulate know-how can advance a diversity of new
procedures requiring their use for a more efficient treatment, cost benefit ratio,
and sustainability of care. These centers, can then disseminate the new knowledge,
minimizing or even eliminating the learning curve as well as producing policies for
the future of the specialty<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Even though, we are seeing a reorganization of the people around us and some are
following these principles, trying to achieve excellence in the multiple centers and
contexts around the world will require time and hard work. As an example, nowadays
there are nine ELSO centers in Brazil that are supposed to report their data and
results. However, the ELSO's data and the numbers of poly-methylpentene (PMP)
membrane sold in the country show a huge decentralization and a great number of
unreported procedures, probably conducted by non-trained personnel. It is estimated
that the number of ECMO runs reported to ELSO represents only 10% of the PMP
membranes sold, clearly reflecting that we have main centers not registered in the
organization, not reporting their data, not following the guidelines, and without an
established training program. In this scenario, is understandable and even
acceptable to assume that many consider this therapy "experimental", without proven
results, not cost-effective and closely related to death.</p><p>ECMO requires a high-level of technical and non-technical skills, associated with an
interdisciplinary teamwork, with the difficulties to accomplish the latter in the
Latin American context. Looking to the future and talking about an advanced
circulatory support program, ECMO is the first step, the kindergarten. Since the
beginning, when we debate about ECMO, or even other complex technologies, the blame
always goes to our economic situation - they are too expensive!</p></sec><sec><title>WHERE ARE WE GOING?</title><p>Unfortunately, in our health system, it is often preferable to reach a large number
of people with sub-optimal care than to reach fewer people with a more
sophisticated, and therefore more expensive care. Cardiac and respiratory support
will evolve with the incorporation the new devices, and will need centers of
excellence with a well-trained people and the best possible basic education working
as a team. Because the adoption of new technology should be followed by good results
and cost-effectiveness, the health priorities in developing countries, and the
status of their health systems are likely to be the limiting factors in
accomplishing a widely available care. International partnership is important to
train people and to achieve better results with new tools. "Nonetheless, foreign
assistance should be adjusted to the local context avoiding dropping a replica of a
proven model into an obsolete system - the name for the practice behind the problem
is isomorphic mimicry. Unless resident agents work to give it a life of its own, it
remains a replica"<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>What concerns us most is that there is still a lot more to come, demanding major
changes in the society, the economy and the health care. The best way to predict the
future is to invent it - this is our real challenge!</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1">

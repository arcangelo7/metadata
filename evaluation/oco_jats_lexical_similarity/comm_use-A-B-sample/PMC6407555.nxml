First, our needs assessment (questionnaire and interviews) in professional football (especially players) revealed that a 5&#x02013;10&#x02009;min concussion module was needed, ideally disseminated during club visits. Second, the objectives were defined (from published literature and by experts) as to disseminate essential information about what concussion is (definition), how to recognise it and the importance of removing a player with (suspected) concussion from the football field. We included an introductory video featuring a high-profile professional footballer and an animated educational component on defining concussion, recognising it and removing affected players from the field.</p></sec><sec><title>Feasibility and effect</title><p>A quasiexperimental study (pretest post-test design) was conducted among 61 professional footballers. These players were asked to complete two questionnaires related to knowledge about and attitude towards concussion and feasibility of the module: one before and one after viewing the concussion module. Potential increase in knowledge and attitude was explored by comparing the pretest and post-test scores of the Rosenbaum Concussion Knowledge and Attitudes
Survey with the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test (p&#x0003c;0.05). The mean knowledge score of the participants was stable between tests (Z=213; p=0.16), while mean attitude score increased significantly (Z=331; p=0.01). Nearly all participants (85%&#x02013;100%) were positive about the relevance, added value, duration and form of the concussion module.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The developed educational concussion module leads to better attitude of professional footballers towards concussion.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>concussion</kwd><kwd>soccer</kwd><kwd>behaviour</kwd><kwd>education</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>What this study adds?</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Following a structured and systematic approach, and relying especially on the needs and view of professional footballers, we developed an educational concussion module.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The educational concussion module consists of an introductory video featuring by a high-profile professional footballer and an animated video focussing on the definition and recognition of concussion, and on the importance of removing a player with (suspected) concussion from the football field.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Professional footballers were unanimously positive about the relevance, added value, form and duration of the educational concussion module.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Concussion is a complex pathophysiological process induced by biomechanical forces after a direct or transmitted blow to the head resulting in neurological impairment.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In recent years, sports concussions have been increasingly under scrutiny, particularly because of their high incidence in collision sports and their potential long-term health consequences.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;4</xref> Therefore, while continued efforts at improving its management are promoted, the prevention of concussions is being prioritised. For instance, in rugby, preactivation and coaching tackle technique have received greater emphasis in high-level youth rugby with the goal of decreasing the risk of injuries, including concussion, while the application of concussion management guidelines is monitored by the international and national organising bodies.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref></p><p>In professional football, concussions are not very common with incidence rates ranging between 0.03 and 0.07 concussions per 1000 player hours in men&#x02019;s European professional football (soccer).<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> During the last five World Cups of the F&#x000e9;d&#x000e9;ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA; 1998&#x02013;2014), only 12 concussions were reported.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> However, the number of concussions in the 2014 World Cup in Brazil (n=5) and especially their on-field management caused a lot of discussion, emphasising how important it is to thoroughly educate managers, players and medical professionals about the appropriate management of concussion. Being the sole representative of professional footballers worldwide, the World Players&#x02019; Union (FIFPro) has initiated the development and implementation of an educational concussion module for professional footballers. This article describes (1) the systematic development of the concussion module and (2) whether the concussion module is feasible (in terms of relevance, added value and suitability) and contributes to enhancing the knowledge and attitude of professional footballers towards the injury.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Development of the concussion module</title><p>In health promotion and sport research, interventions have been developed using structured and systematic processes such as the Intervention Mapping (IM) and the Knowledge Transfer Scheme (KTS).<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;12</xref> The development of the concussion module relied largely on the IM and KTS structured and systematic processes, following four subsequent steps: (1) needs assessment; (2) formulating its objectives; (3) selection of its content; (4) its development.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;12</xref></p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Step 1: needs assessment</title><p>The needs assessment was mainly conducted in order to assess the needs and support for the concussion module in professional football and also to explore its objectives and discuss the strategies for its implementation.</p><p>An electronic questionnaire (available in English, Dutch, French and Spanish) was designed and distributed between December 2016 and May 2017 by the World Players&#x02019; Union (FIFPro) to professional footballers and national professional footballers&#x02019; unions. Questions were related to (1) concussion policy and management, (2) potential improvements of concussion management, (3) needs about an educational concussion module and/or (4) the implementation of the concussion module. Participants were asked to give their informed consent (electronically) and to anonymously complete their questionnaire (FluidSurveys, Ottawa, Canada) within 2 weeks. Once completed (around 10 min was needed), the electronic questionnaires were saved automatically on a secured electronic server. A convenience sample of 306 participants (88% response rate) completed the questionnaire. Two out of three players (65%) who responded were in favour of education about concussion and its management, 90% of them mentioning that their representatives (players&#x02019; unions) were responsible for the dissemination of information during club visits. The large majority of the participants (91%) reported that the concussion module should last between 5 and 10 min.

Information collected through interviews confirmed the outcomes of the questionnaires and also revealed that the use of ambassadors (high profile players) might facilitate the implementation of an educational concussion module in professional football.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Step 2 and step 3: objectives and contents of the concussion module</title><p>A review of the scientific literature was conducted using the electronic database MEDLINE (via PubMed; June 2017) in order to gather scientific evidence on the incidence, aetiology, prevention and management of concussions in sports, with a strong focus on professional football. An interdisciplinary meeting with an expert panel was held in order to explore the objectives and contents of the concussion module. Thirteen participants were selected with regard to their expertise and experience in concussion and/or professional football: four sports physicians, three retired professional footballers with histories of concussion, three representatives from national professional footballers&#x02019; unions, two communication experts and one academic professor. Led by an experienced academic, the discussion between experts was fed by the information gathered previously through the needs assessment and the scientific literature. The expert meeting took 6 hours and was held in November 2017.</p><p>The Fifth International Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport (and related systematic review articles) informed discussion during the expert meeting.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> With regard to its intended duration (5 min), the experts selected the main objective for the educational concussion module, namely to disseminate essential information about the definition of concussion, recognition of concussion and the importance of removing a player with (suspected) concussion from the football field. As the concussion module needed to be used during the club visits of national professional footballers&#x02019; unions and available in English, French and Spanish (FIFPro&#x02019;s official languages), the experts agreed to build the concussion module as follows: (1) an introductory video (between 1 and 1.5 min) featuring one to three ambassadors (native speaker in English, French and/or Spanish) being high profile professional footballers known by footballers worldwide and (2) an animated video focussing on the main information (definition, recognition, removal from the field), using voice-over (easy to translate into languages other than English, French and Spanish) and using recent video footage of clear concussive events in professional football.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Step 4: development of the concussion module</title><p>All information gathered in the previous steps were synthetised and discussed with a creative partner selected for the development of the animated video. Video footage of three concussive events that occurred during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil were kindly provided by FIFA. An introductory video was recorded with two high-profile professional footballers, stating the importance of a valid management of concussion and the importance of the concussion module. An animated video lasting 2.5 min and using video footage of concussive events during World Cups was created.

The outcome measures related to feasibility were embedded in the post-test questionnaire (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplementary appendix 1</xref>), while the following descriptive variables were added to the pretest questionnaire: age, height, body weight, duration of professional football career, field position and level of play. Each questionnaire took about 10 to 15 min to complete. Potential participants were informed about the study (aim and procedures) by FIFPro via email. Participants interested in the study gave their informed consent (electronically) and were given access to the pretest questionnaire, which they were asked to complete within 2 weeks. After completion of the pretest questionnaire, participants were given access to the concussion module and were required to view it within 2 weeks. Finally, participants received the post-test questionnaire, which they were asked to complete within 2 weeks. The responses to both questionnaires were anonymised for reasons of privacy and confidentiality. Once completed, the electronic questionnaires were saved automatically on a secured electronic server that only the principal researcher could access.

Such a needs assessment is an essential step that should be required within the development of any intervention, allowing relevant groups (especially end-users) to contribute to the problem analysis and to be involved in defining the contours of a potential solution.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;12</xref> The needs assessment offers the possibility to collaborate with end-users, which might ultimately increase the chances of wide uptake and implementation of the developed intervention.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Professional footballers and their national unions were involved in the whole process of the development of our educational module, from the problem analysis to the definition of the contours of the module. Therefore, both qualitative (interviews) and quantitative (survey) approaches were applied among more than 300 players. These footballers expressed the need for an educational concussion module to enhance their knowledge about and attitude towards the injury.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Concussion knowledge and attitude in professional football and other sports</title><p>Using the same questionnaire as in our study (RoCKAS), Williams <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> explored concussion knowledge and attitude of 21 professional footballers from one English Football League Championship club (mean age: 23 years).<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The authors found a mean knowledge (CKI) score of 16.4 (SD=2.9) and a mean attitude (CAI) score of 59.6 (SD=8.5), which is lower than in our sample.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Two other studies about concussion knowledge and attitude by means of the RoCKAS were recently conducted among collegiate and kickboxing athletes (18 years of age or older).<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20</xref> In 430 collegiate athletes from a variety of sports, the mean knowledge (CKI) score was 19.7 (SD=2.2) and the mean attitude (CAI) score was 58.6 (SD 8.0), while those scores among 193 competitive kickboxing athletes were 19.5 (SD=2.3) and 62.7 (SD=7.4), respectively.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20</xref> By comparison to these two studies, it seems that the mean knowledge (CKI) and attitude (CAI) scores in the professional footballers enrolled in our study were similar, both before (pretest) and after (post-test). However, with regard to those scores and the maximal score that can be obtained for concussion knowledge (25) and attitude (75), professional footballers need to be educated thoroughly about concussion, for instance through the implementation of our educational concussion module.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Implementation of the educational concussion module</title><p>According to the needs of professional footballers and their national unions, the educational concussion module should be implemented in professional football to empower the knowledge and attitude of players towards the injury. For such an implementation, several strategies might be applied, for instance through club visits conducted by national professional footballers&#x02019; unions during which players are informed and educated about diverse topics. Another strategy might be to make the education of players about concussion mandatory during their precompetition medical assessment prior every season. Such an approach was successful in the English professional rugby where a 100% completion rate is achieved among players, coaches and referees. With regard to their higher risk for concussions, female professional footballers should also be educated towards the injury and therefore, the female version of the educational concussion module can be used.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The educational concussion module led to better attitude of professional footballers towards the injury.

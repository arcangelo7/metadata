biological, psychological and social factors. The acquisition of new skills is
related to the child's age and experienced interactions with other individuals of
their social environment<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. Studies have shown that assess environmental conditions
and stimuli that are offered to children by their families can provide important
data for the development of preventive and promotional health
interventions<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Considering the biological aspects, it can identify the many chronic diseases that
affect the pediatric population, as in the case of congenital heart disease (CHD),
for example. CHD covers a wide variety of anatomical and functional cardiac
malformations. It is currently the most common in newborns alive, reaching 1% of the
Brazilian population<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. The presence of this
disease is also linked to symptoms such as dyspnea, fatigue, dizziness, low weight,
frequent respiratory infections, arrhythmia, and cyanosis that depending on the
degree, can cause physical and motor inhibition constraints that directly affect the
emotional and cognitive development<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. In adittion to this, cultural factors can alter the
development of the brain and should be considered as a dependent variable that
influences and is influenced by environmental factors. Such factor is the
socioeconomic level that includes education, nutritional status, quantity and
stimulation of quality medical care, perinatal risks, occupation, family and social
interaction and housing conditions styles<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Children with CHD may show changes in their psychomotor development by
pathophysiological factors such as low birth weight, cyanosis, among others, but
also for chronic disease that impose numerous hospitalizations, repeated
examinations, physical constraints and consequently, school and social withdrawal.
Considering all this context, children with CHD, depending on the severity of the
disease, can obtain significantly lower scores compared to children without disease
with regard to changing child development<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. This study aims to evaluate child development and
verify a possible association with the commitment by biopsychosocial factors of
children with and without CHD. Children were assessed by the Denver II Screening
Test, published in 1992 and is configured as one of the most widely used instruments
in the evaluation of children aged zero to six years old and is the result of an
update and comprehensive review of the Denver Developmental Screening Test (DDST)
published by Frankenburg et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> in 1967. The participants were children systematically
treated by the Pediatric Service of INCOR/ Natal - Brasil and AMICO - Friends
Association for Children's Heart Institutions that provide support for children with
heart disease across the state of Rio Grande do Norte, in Brazil.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Study design and participants</title><p>This research is an observational case-control study comparing the development of
children with and without heart disease. They were included in Group 1 (G1) -
children 0-6 years, of both genders, CHD, the waiting list for surgery, assisted
by Brazilian National Health Care System (SUS); Group 2 (G2) - children aged 0-6
years old, of both genders, assisted by SUS, who have undergone at least one
surgical procedure for CHD correction up to one year prior to application of the
instruments of this study; and Group 3 (G3) - children 0-6 years, healthy, both
genders, SUS users. The time between the surgery and the administration of the
instruments was set from one month to one year after the completion of the first
surgery because before one month the child is still in the immediate recovery of
the procedure and after one year the evaluation of development of the benefits
of the procedure can suffer interference from other variables. Children from G1
and G2 were recruited and selected in specialized services in cardiology
Natal/RN and the children from G3 were recruited and selected in a Municipal
Center for Child Education in the same city. Children with syndromes, with no
neurological problems resulting from heart disease or children whose mothers or
main caregivers was not present in the administration of the instruments were
not included in the ratings in the three groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Instruments</title><p>As instruments we used an biopsychosocial data questionnaire specifically
developed for this research that includes social, demographic, psychological and
clinical factors and the DENVER II Development Screening Test, which consists of
125 items, divided into four fields of functions: personal-social,
fine-motor-adaptive, language and gross motor. Each of the 125 items is
represented by a bar that contains the ages at which 25%, 50%, 75% and 90% of
the children presented the suggested skills. To test administration, it was
calculated the child's age in years and months and we drew a vertical line at
the corresponding age. The amount of items varied according to the age of the
child, and all administered items were cut by the vertical line and at least
three items completely left of the line. Published in 1992, DENVER II is
currently one of the instruments used in the evaluation of children aged zero to
six years old and is the result of an update and comprehensive review of the
DDST published by Frankenburg et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>In order to analyze the data and sample characterization, descriptive statistics
and central tendency (frequency and percentage, median and percentiles, mean and
standard deviation) were used.</p><p>In order to verify the mean differences between groups, the study sample did not
show a normal distribution, non-parametric tests were performed. Pearson's
Chi-square was employed for independent and categorical samples and the
Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney Test to compare continuous variables. The
paternal participation was assessed by the Shapiro-Wilk Normality Test to
determine if this set of data were a normal distribution and after the
Chi-square analysis for comparison between groups. The one-way Analysis of
Variance ANOVA was performed to compare the average age of parents between
groups.</p><p>The associations between biopsychosocial variables and the Denver II were
analyzed by the Fisher's Exact Test considering the sample size. This
statistical analysis excluded 17 participants who received review "impossible to
test" in the Denver II, considering that this variable could be a confounding
bias.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical aspects</title><p>The study was approved by the Ethics Research Committee of the Onofre Lopes
Hospital/Natal-RN (CAAE No. 01120112.1.0000.5292) in July 2013. Before the
administration of the instruments, the mother or the person responsible for the
child was instructed about the research procedures and invited to sign the
Informed Consent.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The results of the 128 children were collected, 29 (22.66%) belonging to the G1
(preoperative children with heart disease), 43 (33.59%) from G2 (postoperative
children with heart disease) and 56 (43.75%) belonging to the G3 (healthy children).
Of the total, 66 (51.56%) were female, and the ages ranged from two months to six
years (median 24.5 months). The characterization of the three groups is shown in

among the three groups which may be related to the mothers of children with
chronic disease that mostly do not have a job to devote themselves to child
care. The family member when become the caretaker of a child with chronic
illness has their life affected in many ways, as interference in work and
personal life. In most cases, the family member who takes care is the mother
and, in that sense, the employment disruption is not unusual which entails a
change in family economic organization<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The fact that the G1 and G2 babies have more complications at birth is due to
cardiovascular disorders such as dyspnea, cyanosis, irregular heartbeats that
are one of the main symptoms that appear soon after birth signaling
changes<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In G1 and G2, the most common heart disease were: tetralogy of Fallot, patent
ductus arteriosus, ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect and atrial
septal defect associated with pulmonary stenosis. These results are consistent
with findings in the literature that state that these diseases are among the
most common ones<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Unlike other studies that classify the groups of children with heart disease by
disease severity or hemodynamic compromise, this study proposed a separate
action related to the surgical procedure, regardless of diagnosis. In a study to
assess the psychomotor development after repair or palliative procedure with 243
five-year-old children with heart disease, patients were divided into two
groups: those with biventricular repair and single ventricle
repair<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>. In another study, the patients were divided by the
authors into two groups: the ones with hemodynamic consequences and without
hemodynamic effect<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. As the present study aimed to verify psychosocial
factors linked to illness and not biological or physiological factors of heart
disease classification, we divided the children into two categories: children
before and after heart surgeries.</p><p>Regarding the age, most of the patients had their disease discovered in the first
month of life until the child is one year old. However, it is noteworthy that
only in G2 (postoperative children) we found mothers who discovered the disease
during pregnancy (9.3%). This may be related to the fact that the intrauterine
diagnosis is more related to serious heart disease and need immediate surgical
intervention, as in the case of hypoplastic left heart that the rough decreased
left ventricular cavity allows easy viewing even for professional who is not an
expert in the field<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The mothers of children who had undergone surgery indicated that they had
received more information than those who were on the list of preoperative
patients. In a literature review study on the need for information and parents
to support children with CHD, the authors, after analysis of items, consider
that the parents' knowledge is incomplete and that this knowledge is affected by
the severity of heart disease. It is important to note that knowledge is a broad
field that involves knowing from information on diagnosis to the clinical
consequences<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Information from health professionals are usually restricted to the physical
aspects of treatment such as food, observation of signs related to pathology and
notions of hygiene to prevent infection. These guidelines leave
mothers/caregivers restricted to physical symptoms increasing attention and
care, imposing a number of limitations, overprotecting the
child<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>. Lack of adequate or appropriate information can be
related to the large number of mothers that limit the child's activities, and in
this study most mothers of G1 and G2 does not let the child cry, crawl, walk or
run, as well as to changes in behavior after diagnosis (87% in G2). Although the
majority of mothers have shown positive changes, a significant number reported
negative changes.</p></sec><sec><title>Developmental profile</title><p>The Denver II tracks possible developmental delays. Considering that the child
development is a broad and complex process, the developmental delay should be
confirmed, through instruments that can provide a proper study, ensuring the
diagnosis<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>. The choice of this instrument was made from the
realization that there are no available tools for psychologists to assess the
development of children under 5 years of age. As long as the population of CHD
suffers from the interference of the disease from birth, it is advisable for
development studies to assess these children before the first year of
life<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Based on the results, we can say that children with CHD have probable
developmental delay, with a significant difference between children who
underwent surgery for correction of cardiac malformation and those awaiting
surgery, under clinical follow-up. The results obtained are compatible with
other studies, though the division criterion of the groups was different
regarding the researches. In a study on the development of children with CHD
held in New York, 64 children were assessed using the Denver II, divided into:
CHD which required surgical or catheter intervention and CHD without hemodynamic
repercussions. As a result it was observed that 54% of the most serious children
were classified as "abnormal, doubtful or untestable" and in the group of
children without hemodynamic repercussion, 86% were characterized as "normal".
It was concluded that children with complex CHD are more likely to delay risk
than children with CHD who are not hemodynamically impaired<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Similar work aimed to evaluate physical and neurological growth parameters in
infants and children with CHD and the effect of hemodynamic status on these
aspects through the Denver II. By comparing healthy children to those with heart
disease, the authors found that children with cardiac problems hemodynamically
impaired had more "abnormal" ratings than those in the group without hemodynamic
impairment (<italic>P</italic>&#x02264;0.0001) and that the latter group
resembled the results with the control group<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>. A longitudinal study using the Denver
II evaluated 20 infants with CHD at three different times: 24 hours prior to
heart surgery, the intensive care unit discharge and 3-6 months after surgery.
Of the 20 infants evaluated, 15 had altered neurological examination and
developmental delay before surgery, whose normalization was observed only six
months after the procedure in six participants. The authors concluded that after
five months on average, the frequency of surgery was reduced among children with
Denver II "suspect" delay from 75% to 55%<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>This study points to a possible interference resulting from surgical procedures
and convalescence in child development, regardless of the hemodynamic status or
disease severity. Regarding the possible consequences of hospitalization and
invasive procedures (catheterization, anesthesia and surgery) may subject the
patient and family to a series of disturbing situations added to the previously
adverse experiences, can cause great damage<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Biopsychosocial variables and child development</title><p>When comparing biopsychosocial variables to the results of the Denver II, we
could find some aspects that are significantly linked to possible delay in
development and other evidence in this study showed no statistical
association.</p><p>Two factors that were associated with developmental delay were gender
(<italic>P</italic>=0.042) and age (<italic>P</italic>=0.001). It is
observed that most boys focused on the classification of "suspicious" and
"suspect/ abnormal". Regarding gender, studies show that girls tend to do better
in school than boys and that the differences become more apparent after the age
of three, but on average, boys and girls are more alike than
different<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. In a survey that evaluated children in Feira de
Santana (Bahia, Brazil) by the Denver II, an association between male and a
worse performance in the test was found<sup>[<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The difference between the ages can be seen from some concepts related to
childhood development. Biological factors predominate over social ones early in
life. As soon as the interactions are established, primarily through language,
this becomes a major role in the development of a child. Another aspect is that
the relationship and interaction with adults make the child develop cognitive
skills through shared experiences<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. Relying on these theories is possible to think
that as the child grows, they will develop skills and competencies that will
interfere with their performance.</p><p>Family income is configured as an important determining factor in child
development. Evidently, the lower per capita family income is related to higher
frequency of developmental delay. This finding seems to be almost a consensus
among scholars theme<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>-<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>. The socioeconomic status affects the processes
and outcomes of development indirectly through the types of homes and
neighborhoods in which people live and the quality of nutrition, medical care
and schooling available<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Aspects related to age and educational level of the parents, number of children
per family and care before and after delivery were not significantly associated
with the results of the development test. Other variables that did not show a
significant relationship with developmental delays were: breastfeeding, mother's
health problems and use of controlled medication or use of substances such as
alcohol, tobacco and drugs during pregnancy. These factors may not have been
shown to be associated with changes in development for mitigating
characteristics of the environment, aspects of development that contained the
difficulties, and also the population. Thus, it can be considered that in this
population the most important risk factor was the presence of the disease, since
the three groups were homogenous regarding the variables mentioned above.</p><p>However, one factor that showed a tendency to be related to child development was
the baby having experienced complications after birth
(<italic>P</italic>=0.065). It is believed that this issue is more associated
with children with CHD, which disease characteristics may be showing
cardiorespiratory changes within the first hours of life<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>When dealing with variables that only made up the group of children with heart
disease (G1 and G2), different from what was imagined in the early phase of the
study, aspects such as age at diagnosis, type of heart disease, having undergone
hemodynamic procedures or not, information to parents about heart disease,
understanding the disease and treatment, limitation of activities for children
and the child with changes in behavior were not associated with changes in
development. The fact that these variables do not affect the development of
children with CHD may be related to protective factors and resilience.</p><p>Protective factors may be linked to individual features that reduce the effect of
risk, since resilience is related to individual protective factors that predict
positive consequences in individuals exposed to a risk context<sup>[<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup>. In a study of chronic
adult patients where the resilience was measured through a scale, patients show
high levels of resiliency and personal abilities and skills to handle the health
status<sup>[<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup>. Although it is very difficult to measure
resilience in children, it is possible to say that the initial experience of a
child is important, but children can be remarkably resilient<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. The own
evolutionary/sociobiological theory states that humans possess adaptive
mechanisms to survive and this may be related to protective
factors<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>However, the survey shows that healthy children (G3) who were hospitalized for
health care tend to exhibit behaviors suggestive of a developmental delay and
more, the greater the number of hospitalizations that children faced, the they
were characterized as "suspect" and "suspect/abnormal". Hospitalization in
children is a matter studied since the 60's and 70's<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>. The immature thought
process of a child leads them to understand the staff, equipment and procedures
they are submitted during the hospitalization period in a wrong way. The
different reactions, depending on the age, will be influenced by the personal
characteristics of the child's relationship with parents and the approach to
hospital situation<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>. In a study that assessed the impact of
hospitalization in children 1-5 years old, it was found that both in the group
of children with or without someone accompanying them, the most observed
behaviors were crying, loss of appetite, rapid heartbeat, vomiting, insomnia and
hyperthermia<sup>[<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup>. What in fact is represented here is that a process
of illness and hospitalization has strong influences on the daily life of a
child, and may cause damage depending on how these issues have been
experienced.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>It was found that surgery is a traumatic event and brings changes in the routines of
children and their families, with significantly influence on their psychomotor
development. The results showed that despite the development being influenced by
biological conditions of disease and treatment, children with heart disease studied
showed that social and psychological factors were not able to interfere
significantly in the development. This question suggests that children with heart
disease, although it is a vulnerable group from the biological point of view, may
prove resilient to those who experienced disorders. Family support is important, but
the parents need to receive anticipated guidance on know how to deal appropriately
with these situations, in order to deal with their child's growth and development,
as well as to improve their care and to detect problems early.</p><p>As possible limitations identifies the sample size resulting from logistics,
operating characteristics of the sampling sites in addition to the development
assessment process. Characterize with certainty the assessment of the development in
a single moment could compromise the understanding of behavioral expressions.</p><p>Based on the presented issues, identifies the need for further investigations as
early assessment, systematic, longitudinal development of the fields with a view to
evidence appropriate initial support and psychological preparation of the nuclear
family and the child. It is important to have the realization of development
monitoring studies of children with heart disease in other realities, such as
patients with more differentiated, assisted by health plans and other states,
characterizing the expression or absence of intervening variables.</p><p>The development process is broad and complex and investigate these issues in a risk
population such as patients with CHD involves a number of variables that through
further research need to be developed to provide advance in the understanding of
this issue.</p><table-wrap id="t7" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="10%" span="1"/><col width="90%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1">

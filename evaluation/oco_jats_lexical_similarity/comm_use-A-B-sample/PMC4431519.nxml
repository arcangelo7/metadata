Since then, 20 teams (including more than 50 doctors, 40 nurses, 24 paramedics and 12 midwives) have provided assistance. New teams continue to arrive to fill positions as other teams return to their home countries.</p><p>The new deployment and coordination mechanism can also cover teams providing clinical care in emergencies such as tsunamis, earthquakes and flooding, as well as large outbreaks, such as the Ebola virus disease in western Africa, which require a surge in clinical-care capacity. The mechanism is part of WHO&#x02019;s plans for a Global Emergency Workforce.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/hac/techguidance/preparedness/foreign_medical_teams">http://www.who.int/hac/techguidance/preparedness/foreign_medical_teams</ext-link></p><boxed-text id="Bb" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Cover photo</title></caption><p>Students walk to Gyezmo Primary School in Nigeria&#x02019;s Bauchi State.

Thus, health policies can be based upon the best available evidence. </p><p>&#x0201c;We want to promote the sharing of scientific knowledge to advance public health,&#x0201d; said Dr&#x000a0;Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO Assistant Director-General for Health Systems and Innovation.</p><p>&#x0201c;Failure to publicly disclose trial results leads to misinformation and skewed priorities for research and development and for public health interventions,&#x0201d; said Kieny. &#x0201c;This failure also creates indirect costs for public and private entities, including the patients themselves, who may end up paying for suboptimal or harmful treatments.&#x0201d;</p><p>In 2005, WHO called on the scientific community to ensure that all clinical trials are registered on a WHO primary clinical trial registry.</p><p>It also established the International Clinical Trials Registry platform that regularly imports trial records from primary trial registries and data providers, such as Clinicaltrials.gov.</p><p>Despite the 2005 initiative, researchers still do not always publish their results. For example, a study of large clinical trials &#x02013; with more than 500 participants &#x02013; registered on clinicaltrials.gov and completed by 2009, showed that 23% had not reported their results.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/ictrp/results/reporting">http://www.who.int/ictrp/results/reporting</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>Health crisis in Yemen</title><p>WHO has been working with the health ministry and its partners to respond to the urgent health needs of the population since the conflict escalated in March.</p><p>Hundreds of people have died and thousands have been injured. Medical supplies and medicines have become increasingly scarce across the country and health facilities in the affected areas &#x02013; some working at reduced capacity &#x02013; have been overwhelmed with casualties.</p><p>In response, WHO has provided eight interagency health kits for 240&#x000a0;000 people from its warehouses in Sana&#x02019;a, Aden and Hodeidah, as well as trauma kits for 400 operations, 11&#x000a0;000 blood bags, intravenous fluids, analgesics, oxygen supplies and dressing materials to 18 hospitals throughout the country.</p><p>WHO is also in the process of locally procuring an additional 10 trauma kits for 1000 operations. To maintain the cold chain for vaccines in health facilities in spite of power cuts in Aden, WHO was working with the health ministry to procure generator sets locally.</p><p>WHO and the health ministry sent ambulances to parts of the country where they are needed most, while WHO covered the operational costs of the ambulances and installing GPS tracking devices in them to prevent misuse. Additional ambulances are also needed.</p><p>&#x0201c;We have been able to respond to most reported shortages for the time being, but the needs are huge and the sooner we are allowed to send additional supplies into the country without restrictions in access, the more lives we can save,&#x0201d; said Dr&#x000a0;Ahmed Shadoul, the WHO Representative to Yemen.</p><p>As health needs grow, WHO has also pre-positioned additional interagency health kits and trauma kits in its humanitarian hub in Dubai for transporting to Yemen when the security situation permits. </p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.emro.who.int/yem/yemen-news/who-responds-to-urgent-health-needs-in-yemen.html">http://www.emro.who.int/yem/yemen-news/who-responds-to-urgent-health-needs-in-yemen.html</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>Foodborne diseases</title><p>There were an estimated 582 million cases of 22 different foodborne enteric diseases and 351&#x000a0;000 associated deaths in 2010, according to initial findings from WHO&#x02019;s Foodborne Disease Burden Epidemiology Reference Group (FERG).</p><p>These figures are among the first findings from an ongoing estimation of the global burden of foodborne disease caused by a number of viruses, bacteria, parasites, chemicals and toxins. </p><p>These first figures relate to enteric infections &#x02013; those affecting the intestines &#x02013; caused by viruses, bacteria and protozoa that enter the body when people eat contaminated food.

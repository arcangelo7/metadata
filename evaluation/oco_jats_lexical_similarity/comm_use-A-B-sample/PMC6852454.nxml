for valve replacement, however, there are inherent problems with prostheses, and
their quality in the so-called Third World countries is lower in comparison to
new-generation models, which leads to shorter durability. Recently,
transcatheter aortic valve replacement has been explored as a less invasive
option for patients with high-risk surgical profile.</p><p>In this scenario, aortic valve neocuspidization (AVNeo) has emerged as another
option, which can be applied to a wide spectrum of aortic valve diseases.
Despite the promising results, this procedure is not widely spread among cardiac
surgeons yet. Spurred on by the last publications, we went on to write an
overview of the current practice of state-of-the-art AVNeo and its results.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Aortic Valve</kwd><kwd>Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replace</kwd><kwd>Pericardium</kwd><kwd>Heart Valve Prosthesis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><table-wrap id="t1" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="5%" span="1"/><col width="95%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" style="background-color:#e6e7e8" rowspan="1">Abbreviations,

reported in 2011 their first institutional report about a surgical technique with
which they replaced all three aortic valve leaflets using glutaraldehyde-treated
autologous pericardium. Since this procedure is not widely spread among cardiac
surgeons, but it has been gaining some ground, we aimed to assess the current
practice of state-of-the-art aortic valve neocuspidization (AVNeo) and its
results.</p><sec><title>Search Strategy</title><p>The search strategy using MEDLINE, from 1950 to June 2019, and the PubMed

PubMed. From these, 11 papers were identified, which provided the best evidence
to the topic.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Publications by Ozaki&#x02019;s Group</title><p>In 2011, Ozaki et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> published their first case series with 88 patients
from April 2007 to August 2009. They retrospectively reviewed these 88 cases and
evaluated short-term and mid-term results. No operations converted to prosthetic
valve replacement and no anticoagulation was administered postoperatively,
except when the patients had atrial fibrillation. The preoperative mean gradient
through the aortic valve was 81.6&#x000b1;31.1 mmHg and it decreased to
19.0&#x000b1;9.1 mmHg one week after surgery and to 12.9&#x000b1;5.8mmHg one year
later. The degree of aortic regurgitation (AR) was always less than mild
postoperatively. The first author describes that the preparation of the
autologous pericardium was initiated by cleansing fat and other redundant
tissues on the outer surface of the pericardium with the harmonic scalpel. Then,
an excised pericardium (with a size of at least 7 x 8 cm) is treated with 0.6%
glutaraldehyde solution for 10 minutes. The treated pericardium is rinsed for
six minutes, three times, using physiological saline solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). Then, the pericardium is trimmed
with the corresponding measured value using templates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>

</p><p>Ozaki et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>
went on with their work and published a second paper with 404 cases of patients
who underwent AVNeo, with a mean follow-up of 23.7&#x000b1;13.1 months. Survival
rate was 87.7% at 53 months. Freedom from reoperation rate was 96.2%. Only two
patients had to undergo reoperation, both because of infective endocarditis
(IE). There were seven in-hospital mortalities resulting from a noncardiac
cause. Postoperative echocardiography revealed good results with low peak
pressure gradients after surgery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure
3</xref>).</p><p>

</p><p>In a study with a subset of 51 patients with age over 80 years, Ozaki et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>
observed no conversion to AVR. Mean follow-up was 3.5 years. There were three
in-hospital deaths due to noncardiac causes. No reoperation was needed. Survival
at 56 months was 87.0%. No thromboembolic event occurred. Echocardiography 3.5
years after surgery revealed a low average peak pressure gradient and no
moderate or severe AR was observed.</p><p>In 2013, a new publication of the same group came out<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> showing a remarkable
rate of freedom from reoperation of 96.7% at 73 months after surgery. Four
reoperations were performed for IE. The other 412 patients had less than mild
regurgitation. No thromboembolic events were observed.</p><p>In their last publication, in 2018<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>, 850 patients had already been operated on
between April 2007 and December 2015 by Ozaki&#x02019;s team. Preoperative
echocardiography revealed a peak pressure gradient average of 68.9&#x000b1;36.3
mmHg with aortic stenosis that decreased to 19.5&#x000b1;10.3 mmHg one week after
surgery and to 15.2&#x000b1;6.3 mmHg eight years after surgery. There was no
conversion to aortic valve replacement (AVR). There were 16 in-hospital deaths.
Fifteen patients needed reoperation (13 IE, one break of thread, and one tear of
cusp case). See the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure
4</xref>.</p><p>

</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Reports from Other Groups</title><p>Reuthebuch et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> operated on a total of 30 patients by means of the
Ozaki technique between September 2015 and May 2017. The patients&#x02019; mean &#x000b1;
standard deviation (SD) age was 66.83&#x000b1;10.55 years, and 66.67% (n=20) of
them were male. A combined aortic pathology of stenosis and regurgitation
occurred in 11 patients (36.67%). Seven patients (23.33%) had pure aortic
stenosis and 12 patients (40%) had regurgitation only. One patient (3.33%) had
active endocarditis. Between postoperative day 30 and the three-month follow-up,
one more patient died from aspiration pneumonia. No patient required reoperation
or experienced an additional thromboembolic event within the first three months.
One patient developed moderate aortic valve regurgitation postoperatively. This
was found to be due to valvular endocarditis; the patient underwent reoperation
five months after the initial operation and a biological valve was implanted.
After three months, none of the patients had evidence of aortic valve stenosis.
Moderate aortic valve regurgitation was seen in one patient (3.57%). Mild AR was
seen in three patients (10.71%), whereas no or only trace AR was seen in the
majority of patients (n=24; 85.71%). The mean transvalvular pressure gradient
was 6.57&#x000b1;3.53 mmHg (n=22); and peak gradient was 13.51&#x000b1;8.88
mmHg.</p><p>Iida et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>
performed AVNeo for aortic stenosis in 57 patients from December 2010 to June
2017. Their mean age was 77.5&#x000b1;8.8 years. Preoperative echocardiography
revealed an average peak pressure gradient of 89&#x000b1;32.9 mmHg that decreased
to 22&#x000b1;10.7 mmHg one week after the procedure and to 19.2&#x000b1;9.7 mmHg
20 months after the procedure. There were no conversions to AVR. There were two
noncardiac-related deaths. Two patients underwent reoperation owing to IE and
recurrent AR. The mean follow-up period was 30.4&#x000b1;20.8 months. Freedom
from reoperation rates were 98.1% and 95.3% at 12 and 81 months of follow-up,
respectively.</p><p>Nguyen et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>
operated on nine patients with severe aortic valve diseases by means of an upper
ministernotomy. The pericardium was harvested endoscopically, and then a
ministernotomy was performed and the Ozaki procedure was accomplished in a
similar manner to the conventional technique. No in-hospital or 30-day mortality
was observed in their series, and no conversion to full sternotomy was required.
Transthoracic echocardiography on discharge showed five competent valves and
three valves with trivial regurgitation.</p><p>Mourad et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>
carried out a prospective single-centre study including 52 consecutive patients
who underwent AVNeo between September 2015 and March 2017 using autologous
pericardium in 16 patients. Most patients presented with aortic stenosis or
endocarditis. The mean age was 60&#x000b1;14 years. Early outcomes included one
stroke, two patients needing short-term dialysis, and one death. During
follow-up (mean 11.2&#x000b1;4.8 months), trace AR was observed in four patients;
the mean pressure gradient was 6.8&#x000b1;2.9 mmHg. Three patients died later
(of noncardiac reasons) and five patients needed reoperation due to
endocarditis.</p><p>Iida et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>
performed AVNeo for various aortic valve pathologies in 147 patients from
December 2010 to October 2017. Of these patients, the aortic annulus dimensions
were measured in 25 patients who underwent AVNeo for aortic valve disease as
follow-up examination and they were compared with those measured in 15 patients
who had normal aortic valves. No significant differences in the aortic annulus
dimensions were observed between the patients who had undergone AVNeo and those
who had normal aortic valves. The authors concluded that the movement of the
aortic annulus after AVNeo is comparable with that of the aortic annulus of a
normal aortic valve, and thus AVNeo can be regarded as a more physiological
operation in that it maintains the characteristics of the aortic valve similar
to those of a normal aortic valve (which, in turn, does not happen when patients
undergo AVR).</p><p>Krane et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>
operated on 77 patients undergoing AVNeo following the Osaki procedure between
October 2016 and August 2018. Mean age was 54.9&#x000b1;16.5 years, and aortic
stenosis was present in 84.4% and insufficiency in 15.6% of the patients. At
1.76-year follow-up, freedom from reoperation was 97.4%. Two patients (2.6%)
presented with moderate to severe aortic insufficiency after the procedure. Both
received a prosthetic AVR during the same hospital stay. At discharge, mean
pressure gradient was 9.3&#x000b1;4.2 mmHg, which decreased to a mean aortic
gradient of 1.6&#x000b1;3.4 mmHg at six to 12 months. The authors concluded that
AVNeo following the Ozaki procedure revealed excellent early hemodynamic results
in terms of effective orifice area, pressure gradients, and prosthesis-patient
mismatch.</p></sec><sec><title>Every Like Is Not the Same, But One May Give an Idea of the Other</title><p>Among the various repair techniques for aortic valve diseases, the leaflet
extension technique for AR has been used in cases of severe cusp retraction that
cannot be corrected by means of other techniques<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>. The ideal material for leaflet extension
remains controversial and one of them is also the autologous pericardium
advocated by Kwak et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>, who evaluated the 20-year clinical outcomes of the
leaflet extension technique for AR caused by rheumatic valvular disease. We
would like to highlight that this is not the same technique as Ozaki&#x02019;s, since
the leaflets are not resected, but the fact that the autologous pericardium is
also employed might well give us an idea of the durability of this material.</p><p>In that study<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>, there were no cases of operative mortality, but
postoperative complications occurred in five patients. Overall survival at 10
and 20 years was 93.5% and 87.1%, respectively. Freedom from reoperation at 10
and 20 years was 96.7% and 66.6%, respectively. Kwak et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> concluded that
long-term results of the leaflet extension technique showed acceptable
durability.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Bottom Line</title><p>Current literature suggests that AVNeo with Ozaki procedure seems to be a
promising technique and good alternative to AVR with prostheses. Long-term
results with a longer follow-up of 10 to 15 years are to be published yet. The
authors who published their first experiences with this technique achieved
comparable clinical outcomes to conventional therapies with good hemodynamics
and a warfarin-free condition. Nevertheless, clinical trials are still
necessary.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="5%" span="1"/><col width="95%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026;

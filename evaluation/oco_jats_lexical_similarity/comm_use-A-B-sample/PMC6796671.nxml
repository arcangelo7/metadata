The outbreak began in August 2018.</p><p>Continued unrest and community reticence to cooperate with health workers in some parts are hampering epidemic response efforts, preventing the timely detection and isolation of people infected with the virus, and thus favouring continued transmission.</p><p>Issues of concern to health authorities and supporting agencies include the high proportion of Ebola deaths still occurring in the community, the relatively low proportion of people infected who were previously identified as contacts and under surveillance, and transmission linked to possible nosocomial infection.</p><p>At the beginning of September, WHO called for partners to follow through on commitments made and to ensure adequate funding going forward. As of 4 September, funding covered financing needs until the end of the month. Further resources are needed to fund the response through to December 2019.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/csr/don/06-september-2019-ebola-drc/en/">https://www.who.int/csr/don/06-september-2019-ebola-drc/en/</ext-link>

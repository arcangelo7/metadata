patient's medical condition. To assess the microbiological quality and aseptic
conditions in the preparation and administration of handmade and industrialized
enteral diets offered in a hospital in the Valley of Jequitinhonha, MG, Brazil,
we performed a microbiological analysis of 50 samples of diets and 27 samples of
surfaces, utensils, and water used in the preparation of the diets. In addition,
we assessed the good handling practices of enteral diets according to the
requirements specified by the Brazilian legislation. Both kinds of enteral diets
showed contamination by coliforms and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp. No
sample was positive for <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and
<italic>Salmonella</italic> spp. On the other hand,
<italic>Listeria</italic> spp. was detected in only one sample of handmade
diets. Contamination was significantly higher in the handmade preparations (p
&#x0003c; 0.05). Nonconformities were detected with respect to good handling
practices, which may compromise the diet safety. The results indicate that the
sanitary quality of the enteral diets is unsatisfactory, especially handmade
diets. Contamination by <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp. is significant because
it is often involved in infection episodes. With regard to aseptic practices, it
was observed the need of implementing new procedures for handling enteral
diets.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>enteral diet</kwd><kwd>aseptic conditions</kwd><kwd>contamination</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="1"/><ref-count count="20"/><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Enteral Nutrition Therapy (ENT) involves therapeutic actions intended to recover
and/or maintain the patient's nutritional status satisfactorily, and is indicated
for patients who are not able to receive at least two thirds of their daily energy
needs orally (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Waitzberg <italic>et al.</italic>,
2004</xref>). Usually these patients are hospitalized, or are immunosuppressive
and more susceptible to infections either by microorganisms considered pathogenic or
by so-called opportunistic microorganisms. Therefore, enteral feeding requires
special care because it can be a source for microbial growth due to its composition
rich in macro and micronutrients and exposure to room temperature, factors that are
conducive to microbial multiplication and increase the risk of hospital-acquired
infections (<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">Martins <italic>et al.</italic>,
2007</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Pinto <italic>et al.</italic>,
2004</xref>).</p><p>However, it is recognized that the microbiological control of enteral diets is
difficult because the meals need to be consumed immediately, not allowing a previous
analysis. Therefore, it is necessary to implement a control system of critical
points and a strict adoption of good practices in the preparation of enteral diets,
with continuous training of the staff in order to prevent contamination (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Pinto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Simon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). According
to the RDC n&#x000ba; 63 of 2000 of the National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) (<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">Brasil, 2000</xref>), it is a formal and mandatory
condition the constitution of a Multidisciplinary Team in Nutritional Therapy
(MTNT), responsible for ensuring appropriate conditions in all stages of ENT in
order to obtain the best benefits of the procedure and prevent risks of
contamination. This team is also responsible for training the staff involved in the
preparation and administration of enteral feeding.</p><p>
<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Mehall <italic>et al.</italic> (2002)</xref>
highlight that actual contamination of enteral formulas and consequences to the body
are unknown. These authors found in their study a relation between food intolerance
and less weight gain in newborns fed with contaminated enteral tubes. Other authors
also found an association between contaminated enteral diets and a higher incidence
of diarrhea in patients (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Okuma <italic>et
al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). Therefore, delivery of enteral diets must assure
satisfactory health hygienic conditions to allow a satisfactory clinical evolution
of the patients.</p><p>A study that sought to assess the microbiological quality handmade enteral diets,
prepared in households, observed a reduction in the counts of microorganisms that
indicated a pattern of poor hygiene, with the correction of inappropriate handling
practices. However as the contamination of these diets was still considered a
problem by these authors, they suggested the creation of an instrument that would be
able to investigate better the causes of this type of food contamination (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Santos <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Thus, it is clear the importance of assessing and monitoring possible contamination
sources involved in the preparation and handling of enteral formulas, with emphasis
on the surfaces of utensils and equipment, food handlers, and ingredients used in
the preparation (water, supplements, and <italic>in natura</italic> foods). Control
can be achieved by adopting sanitation and hygiene practices for the environment,
foods, and hands of handlers. The latter is of crucial importance, because Enteral
Nutrition (EN) handling at the bedside is a critical point for meals contamination
by pathogenic bacteria (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Okuma <italic>et
al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">Lima <italic>et

al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Maur&#x000ed;cio
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p>This study was conducted with the purpose of evaluating the microbiological quality
of non-industrialized (so-called "homemade" or "handmade" diets prepared in the
healthcare premises) and industrialized diets, and the aseptic conditions of
preparation and use of such feeds, produced in a hospital in the Jequitinhonha
Valley, Minas Gerais, Brazil.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>This study was conducted in a hospital in the Jequitinhonha Valley, Brazil, Minas
Gerais and in the Laboratory of Food Hygiene of the Federal University of
Jequitinhonha and Mucuri Valleys (UFVJM), Brazil, from July 2010 to November
2011.</p><sec><title>Collection of samples of enteral diets</title><p>Twenty-five samples of enteral diets were analyzed, 13 of them being
non-industrialized diets (prepared in the hospital facility) and 12
industrialized diets, collected in two different times, immediately after the
completion of preparation (T0) and after administration to the patient (T1),
totalizing 50 sample units, each of them containing at least 100 mL of the diet.
The "handmade" preparations consisted of: UHT (or long-life) whole milk, protein
supplement (Nutren Active<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Nestl&#x000e9;, Brazil), pureed fruits, and
vegetable soup (potato, chayote, carrot, and ground beef). The industrialized
diets were of the type Isosource 1.5 cal<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and Fibersource 1.2
Kcal<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. Samples from T0 were placed into previously sterilized
plastic containers, and T1 samples were collected directly from the original
containers of enteral diets. Then, the samples were transported in styrofoam
boxes under refrigeration and analyzed not later than 6 h after being
collected.</p></sec><sec><title>Samples collection from surfaces and water</title><p>Twenty-seven samples were taken from surfaces and water: 6 swab samples of the
countertop where foods are prepared, 6 swabs of the measuring cup, 11 swabs of
EN administration devices, and 4 samples of the water used to dilute
preparations and flush out the catheter. Swab samples were taken using tubes
containing 10 mL water of saline solution (NaCl 0.85%). In a recipient
previously sterilized in an autoclave, 250 mL of water were collected.</p></sec><sec><title>Microbiological analysis</title><p>The diets were analyzed for total coliforms (35 &#x000b0;C) and thermo-tolerant coliforms
(45 &#x000b0;C), <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, viable aerobic mesophilic bacteria,
<italic>Salmonella</italic> spp., <italic>Listeria</italic>
spp<italic>.</italic>, <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>,
coagulase-positive <italic>Staphylococcus</italic>, and
<italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp. For countertops and utensils, total and
thermo-tolerant coliforms, <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>S. aureus</italic>,
coagulase-positive <italic>Staphylococcus,</italic> and viable aerobic
mesophilic bacteria were analyzed. Analyses of water and EN administration
devices were conducted to detect <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp. besides the
microorganisms cited for evaluation of countertops and utensils.</p></sec><sec><title>Samples dilution and homogenization</title><p>Twenty-five grams of each sample were weighed and homogenized in a Stomarc
samples homogenizer model MA440/CF (Marconi<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>), in 225 mL of water
saline solution (NaCl 0.85%). From this homogenate, decimal dilutions of up to
10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> were made for the handmade diets and 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> for the
industrialized diets and water, using tubes with 9 mL of water saline solution
(NaCl 0.85%). The analyses of the samples of countertops, utensils, and
administration devices were conducted in tubes containing 10 mL of this same
solution (NaCl 0.85%).</p></sec><sec><title>Counts of total and thermo-tolerant coliforms, and <italic>E.

</title><p>One mL of each dilution was transferred to three test tubes containing Lauryl
Sulfate Tryptose (LST) (HiMedia, USA) with Durhan tubes in its interior. It was
used the Brilliant Green Bile Broth 2% (HiMedia, USA) for confirmation of total
coliforms and <italic>E. coli</italic> broth (EC) (Acumedia, USA) for detection
of thermo-tolerant coliforms. In addition to the Most Probable Number (MPN)
method, was used Petrifilm EC plates (3M Microbiology, St. Paul, MN, USA) for
the detection of coliforms and <italic>E. coli.</italic>
</p><p>For total coliforms and <italic>E. coli</italic> incubation was performed at 35
&#x000b0;C for 24&#x02013;48 h. The analyses of thermo-tolerant coliforms followed incubation at
45 &#x000b0;C for 24 h.</p><p>The results were expressed in Colony-Forming Units per milliliter of diet or
water (cfu/mL), Most Probable Number per milliliter of diet or water (MPN/mL),
cfu/cm<sup>2</sup> of surface and cfu/administration devices.</p></sec><sec><title>Counts of viable aerobic mesophilic bacteria</title><p>One mL of the dilutions described above was transferred to a Petri plate by the
pour plate method, to which standard Plate Count Agar (HiMedia, USA) was added.
After the agar homogenization and solidification, the plates were incubated at
35 &#x000b0;C for 24&#x02013;48 h. The results were expressed in cfu/mL of diet or water,
cfu/cm<sup>2</sup> of surface and cfu/administration equipment.</p></sec><sec><title>Detection of <italic>Listeria</italic> spp. and <italic>L.
monocytogenes</italic>
</title><p>The analysis of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> was initially performed by
adding 225 mL of Listeria Enrichment Broth (M569, Himedia, USA) in 25 g of
sample, followed with incubation at 35 &#x000b0;C for 24 h. Immediatly after, it was
made an inoculation of 0.1 mL of the previous step in tubes containing 10 mL of
Fraser broth (Acumedia, USA), and incubated at 35 &#x000b0;C for 48 h. Furthermore, 0.1
mL of the same sample incubated for 24 h in Listeria Enrichment Broth was
transferred to Oxford agar plates (Himedia, USA) and 0.1 mL to chromogenic agar
plates (BioCen, Brazil), and incubated at 35 &#x000b0;C for 24&#x02013;48 h, and checked for
growth of typical colonies. With the tubes with Broth Fraser it was made the
same plating mentioned, in Oxford agar plates and chromogenic agar plates, to
check for growth of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> bacteria. In addition,
analysis to detect <italic>Listeria</italic> spp. was conducted, using the kit
TECRA <italic>Listeria</italic> VIA, AOAC 995.22, 2002.09 (<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">AOAC, 2005</xref>) (3M Microbiology, St. Paul, USA). The
results were expressed as presence or absence of <italic>Listeria</italic> spp.
and <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> in 25 mL of diet.</p></sec><sec><title>Detection of <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp</title><p>Detection of <italic>Salmonella</italic> was performed using the pre-enrichment
medium of 25 mL of samples diluted in 225 mL of Buffered Peptone Water (Himedia,
USA), incubated at 35 &#x000b0;C for 22&#x02013;24 h. After this period, the primary selective
enrichment was accomplished: 1.0 mL of the pre-enrichment medium was transferred
to tubes containing 9 mL of Selenite Cystine broth (Acumedia, USA), and
incubated at 35 &#x000b0;C for 6&#x02013;18 h. Next, the secondary selective enrichment was
performed: 1 mL of the primary enrichment medium was transferred to tubes
containing 9 mL of M broth (Himedia, USA), and incubated at 35 &#x000b0;C for 6&#x02013;8 h.
After that, the kit TECRA <italic>Salmonella</italic> VIA, AOAC 989.14, 998.09
(<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">AOAC, 2005</xref>) (3M Microbiology, St.
Paul, USA) was used. The results were expressed as presence or absence of
<italic>Salmonella</italic> spp. in 25 mL of diet.</p></sec><sec><title>Enumeration of coagulase-positive <italic>Staphylococcus</italic>
</title><p>The analysis for <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> was carried out by direct count
on plates using dilutions up to 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>. One mL was transferred to 6
Petri plates with Baird-Parker agar (Himedia), 4 related to 10<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>
dilution and two to 10<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> and 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> dilutions, and incubated
at 35 &#x000b0;C for 48 h. After checking for typical colonies growth (black or gray,
with two halos, one being opaque and the other translucent), count and selection
of five typical colonies were performed for the coagulase test. The result was
expressed in cfu/mL of diet.</p><p>In the analyses of countertops, utensils, water, and administration devices, for
the counts of <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> Petrifilm&#x02122; Staph Express plates
(3M Microbiology, St. Paul, MN) were used, and after growth of the colonies
(purple or black with halo), the referred coagulase test was carried out.</p></sec><sec><title>Counts of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp</title><p>To count <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp. the same dilutions, as already
described, were used, up to 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>, and then 0.1 mL was poured onto
Petri plates with <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> agar for Piocianines (M119,
Himedia, USA), and then incubated at 25 &#x000b0;C for 48 h. As colonies grew (white,
round shaped), a confirmation test was performed in inclined tubes with Triple
Sugar Iron - TSI (Himedia, USA) and then incubated at 25 &#x000b0;C for 24 h. The
isolates growing without change in color were confirmed as
<italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp.</p></sec><sec><title>Administration of questionnaire</title><p>The assessment of good practices of diets preparation and handling was according
to the Brazilian technical regulation for enteral nutrition therapy(<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">Brasil, 2000</xref>).</p><p>This regulation contains guidelines for inspection of EN-related activities,
including the following: MTNT activities, general conditions, receiving of diet
prescriptions, storage, water, preparation, cleaning and sanitation, clothing,
handling and packaging, storage and transport, quality assurance, quality

critically the EN quality and safety; necessary (N), which would impact less
critically the EN quality and safety; and recommendable (R), which would not
interfere critically on the EN safety and quality.</p><p>For the interpretation of the results, each question was considered "conform"
(C), when it met the requirements; "nonconform", when the item being
investigated did not comply with the requirements; and "not applicable" (NA),
when the hospital did not provide the service.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The results were analyzed by means of the difference between the values of
medians using Mann Whitney and Wilcoxon Signed Rank nonparametric testing,
correlation and regression analysis using the Minitab software, version 15. The
statistical significance level was 5% of probability.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>Both industrialized and non-industrialized enteral diets showed contamination by

prescription, water, and clothing.</p><p>Among the questions related to MTNT activities, the hospital in question
succeeded in some topics considered essential, such as the existence of a formal
act to constitute the team, formal record of meetings, and records of medical
prescriptions. However, the following were considered nonconformities: lack of
procedural protocols for the professionals involved in the therapy, lack of
training programs, and lack of ENT quality indicators.</p><p>Regarding the activities related to preparation, general conditions, cleaning and
sanitation, handling, storage, packaging and transport, the main nonconformity
found in the category of essential was the relative lack of a separate area for
preparation of EN. The other failures detected were among items considered
necessary and recommended, and among them we can cite: lack of sealed openings
and wire-protected windows, allowing access of insects and rodents into the EN
handling sector, unrestrictive circulation of people in the preparation sector,
and the floor of the preparation area was difficult to clean and had cracks.</p><p>Among the conformities found for all categories (essential, necessary and
recommended), it is worth noting that preparation was made only upon medical
prescription, the staff was trained to perform this activity and such training
was recorded, the diets were kept in an exclusive refrigerator, and the diets
production facility of this healthcare institution performs sanitation and pest
control every semester.</p><p>Concerning the enteral feeding process, the nonconformities found among the items
indicated as essential include: the diets were not stored in the refrigerator
when not used at the specified time; the feeding devices were not exclusively
used for feeding, being also used for administration of medications; sanitation
of tube connections was not performed during the change of these devices.</p><p>Among the items considered essential, the conformities found among the EN
administration activities, we can cite the clinical and laboratorial control of
the patient receiving the enteral diet, and the diet was administered in its
original container. In addition, among the topics considered necessary and
recommended, we can cite pump-assisted administration of the diet; trained
nursing staff to use the pumps; and existence of a manual of procedures for EN
administration.</p><p>Situations not applied to the reality of this healthcare unit are mainly related
to the fact that MTNT has not established Standard Operational Procedures (SOP)
and therefore there are no control records of essential qualities to assure EN
safety.</p><p>
<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Maur&#x000ed;cio <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref>
used the same instrument of assessment of good practices as used in the present
work and found nonconformities similar to those detected in this study, such as
a separate area exclusively for handling enteral diets and structural problems.
These authors also emphasize that noncompliance of an item classified as
essential would be cause of immediate suspension of EN diets production.
Therefore, this healthcare unit needs to implement a strict program of goods
practices for the preparation and handling of enteral diets and an efficient
system of quality control to be developed by the MTNT.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The microbiological quality of the enteral diets analyzed was not satisfactory, and

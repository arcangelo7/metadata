This calcification of soft tissue can result from genetic mutations that cause rare diseases such as fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>] or progressive osseous heteroplasia [<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], although intriguingly it is more common following high energy injuries or trauma. These can include traumatic brain injury [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>], spinal cord injury [<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], total arthroplasty procedures [<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], fractures [<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>] and burns [<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Additionally, one of the most prevalent HO-inducing injuries are extremity wounds obtained through exposure to blast events. In such cases, the incidence of HO can be as high as 63% when the mechanism of injury is a single high energy shock wave [<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Current methods of prophylaxis, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>] and radiotherapy [<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], can reduce the incidence of trauma-induced HO, but are by no means a cure for the disease [<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thus, there is a need to develop model systems capable of breaking down the individual components causative of trauma-induced HO, to study their specific roles in disease onset, so that we can identify new therapeutics to prevent HO.</p><p id="p0030">One difficulty in understanding how trauma can result in HO lies in the complexity of the disease. Animal models for trauma-induced HO have been developed [<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], although there is only one rodent model which specifically looks at air-driven blast-induced HO, and this recreates several aspects of the trauma, from the blast through to the extremity injury and subsequent amputation [<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>]. While this is advantageous to assess a whole body systemic response, and that of several cell types proposed to be involved in HO, it is impractical to use to determine the effect of individual cells to specific aspects of the trauma, such as the shock wave alone. Analysis of serum from patients has also revealed that there is a systemic response following injury [<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], which is likely associated with HO onset as wound effluent from extremity wounds following blast can accelerate osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells in culture [<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, none of these models above enable conclusive assessment of the effect of a single shock wave alone, representative of a blast event. Here, we wanted to develop a simple cell culture model system which would enable us to separate out the effects of the systemic response instigated by injury, from the shock wave which causes injury. We specifically set out to assess the response of cells in culture to a single high-energy shock wave.</p><p id="p0035">Another challenge for the development of preventative treatments for HO is the diverse population of cell types thought to be responsible for ectopic bone lesions [<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>]. However, one benefit of a cell culture model system is that the cell type responsible for HO <italic>in vivo</italic> need not be used. We propose that the ideal cell type to study HO <italic>in vitro</italic> should have the osteogenic capacity to differentiate into bone, but not do so under normal growth conditions, and thus be representative of inappropriate ossification. Cell types such as bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs), have been widely used to study osteogenesis, and even HO [<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], as these cells may be involved in HO <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, because they readily facilitate bone formation [<xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], they may not provide a true representation of ectopic or inappropriate bone formation in an <italic>in vitro</italic> model. Human dermal papilla (DP) cells are specialised mesenchymal cells found at the base of the hair follicle that play a key role in hair growth and cycling [<xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>], and are accordingly unrelated to bone. Curiously, while not being stem cells, human DP cells do have multipotent tendencies <italic>in vitro</italic> and can differentiate down both osteogenic and adipogenic lineages when grown in specific differentiation medias [<xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>]. While differentiation capacity alone does not confer a large advantage over using BM-MSCs, DP cells also share a common developmental progenitor with papillary dermal fibroblasts (PFi) [<xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], also found in the skin. Despite arising from the same predecessor cell in development, PFi do not have the same differentiation capacity as DP [<xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and do not mineralise <italic>in vitro</italic>, providing us with a unique biological sister cell type that can be used as a negative control when developing a cell culture model to investigate HO. While we do not believe DP cells play any role in HO <italic>in vivo</italic>, their inappropriate osteogenic differentiation potential and unique negative control sister cell type make them an ideal cell choice to develop a model of inappropriate bone formation, or HO, <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p id="p0040">A second parameter to be taken into consideration in the study of trauma-induced HO is the type of shock wave that is used. It has long been reported that therapeutic shock waves in the form of extracorporeal shock wave (ESW) therapy can promote bone fracture healing [<xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] while repeated stimulus with thousands of shock waves, each in the mPa range, has been shown to enhance human BM-MSCs mineralisation <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. However, while this form of mechanical perturbation is repetitive and long lasting in total duration, it is dissimilar to the shock wave created by an open field blast which last a few milliseconds in air, with peak pressures in excess of 100&#x0202f;kPa. Thus, in our study we chose to assess the effect of a single high-energy shock wave in air on cell differentiation, with the aim to specifically identify the role of the shock wave component in trauma-induced HO.</p><p id="p0045">In cells such as DP and BM-MSCs, which can differentiate down both osteogenic and adipogenic lineages, there are a variety of factors which can sway the delicate balance, and impact differentiation direction [<xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. For trauma-induced HO, we believe that the shock wave itself has an exacerbating role. We hypothesise that the shock wave transitions certain cells into a post shock state, where they become sensitised towards an osteogenic identity. In tandem, we already know that the injury caused by the blast results in an increase in osteogenic factors in the wound environment, which can also promote ossification [<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In order to test our hypothesis, in this study, we established a cell culture model to study trauma-induced HO, separating out the effect of the shock wave from systemic influence. We used DP cells to evaluate inappropriate differentiation, and a compressed air-driven shock tube to create a single high-energy shockwave, in the kPa range. Surprisingly, the shock wave alone had no effect on cells, however, when cells were grown in osteogenic medium, we see a synergistic effect of the shock wave together with the medium, with accelerated and increased osteogenic differentiation and mineralisation in DP cells, compared to cells in osteogenic medium alone. We found that nuclear and epigenetic changes are occurring 6&#x0202f;h post shock wave exposure and chose this time point to perform reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS), to discover if changes to the methylation profile could help explain the accelerated osteogenesis observed in our cell model. We find that a single shock wave can alter the methylation profile of gene promoters, which leads to opposing transcriptional changes. Further, analysis of the hypomethylated promoters enabled identification of a mechanosensor, Integrin Alpha V (ITGAV), whose transcript increased in expression 24&#x0202f;h after shock wave exposure. Using cilengitide, a cyclic RGD pentapeptide [<xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], to block binding to and activation of ITGAV, we are able to rescind the accelerated osteogenic differentiation induced by shock wave exposure previously observed in our cell culture model. Thus we demonstrate that our cell culture model is suitable for the identification of therapeutics which can mitigate against the effect of the shock wave, and may be able to prevent HO onset after blast trauma.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Study design</title><p id="p0050">Here, we used primarily human DP cells, as well as other cells including human BM-MSC, human PFI and rodent DP cells, to create an <italic>in vitro</italic> cell culture model of blast trauma-induced HO, with the aim of identifying new targets for therapeutic intervention. We performed our experiment in four stages: (i) Firstly, we identified a non-lethal blast using live/dead imaging and Alamarblue assay, and using this 165&#x0202f;kPa shock wave we observed increased osteogenic differentiation in cells exposed to the shock wave in osteogenic media (OM&#x0202f;+&#x0202f;SW). Methods to study osteogenic differentiation included calcium assays, alizarin red staining and RT-qPCR; (ii) we next used immunofluorescence imaging to identify an early time point when changes to nuclear architecture were occurring in the OM&#x0202f;+&#x0202f;SW cells; (iii) using the 6&#x0202f;h time point identified in section (ii), we performed RRBS and generated differential lists where the methylation profile of a gene promoter had been altered by shock wave exposure. We validated our RRBS results by performing RT-qPCR and bisulfite sequencing, on selected genes with hyper- and hypo-methylated gene promoters; (iv) of the differentially methylated gene promoters in OM&#x0202f;+&#x0202f;SW, we identified ITGAV as a gene of interest and investigated its role in ossification. We found that treatment with cilengitide, which is an ITGAV inhibitor, could abrogate mineral deposition in our model.

After washes in PBS, cells were incubated for 1&#x0202f;h at RT with a primary antibody for either vimentin (Abcam, ab24525, 1:300) or &#x003b2;-catenin (BD Bioscience, 610153, 1:100) diluted in 5% goat serum in PBS. The cells were then washed in PBS and incubated for 1&#x0202f;h in the dark at RT with Alexa fluor 594 goat anti-chicken (Thermo Fisher, A11042, 1:200) diluted in PBS for vimentin, or Alexa fluor 488 goat anti-mouse (Thermo Fisher, A11001, 1:500) for &#x003b2;-catenin. After PBS washes, vimentin samples were counterstained with the f-actin marker Alexa fluor 488 phalloidin (Thermo Fisher, A12379, 2.5:100) in PBS for 30&#x0202f;min at RT in the dark. After final PBS washes, the coverslips were mounted on glass microscope slides using mounting media containing the nuclear stain DAPI (Vectorlabs, H-1200). Images were obtained using a fluorescence microscope fitted with a &#x000d7;20 objective lens. For H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, cells were fixed 6&#x0202f;h after shock wave exposure, while cells to be stained for nucleolin were fixed after 24&#x0202f;h. All samples were fixed, blocked and permeabilised as previously described. Both primary and secondary incubation were as previously described, however antibodies were replaced with H3k27me3 (Abcam, ab6002, 1:200), H3k4me3 (Abcam, ab8580, 1:1000) and nucleolin (Abcam, ab136649, 1:200). Secondary antibodies included Alexa fluor 488 goat anti-mouse (Thermo Fisher, A11001, 1:500) and 594 goat anti-rabbit (Thermo Fisher, A11012, 1:500). Intensity of histone mark staining per nuclei was then calculated using ImageJ and normalised to the average intensity of DAPI. The number of nucleolin spots per nucleus was then counted manually using ImageJ (Version 1.49v).</p><p id="p0100">To assess if the nuclear architecture of the human DP cells was perturbed by shock wave exposure, nuclear area was measured over a time course on samples in either GM, AM or OM.

Human DP cells were harvested 6&#x0202f;h post shock wave exposure. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated using a commercially available kit (Zymo, Quick DNA Kit, D4068) following the manufacturer's recommended instructions. As a final step to increase the concentration of gDNA, concentrator columns (Zymo, Spin IC-XL, C1002-25) were used. 100&#x0202f;ng of gDNA per sample was sent to Diagenode for RRBS methylation profiling. To identify differentially methylated CpGs, comparative analysis on the RRBS datasets was performed with methylKit [<xref rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] using hg19, refGene and CpG island annotation from UCSC [<xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] (methylation difference cut-off of 25% and q-value of &#x02264;0.01).

We then assessed the influence of methylation on transcriptional activity by performing RT-qPCR as previously described, using mRNA isolated from DP cells at 6 and 24&#x0202f;h post shock wave exposure. Primers for RT-qPCR were designed for genes containing one or more differentially methylated CpGs within its promoter region and included ITGAV, MAP2K2, KCP, DEF6, DLK1 and CEBPB (Table S1). For our generated gene lists, hypomethylated promoters were given a pseudo +1 expression value while hypermethylated genes were labelled &#x02212;1, then core analysis was performed using IPA (QIAGEN Inc., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuity-pathway-analysis" id="ir0005">https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuity-pathway-analysis</ext-link>).

When we assessed cell viability we found that cells remained viable when exposed to shock waves with a peak pressure up to 165&#x0202f;kPa (Fig. S1). At pressures higher than this, cells would rip off the plate in sheets. We therefore chose to expose cells to a maximum shock wave of 165&#x0202f;kPa in subsequent experiments. Before assessing osteogenic differentiation by quantifying mineralisation, we looked to see whether early changes were induced by exposure of human DP cells to a shock wave, such as variances in expression of osteogenic master regulators (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a). We found that Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) expression was significantly increased (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>b) by 2 fold in osteogenic media&#x0202f;+&#x0202f;shock wave (OM&#x0202f;+&#x0202f;SW, Mean&#x0202f;&#x000b1;&#x0202f;SD 2.127&#x0202f;&#x000b1;&#x0202f;0.307) when compared to osteogenic media (OM, 1.025&#x0202f;&#x000b1;&#x0202f;0.238) alone. The RUNX2 activator, distal-less homeobox 5 (DLX5) was also found to have increased 8 fold (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>c) in OM&#x0202f;+&#x0202f;SW (8.398&#x0202f;&#x000b1;&#x0202f;0.993) when compared to the OM control (1.013&#x0202f;&#x000b1;&#x0202f;0.180). No changes were observed in cells in growth media (GM) in response to a shock wave alone (data not shown). However, considering that these osteogenic master regulators were significantly up regulated just 24&#x0202f;h after exposure of cells to a shock wave in OM, we decided to determine whether the shock wave also promoted an increase in osteogenic differentiation, and notably end point mineralisation, in either OM or GM. A live cell imaging microscope (Incucyte) in combination with a calcium assay were used to observe the onset and determine the amount of mineralisation occurring in all conditions over several days. We found that calcium was deposited more rapidly (<xref rid="ec0010" ref-type="supplementary-material">Movie S1</xref>) and at significantly higher amounts in cells cultured in OM&#x0202f;+&#x0202f;SW (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>d, Mean&#x0202f;&#x000b1;&#x0202f;SD, OM&#x0202f;+&#x0202f;SW&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;0.112&#x0202f;&#x000b1;&#x0202f;0.081) when compared to all other conditions (Mean&#x0202f;&#x000b1;&#x0202f;SD, GM&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;0.007&#x0202f;&#x000b1;&#x0202f;0.012, GM&#x0202f;+&#x0202f;SW&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;0.003&#x0202f;&#x000b1;&#x0202f;0.004, OM&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;0.026&#x0202f;&#x000b1;&#x0202f;0.044). It is important to note that the shock wave did not accelerate proliferation of cells compared to controls, (Fig. S1e) and so the described effects were not due to more cells being present. Next we used rodent DP cells and assessed both calcium ion content (Fig. S2a) and total mineralisation with alizarin red staining (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>e). We found the same osteogenic effect was observed in rodent DP as in human DP, with strikingly more staining for mineral present in cells exposed to OM&#x0202f;+&#x0202f;SW compared to all other conditions. Overall these results suggest there is a synergistic effect of the OM together with exposure to a shock wave that results in acceleration of osteogenic differentiation and mineralisation in both human and rodent DP cells. We also assessed the effect of OM&#x0202f;+&#x0202f;SW on human BM-MSCs and found more mineral was present in the OM&#x0202f;+&#x0202f;SW condition compared to OM (Fig. S2b). To determine if this was a shock wave specific response we assessed the effect of the shock wave on another human cell type, dermal PFi, the aforementioned sister cell type of DP cells. We found that neither OM nor OM&#x0202f;+&#x0202f;SW had any effect on mineralisation in dermal PFi (Fig. S2c) implying that the effect of the shock wave is not transferable to all mesenchymal cell types. Considering the high prevalence of inappropriate ossification in blast causalities suffering with HO, the increased osteogenic capacity of the shock wave exposed DP cells in our model, combined with the lack of ossification in a biologically matched control cell type, we conclude that human DP are an ideal model cell type to determine the epigenetic basis of inappropriate ossification, otherwise known as trauma-induced HO.</p></sec><sec id="s0085"><label>3.2</label><title>Shock wave-induced OM accelerates changes to nuclear architecture</title><p id="p0140">After identifying that shock waves together with OM can accelerate osteogenic differentiation compared to OM alone, we postulated that there would be nuclear changes induced early on by the shock wave.

As approximately 70% of gene promotors contain CpG islands [<xref rid="bb0290" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], whose activity is governed by their methylation status [<xref rid="bb0295" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], we performed reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) on gDNA isolated from human DP cells at the 6&#x0202f;h time point, with the aim of identifying CpGs located within gene promoters which are differentially methylated as a result of shock wave exposure or change into osteogenic media (Figs. S4 and S5, Table S2). To identify differentially methylated regions, comparative analysis was performed on GM <italic>vs</italic>. GM&#x0202f;+&#x0202f;SW, GM <italic>vs</italic>. OM, GM <italic>vs</italic>. OM&#x0202f;+&#x0202f;SW and OM <italic>vs</italic>. OM&#x0202f;+&#x0202f;SW. Performing hierarchical clustering revealed similarity between biological replicates, yet differences between conditions (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>a). From the comparative analyses we generated gene lists for both hypo and hyper-methylated genes, using the inclusion criteria that at least 1 differentially methylated CpG was located within the promoter region of that gene (Table S3). As our main interest was trying to identify what may be causing the acceleration in osteogenic differentiation seen in OM&#x0202f;+&#x0202f;SW cells, we used Venn diagrams to narrow our focus on differentially methylated gene promoters that were exclusive to the OM&#x0202f;+&#x0202f;SW condition when compared to either GM or OM (Fig. 3b,c). We further narrowed our focus by investigating genes which showed &#x0003e;1 differentially methylated CpG in their promotor. Hypo-methylated genes included the mechanosensor ITGAV and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling enhancer Kielin/Chordin-Like Protein (KCP) [<xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. ITGAV, which is found in focal adhesions, is known to increase in expression in BM-MSCs undergoing osteogenic differentiation [<xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], while gene knockdown in adipose stem cells can promote adipogenic differentiation [<xref rid="bb0275" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. KCP has also been found to increase BMP signalling in a paracrine manner, where KCP binds to BMP7 and enhances binding to the type I receptor [<xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Hyper-methylated genes included the adipose progenitor cell marker Delta Like Non-Canonical Notch Ligand 1 (DLK1) [<xref rid="bb0325" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] and DEF6 Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor (DEF6), thus it seems there may be a dichotomy between osteogenic enhancement and adipogenic inhibition in terms of hypo- and hyper-methylated promotors. To validate our RRBS findings we then performed bisulfite sequencing on new gDNA samples isolated from both human DP cells and BM-MSC, in OM and OM&#x0202f;+&#x0202f;SW conditions at the same 6&#x0202f;h time point (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref>d, S6). We found that hyper-methylation and hypo-methylation of regions of interest within gene promoters identified in RRBS analysis was again present with trends following the correct direction in both DP cells and BM-MSC, however, the impact of the shock wave on altering methylation was not always as striking as that identified in the RRBS. As the bisulfite sequencing validation was performed on newly generated gDNA samples from primary human cells, minor differences between how the cells reacted to the shock wave will have been present and perhaps the cells may have required additional time post shock wave exposure for larger changes to methylation to occur fully. To investigate the RRBS methylation data further, using the bioinformatics tool, SeqMonk, we were able to create promoter regions 2&#x0202f;kb upstream of the transcription start site and ascertain an overall methylation score of that region of interest. Genes where multiple differentially methylated CpGs were identified within the promoter showed clear changes in methylation score in OM <italic>vs</italic>.

Using the IPA knowledge base we were able to perform an additional analysis in the form of a prediction network centred on ITGAV, to investigate its potential influence on other HO associated hypo- and hyper-methylated promoters (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>b). A number of the top functions affected by the generated network had osteogenic associated applications, including the growth of bone tissue and proliferation of osteoblasts. Interestingly, adipogenesis was predicted to be inhibited, implying that ITGAV activity may be involved in modulating adipogenic or osteogenic fate decisions. Increased expression of ITGAV is associated with osteogenic differentiation, while inhibition through gene knockdown promotes adipogenesis. Cilengitide is small molecule cyclopeptide, which inhibits binding and activation of both ITGAV/B3 and ITGAV/B5 [<xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], and use of this in cultures of adipose stem cells has previously been shown to elicit a similar effect to ITGAV gene knockdown, namely increased adipogenesis [<xref rid="bb0275" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. We therefore postulated that cilengitide might also serve to inhibit shock wave-induced osteogenesis. On testing this, we found that not only did cilengitide abrogate the accelerated differentiation effect of the shock wave, but it was able to completely prevent the onset of mineral deposition in human DP cells in OM (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4</xref>c, S7b). To determine if our cell culture model could accurately predict cell response in other mesenchymal cell types, we also wanted to test cilengitide on other cell types which can differentiate into bone. We found that on human BM-MSCs, treatment with cilengitide was again able to significantly abrogate osteogenesis (Fig. S7c,d), showing us the adaptability of our culture model system and supporting our position that DP cells are an appropriate cell type to effectively model HO. Clear morphological differences were present in BM-MSCs cultured in the presence of 10&#x0202f;&#x003bc;M cilengitide (Fig. S7d). To determine if cilengitide was reducing the mineralisation capacity of cells by having an inhibitory effect on pathways, or by decreasing cell viability, we performed a concentration viability/proliferation test to identify a dose that did not have a negative impact on cells. We found that a dose of 1&#x0202f;nM of cilengitide did not affect viability or proliferation (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>d) and when we tested this concentration on mineralisation, found that it was still effective in abrogating the onset of mineral in BM-MSCs after 21&#x0202f;days in culture. This data highlights that our cell culture model of trauma-induced HO can be used to identify therapeutics to inhibit inappropriate ossification that arise specifically from the mechanical perturbation of the shock wave <italic>in vitro</italic>, with the next step being to evaluate if our findings can be translated to prevent HO in an animal model <italic>in vivo</italic>, where a systemic response will also be present.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0100"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0185">With the aim of further understanding trauma-induced HO, we describe in this manuscript the development of a simple cell culture model system which enables assessment of cellular response to one component of the blast, specifically a 165&#x0202f;kPa shock wave in air. Using human mesenchymal DP cells to model inappropriate ossification <italic>in vitro</italic>, we show that a single shock wave can increase expression of osteogenic master regulators RUNX2 and DLX5, which ultimately lead to accelerated mineral deposition by cells (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). To our knowledge, no other <italic>in vitro</italic> trauma-induced HO osteogenic models that use a compressed air-driven shock tube have been reported, however, animal HO models show similarities in the form of ectopic bone formation following blast-induced injury [<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>]. Using a cell culture model enables us to separate out the traumatic events caused by exposure to a blast wave, from the direct effect of the shock wave itself.</p><p id="p0190">As we wanted to model trauma-induced HO, we chose to evaluate cellular response to a single high energy blast in air. Mechanical loading and osteogenesis is not new and others have reported enhanced osteogenic capacity <italic>in vitro</italic> using thousands of low energy ESWs over a period of time. In human BM-MSCs, ESW can promote enhanced osteogenesis by Ras activation [<xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and cellular Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) activation of P2X7 receptors [<xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Interestingly, application of ESW has been found to promote the opposite effect on adipogenic activity by inhibiting the process in human BM-MSCs [<xref rid="bb0335" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Given their osteogenic differentiation capacity, ESW are used therapeutically in clinics to treat musculoskeletal conditions, where their low intensity pulses mean they do not inadvertently cause HO. While the ESW models discussed are significantly different to the trauma associated model reported in this study, they support the hypothesis that application of mechanical loading can transform cell identity into an enhanced osteogenic state.</p><p id="p0195">As our model was able to transition cells <italic>in vitro</italic> into an enhanced osteogenic state, we wanted to explore the possible epigenetic machinery behind this. We identified 6&#x0202f;h as a post-blast time point of interest, as there was an increase in cell nuclear area at this time in the OM&#x0202f;+&#x0202f;SW condition, 18&#x0202f;h ahead of the observed increase in the OM control (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>a). This suggests that changes to nuclear architecture are occurring at an accelerated rate in cells in OM&#x0202f;+&#x0202f;SW. Of the many epigenetic mechanisms, we decided to focus our attention on DNA methylation. The methylation profile within the promoter region has been reported to play a regulatory role that affects the transcription of osteogenic genes, such as osteocalcin (OCN), DLX5, osterix and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) [<xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="bb0340" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="bb0315" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="bb0345" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. In our model using RRBS, we were able to identify hundreds of genes that contained at least a single differentially methylated CpG within their promoter region (Fig. 3b,c) following mechanical stimulation in the form of a shock wave. When multiple CpGs in a single promoter were detected as differentially methylated, we were able to see clear changes in the methylation score of the entire promoter region, but change within a single CpG was not sufficient to change the overall score of the promoter region (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>e). Intriguingly, in promoters that contained only a single differentially methylated CpG, we still identified changes in gene transcription (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>f), implying that a single differentially methylated CpG may potentially influence transcriptional changes, although other factors that influence transcription may also play a role. In a previous study that looked at the regulatory landscape of osteogenic differentiation in immortalised human BM-MSCs over 28&#x0202f;days in osteogenic culture, altered methylation status was found at 1273 CpG sites: 1121 sites with decreased methylation and 152 sites with increased methylation [<xref rid="bb0350" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. These changes in methylation status affected 710 genes, which when averaged, identified a total of 1.6 CpG sites per gene. This study concluded that DNA methylation remained relatively constant and was not important for governing the osteogenic differentiation of BM-MSCs. However, because we are able to see transcriptional changes that may result from a single differentially methylated CpG, our data suggest that DNA methylation may play a far more important role in the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal cells than previously thought.</p><p id="p0200">Application of mechanical strain on rat BM-MSCs has been reported to impede adipogenic differentiation and enhance osteogenic differentiation [<xref rid="bb0355" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Mechanical cues that affect DNA methylation have also been reported, such as the application of dynamic fluid flow on murine BM-MSCs causing a decrease in the methylation of the osteopontin (OPN) promoter, which ultimately led to increased OPN transcription [<xref rid="bb0360" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>].</p><p id="p0205">IPA analyses on our methylation data identified OM <italic>vs</italic>. OM&#x0202f;+&#x0202f;SW as containing a number of skeletal and osteogenic development associated genes which were hypo-methylated, alongside several hyper-methylated genes which were associated with adipogenesis. When we identified that there was a drug, cilengitide, which inhibited one of our hypo-methylated genes, the transmembrane receptor integrin ITGAV, and could also accelerate adipogenesis, we postulated that it acted by shifting the delicate balance between osteo- and adipo-genic differentiation towards an adipogenic fate [<xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. When we tested this drug as a means to abrogate shock wave-induced osteogenesis, we found that on DP cells in OM, or OM&#x0202f;+&#x0202f;SW, we completely averted mineral deposition (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4</xref>c and S7b). Further testing of cilengitide on human BM-MSCs showed similar results to in DP cells (Fig. S7c,d), highlighting the adaptability of our cell culture model. Thus, as a preventative treatment for HO, cilengitide may serve to inhibit sensitisation of cells to an osteogenic identity, and in turn prevent ectopic bone formation.</p><p id="p0210">In this study we focused on analysing the cellular response to a shock wave, as a single component of blast, and identified the integrin ITGAV as a molecule of interest for its potential role in the production of ectopic mineral deposition. Interestingly, the recent identification of potential factors that may play a role in HO, which are elevated in the serum of patients exposed to blast, show some similarities with our shock wave <italic>in vitro</italic> model. Proteomic biomarker analysis on human serum from healthy and HO subjects combined revealed enrichment of B1 and B3 integrin cell surface interactions. Further network analysis on all serum proteins that were differentially expressed between subjects with and without HO, displayed pathway enrichment for extracellular matrix&#x02013;receptor interactions [<xref rid="bb0365" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], inclusive of integrins. In a separate study, serum from civilian and military subjects with trauma-induced HO was found to alter the gene profile of human adipose derived stem cells (ASCs), by impacting the MAPK signalling pathway [<xref rid="bb0370" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Similarities in the altered regulatory pathways between serum HO and blast-<italic>in vitro</italic> HO models suggest they may play a similar role in the initiation of an osteogenic cell phenotype, however, one outstanding question in the serum HO model is with regard to which cells secrete factors leading to the systemic response seen in response to blast. Understanding this would help us to elucidate if HO is caused by a cell autonomous, or non-cell autonomous effect. Despite this, blast-induced HO is still a complex disease that is influenced by multiple factors such as the initial injury obtained by blast, and the systemic response to trauma. Considering the similarities in HO serum models [<xref rid="bb0365" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,<xref rid="bb0370" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] and the present blast-model, the next step would be to test the efficacy of the ITGAV inhibitor cilengitide in a blast-HO animal model, where all the factors from blast-induced trauma will be present.</p></sec><sec id="s0105"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0215">In summary, we have shown here that a single high energy shock wave can accelerate osteogenic differentiation in DP and BM-MSCs, but not in a DP sister cell type known as PFi. We also revealed that a shock wave can induce changes in the methylation status of gene promoters, leading to altered transcription profiles. Finally, focusing our attention on ITGAV, whose promoter is hypo-methylated in DP cells as a result of shock wave exposure, we were able to identify cilengitide, an ITGAV inhibitor, which was capable of abrogating ossification in both human DP cells and BM-MSCs. We believe that DP cells are an excellent <italic>in vitro</italic> model to study inappropriate ossification, or blast trauma-induced HO, and as shown here, our model system can be used to identify therapeutics to prevent disease onset. Our data indicate that cilengitide is an effective inhibitor of HO <italic>in vitro</italic>, however, ultimately we seek to translate these findings and demonstrate prevention of HO <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="p0220">The following are the supplementary data related to this article.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ec0005"><caption><p>Supplementary material</p></caption><media xlink:href="mmc1.docx"><alt-text>Image 1</alt-text></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ec0010"><caption><title>Movie S1</title><p>Live cell imaging of shock wave response in DP cells in GM and OM.</p></caption><media xlink:href="mmc2.mp4"><alt-text>Movie S1</alt-text></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bi0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bb0005"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hatsell</surname><given-names>S.J.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>ACVR1R206H receptor mutation causes fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva by imparting responsiveness to activin A</article-title><source>Sci.

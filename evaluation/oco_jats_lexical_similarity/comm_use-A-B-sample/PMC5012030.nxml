However, in the current literature, little is known regarding the normal pattern of postural control in young children. This study was therefore conducted as an effort to fill this knowledge gap. Eight normal school-aged children participated. Posture assessment was conducted before (7&#x02013;8 a.m. in the morning) and after (4&#x02013;7 p.m. in the afternoon) school on regular school days using the Balance Master&#x000ae; evaluation system composed of 3 static tests and 2 dynamic balance tests. A significant difference in the weight-bearing squats was detected between morning hours and afternoon hours (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). By end of afternoon, the body weight was borne mainly on the left side with the knee fully extended and at various degrees of knee flexion. A significantly better directional control of the lateral rhythmic weight shifts was observed at the end of the afternoon than at morning hours (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). In summary, most of our findings are inconsistent with results from previous studies in adults, suggesting age-related differences in posture control in humans. On a regular school day, the capacity of postural control and laterality or medio-lateral balance in children varies between morning and afternoon hours. We suggest that posturographic assessment in children, either in normal (e.g., physical education and sports training) or in abnormal conditions (e.g., mTBI-associated balance disorders), be better performed late in the afternoon.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Child</kwd><kwd>postural control</kwd><kwd>posturography</kwd><kwd>diurnal patterns</kwd><kwd>trauma prevention</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Our health and wellbeing are influenced by a wide range of factors, including socio-economic status, cultural background, psychological health and environmental hazards. These factors are changing dynamically as we progress through the key transition points in life, from infancy and childhood, through our teenage years, to adulthood, working life, retirement and the end of life. Along with these transition changes in life, the capacity of postural control that is a prerequisite for performing routine physical activities such as walking, going up stairs, picking up an object from the floor or catching up yourself when the bus is coming to a sudden halt is also changing.<table-wrap id="TabA"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="2">Access this article online</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2">

It has been documented that normal postural control largely relies on the integrated information of the vestibular, visual and somatosensorial systems[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and that mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) may seriously impair postural control.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] Given the demonstrated relationship between postural control and physiopathology of the brain, assessment of aberrant postural control against normal postural control may be of a significant clinical importance in the diagnosis of brain lesions including mTBI. Accordingly, normal postural control in healthy subjects needs to be better understood.</p><p>Like many physiological processes, the level of postural control varies with physical, bio-mechanical, metabolical and psychosocial conditions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] To date, most studies on postural control are conducted in adult subjects, in whom impaired postural control has been demonstrated to be associated with fatigue and lack of sleep;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] postural control in children is relatively less studied.

To this end, 3 recordings of 10 seconds each were performed in 4 different conditions: Open eyes on a stable solid ground, open eyes on a foam rubber, closed eyes on a solid ground, and closed eyes on a foam rubber, respectively. The speed of oscillation in each test was expressed as degrees per second.

The localization of the subject&#x02019;s center of gravity was represented on the screen by a cursor allowing a visual feedback. The patient had to lean quickly and accurately from the center rest position to eight peripheral targets set out every 45&#x000b0; and briefly maintain stability at those positions [Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>].<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3:</label><caption><p>Screen of the computer during the test of stability limits, representing the localization of the peripheral targets and allowing the visual feedback.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41038_2014_20030130_Fig3" id="d30e384"/></fig></p><p>In each test, the subject was asked to move his center of gravity to a peripheral target for 8 seconds. The subject was allowed to do pre-test practice needed to achieve a good control of the cursor by the movements of the center of gravity.

The response time was expressed as the duration in seconds between the movement start signal (appearance of a circle inside of a peripheral target) and the beginning of the actual movement, EPE as the distance in percent of the balance limits, representing the initial attempt to reach a peripheral target, and MXE also as distance in percent of the balance limits, representing the longest distance ran by the center of gravity throughout the test. Accordingly, EPE represented the capacity to anticipate the movement (<italic>feedforward</italic>) and MXE the capacity of correcting the movement (<italic>feedback</italic>). The speed of movement represented the average quickness of movement of the center of gravity, expressed in degrees per second, between 5% and 95% of EPE. The directional control, expressed in percentage, represented the proportion of movement exclusively directed towards the target throughout the shifting of the center of gravity towards the target.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Rhythmic weight shifts (RWS)</title><p>To evaluate the quality of execution of swinging rhythmic movements of the center of gravity antero-posterior and lateral at 3 different given speeds (3, 2 and 1 second of transition), RWS test was conducted.

This piece of information would be of particular importance to future studies or clinical trials on postural control where the optimal timing of assessment needs to be decided.</p><p>Numerous physiological functions undergo diurnal variations that obey a circadian rhythm.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] Within a cycle of 24 hours, the metabolic and cognitive processes that intervene in the intellectual and physical activities vary.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] As a result, individually optimal time windows within a cycle may exist for different aspects of human activities.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] In adult subjects, the strength, the response time, the body temperature and the cardiac beat, in relation with the physical activity, sports performances and the cognitive capabilities, are all at the optimal level in the afternoon up to early evening.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]</p><p>In this study, the static postural control on bipedal stance, evaluated by the measurements of the speeds of oscillation by the test mCTSIB on a hard or a foam rubber surface, did not vary significantly between morning and afternoon. Likewise, the influence of eye closing was not significant at morning and afternoon hours either. It can be ventured to hypothesize that within the frame of our work, the fatigue accumulated throughout a day of school has no influence on the quality of proprioception, regardless of the surface nature of the stance, and on the way to handle the absence of visual information.</p><p>The results from previous studies on adult subjects are inconsistent. Gribble <italic>et al.</italic> showed that the static postural control was influenced highly by the time of the day (i.e., a better control in the morning and systematically worse control around 6 p.m.) but less by the degree of fatigue related to the lack of sleep.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] On the contrary, Nakano <italic>et al.</italic> reported that the speed of oscillation of the center of gravity increased at a significantly greater extent way with closed eyes and at the time when the rectal temperature was low (e.g., between 5 a.m. and 8 a.m.), suggesting that low body temperature in the morning may lead to a dysfunction of the muscles essential to the maintenance of body balance.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]</p><p>In this study, we also showed that the unilateral stance balance was relatively stable in children during a typical school day with no significant difference between morning and afternoon. In the study of Gribble <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], however, the static postural control, on unilateral stance, was demonstrated to be better in the morning. This observation is not only inconsistent with our finding in this regard but also surprisingly conflicting with these authors&#x02019; own data on the time for optimal sports performance in the afternoon and early evening. These authors suggest that a better static postural control on unilateral stance in the morning might be associated with a better cognitive functionality, following a circadian rhythm, thus allowing for a sustained focus in the morning. Nevertheless, both this study and the study of Gribble <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] showed that the influence of eye closing was not different between early morning and late afternoon.</p><p>In addition to the assessment of static postural control, we also performed the dynamic LOS test that evaluates motor and cognitive capabilities to respond to the complex task to initiate a movement, with certain accuracy, in function of a visual stimulus. We demonstrated that the dynamic postural control was surprisingly stable between morning and afternoon (especially for the combined results), inconsistent with the observation of Gribble <italic>et al.</italic> in this aspect.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] These authors suggest that opposed to the static postural control, dynamic postural control would require more important muscular contractions to process the requested task and these contractions are stronger in the afternoon.</p><p>An inverted proportional relationship between the speed and the accuracy at which a repeated test is done, particularly with the accuracy that would be worse in the early evening, has been proposed.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] To assess this relationship in healthy school children in this study, we performed RWS test. Our results showed that the directional control that represents the accuracy of the movement did not vary significantly between morning and afternoon when the swinging is antero-posterior, even though it is better at afternoon concerning the lateral swing. This observation is against the notion that accuracy performances are better in the morning. We speculate that if the performance accuracy varies during the day (being better in the morning), a sort of compensation would occur through enhancement in physical and motor capabilities or by the effect of learning. In terms of the motor capability, the dorsal flexion of the ankle, is a prime factor of success of antero-posterior swinging movements.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] However, it seems that the dorsal flexion of the ankle, in the adult, does not vary with the circadian rhythm[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and would be stable throughout the day instead. In terms of the lateral swinging, the improvement in the directional control might be explained by a possible learning curve which, in an unexplainable manner does not appear in the antero-posterior swing, and also by the significant difference in body weight distributions observed between morning and afternoon. In the morning, there was no predominance in the body weight distribution but was more on the left side in the afternoon, even though the children in this study were all right-handed. This observation is in-line with the results from the study of Matsusaka <italic>et al.</italic> where the left leg dominance was demonstrated in the majority of right-handed children.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] Described as &#x02018;dominant&#x02019;, the lower left limb in the children in the study of Matsusak <italic>et al.</italic> was believed to function to stabilize the static balance and to control the medio-lateral balance when walking.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]</p><p>In our study, it is interesting to note that it does not seem to exist a preferential foot of support in the morning, when at night the body weight distribution is done more specifically on the left side. The morning tests have been done very early, between 7 and 8 a.m., shortly after waking up. It can then be asked if the fact of having been in a laying down position during several hours prior does not mask the left or right handedness of the lower limbs. Nothing in the literature has been found on the subject and therefore, it is just an hypothesis. One other aspect is that in the test of RWS, the directional control is getting significantly better for the lateral swing when there is no significant improvement in the antero-posterior movements. This observation seems to support the hypothesis that a reinforcement of the dominant side (in this study the left side for all right-handed children) throughout the day may consequently result in better mediolateral balance capabilities.</p><p>One limitation of this study is associated with the concern over the reproducibility of the measurements on the Balance Master&#x000ae; in children. Another limitation is the small sample size used.</p><p>In summary, for the first time in this study, we have characterized diurnal changes in postural control in healthy school-aged children through computerized static and dynamic assessments and have demonstrated that the postural control pattern during a typical school day in children is different from that in adults. Given the causative role for mild brain trauma in postural control impairment, assessment of alterations in postural control against the postural control pattern characterized for health young children in this study would be helpful to the diagnosis of mild brain trauma, which remains a significant clinical challenge. Nevertheless, our findings warrant further validation in more studies, involving the use of a larger sample size and more reproducible assessment methods.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>

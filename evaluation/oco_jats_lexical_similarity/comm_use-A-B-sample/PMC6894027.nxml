The growth, development, and migration of living things require this magnetic field. Human activities are inextricably linked to the Earth's magnetic field as well. At present, about 3.5 million people die of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases each year in China, accounting for over 40% of the total number of deaths due to various causes<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. Studies have shown that the occurrence and development of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases are closely related to the geomagnetic field, but the specific mechanism of influence is not yet clear<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. The traditional research methods can't explain the mechanism of geomagnetic activity on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Therefore, this project intends to simulate geomagnetic activity and study the response of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MI/RI) in rats to this geomagnetic activity. It will provide a new way to study the relationship between geomagnetic activities and cardiovascular diseases. And the results of this study can provide a new idea to treat the patients with MI/RI, when there is a geomagnetic outbreak.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Animal and Ethical Statement</title><p>The present study used eight to ten-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River), weighing 200&#x000b1;20 g, which were obtained from the Experimental Animal Center of the Kunming Medical University (Kunming, Yunnan, China) and were housed in the Laboratory Animal Center of the Kunming Medical University. Animal experimental protocols were approved and performed according to the guidelines of the Institutional Medical Experimental Animal Care Committee of the Kunming Medical University. Guidelines for Laboratory Animal Care and Safety from the United States National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, Maryland, USA) were also followed.</p></sec><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>Triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) was obtained from the Sigma-Aldrich Corporation (Missouri, USA). Kits for detecting lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), and troponin I (cTnI) were purchased from AU Clinical Chemistry Systems of the Beckman Coulter Inc. company (California, USA). The kit for detecting melatonin was purchased from the Abcam Inc. company (ab213978, Abcam, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Equipment</title><p>The geomagnetic experimental platform consists of four partial compositions, including a metal shielding experiment cage, radiation antenna, programmable signal generator, and control computer. The signal generator controlled by the main control computer can produce below 50 Hz and an arbitrary combination of signal spectra, especially analog Schumann resonances and geomagnetic burst, in the space of electromagnetic radiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>).

The rats in each place were divided into sham operation group and operation group, being nine rats in each group. The shield+sham group, radiation+sham group, normal+sham group, and normal+operation group were the control group. The shield+operation group and radiation+operation group were the experimental group.</p></sec><sec><title>MI/RI Protocol</title><p>The MI/RI model was generated and utilized as previously described<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. Rats were anesthetized using an intraperitoneal injection of 3.6% chloral hydrate (1 ml/kg) and ventilated isoflurane gas via tracheal intubation, with an RWD rodent respirator. Body temperature was maintained at 37&#x000ba;C via a heated operating table. MI/RI surgery was performed using the following procedure: the heart was exteriorized by a left thoracic incision, and a slipknot (6-0 silk) was placed and ligated around the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. The slipknot was released after 30 min of ischemia, and after that the animal received 24 hours of reperfusion. Ischemia was confirmed by noting the change in color of myocardial tissue in the ischemic area, and reperfusion was achieved by loosening the knot. The MI/RI rats were placed in different places for 24 hours of reperfusion, and then their physiological and biochemical indicators were tested.</p></sec><sec><title>Myocardial Infarct Sizes</title><p>Following reperfusion, the heart was then excised, both atria and the right ventricle were removed, and the left ventricle was cut into five equal slices to create cross sections from apex to base. The slices were separated into normal zone and area at risk, both followed by incubation in 1% TTC to measure the viability of myocardial tissue. Viable tissue stained red, while nonviable tissue remained unstained or was white (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). Infarct size as a percentage of area at risk was determined gravimetrically.</p><p><fig id="f2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Heart physiological indexes.

A vast number of large-scale clinical observational experiments show that when there was a geomagnetic outbreak, arrhythmia, hypertension, myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction, stroke, and other cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events increased significantly<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. The mechanisms of the geomagnetic field on the cardiovascular function are studies that became very meaningful. Based on the discovered mechanism, we will prevent the geomagnetic effects and reduce the probability of cardiovascular diseases.</p><p>MI/RI lead to ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>. From our experimental results, there was no significant difference on the myocardial infarction area between the shielding + operation group and radiation + operation group, but the LVDP and &#x000b1; dP/dtmax in the radiation + operation group were lower than in the shielding + operation group and normal + operation group, and the LEVDP in the shielding + operation group was higher than in the normal + operation group, indicating that geomagnetic shielding can help to improve heart function and geomagnetic radiation can increase the damage in the heart function.</p><p>During MI/RI, myocardial oxygen free radicals accumulate, calcium overload occurs, and the myocardium produces a large amount of oxygen free radicals. These oxygen free radicals convert to hydroxyl free radicals, which act on the cell membrane and change the myocardial cell membrane structure and function. The cells release large amounts of LDH and CK, and they are specific indicators of myocardial injury<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>. From our experimental results, there are significant differences on CK between the shielding + operation group and radiation + operation group. This shows that geomagnetic activity has an impact on CK. We speculate that geomagnetic activity affects myocardial energy metabolism, muscle contraction, and adenosine triphosphate regeneration, because CK is correlated to those.</p><p>The cTnI is considered as the key biochemical marker in the diagnosis of myocardial injury. Patients with myocardial infarction have much higher concentrations of cTnI than healthy people<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>. From the experimental results, cTnI in the radiation + operation group is higher than in the shielding + operation group, indicating that geomagnetic radiation has an increasing effect on cTnI, while geomagnetic shielding has an inhibitory effect on cTnI, which proves that geomagnetic radiation has the potential to aggravate myocardial injury. Geomagnetic shielding has a protective effect on myocardial injury.</p><p>Melatonin has a powerful antioxidant effect and a high degree of diffusive penetration ability, which can exert its own antioxidant effect on the cell membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus to protect the myocardial tissue against oxidative damage. From the experimental results, the concentration of melatonin in the radiation - operation group is lower than in the shielding + operation group and normal + operation group, indicating that geomagnetic radiation can reduce its protective effect on myocardial injury by inhibiting melatonin secretion. At the same time, the geomagnetic shield can promote the secretion of melatonin and enhance the protective effect of melatonin on myocardial injury<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The geomagnetic activity-related heat exposure is associated with an increase in cardiac events.

decides whether to attend an event.</p><p>In 2017, we held the 44<sup>th</sup> Congress of the Sociedade Brasileira de Cirurgia
Cardiovascular (SBCCV), in Rio de Janeiro, under skepticism, scarcity of resources and
many doubts about the future of this activity, or even about the specialty itself.</p><p>The Congress was a success. It exceeded the expectation of the number of participants,
added many new speakers and presenters of scientific subjects and impressed by the
quality of the presentations of the national and international speakers. The policy
adopted was to prioritize the scientific quality, to include young surgeons and to
discuss the topics of the current reality and practice of the specialty. Sessions of
short answers were emphasized for relevant questions, discussion of clinical trials
impacting the surgical practice and presentation of original themes, both in the form of
commented posters and in original oral presentations. Students and residents had their
special, high-quality activities.</p><p>The 45<sup>th</sup> Congress of the SBCCV will be held in Goi&#x000e2;nia, from 19 to 21
April, 2018. The preliminary program is outlined and first line international guests are
confirmed. We hope to perfect the formula, increase the focus on innovation and promote
the face-to-face discussion of the topics that most concern and afflict the Brazilian
cardiovascular surgeon at the moment.</p><p>On the questions put at the beginning of this editorial: where will the truth be? It can
emerge from the broad, frank, qualified and face-to-face discussion, confronting data,
criticism, and mixed experiences of young and experienced surgeons.</p><p>And what is a congress for? Clearly, it is the democratic opportunity to filter, from the
myriad of information, what can be used and applied in surgical practice, aiming at our
professional priority objective, which is the greatest benefit of the patient.</p><p>This is how SBCCV acts: understanding that one of its objectives is to promote education
and access to innovation.</p><p>We look forward to your presence at our next congress.</p></body></article>

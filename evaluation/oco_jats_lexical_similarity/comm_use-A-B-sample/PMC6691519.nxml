<bold>Results</bold>
</p><p id="Par58">Burns department should be incorporated into medical rescue contingency plans of local public emergencies, and burn specialty team should be organized. Triage and primary triage transfer is the first link of medical emergency at the disaster scene or at the emergency room of the first receiving hospital. The disaster site incident headquarters should call the nearest burns department and the hospital with the necessary care competence according to the situation of triage and evacuate of casualty. For the MBCD that can be not rapidly shunted nearby, especially the severely burned patients, the headquarters should coordinate and organize protraction of specialized technical force, and then organize to implement the normative early management in local hospital. After spending steadily the shock stage or making up blood volume, the burn patients should be secondarily triaged and transferred to the burn center in&#x000a0;soonest&#x000a0;possible. Normative fluid resuscitation should be persistently performed in each links of MBCD triage and transfer. The treatment strategies for extensive deep burns wound of early MBCD should aim at stabilizing and controlling patient&#x02019;s condition firstly, carry out the concept of damage control operation, and perform tangential excision and alloskin or xenoskin grafting for temporary coverage and later on autoskin grafting.</p><p id="Par59">

<bold>Background</bold>
</p><p id="Par69">Burn injuries are prevalent and devastating, be it for the patient, their family, the community or the country. The effects are far-reaching. With proper measures, ranging from prevention to rehabilitation, burn outcomes can be dramatically improved. This study aims to look at the effectiveness of burns management in Dhaka, a fast-developing capital.</p><p id="Par70">
<bold>Materials and Methods</bold>
</p><p id="Par71">Interviews were conducted one-to-one with a translator present at all times, specifically targeting nurses. Nurses were randomly selected while they were working in the Burns Unit at Dhaka Medical College Hospital. Verbal consent was taken prior to the interview.</p><p id="Par72"><bold>Results</bold>30 Nurses participated in the survey. 20% were males while 80% are females. 70% (21) of their language medium of choice was English. 10% (3) was other languages and 20% (6) was Bengali. The types of burn injuries witnessed by this group of nurses include thermal (28), electrical (19), chemical (16), friction (15), radiation (2), lightning (2) and cold injury/frost bite (1). Thermal injuries were frequently caused by fire from cooking stove and open fires. The most common cause was poor layout in terms of house kitchen as well as city planning. Stoves were placed hazardously in households, often in make-shift kitchens and sometimes on the floor. It did not help that women wore sarees. There was the practice of burning rubbish in the open, at will, with no designated area, safety rules or regulations from the government. Also, women were known to practise perineal warming after giving birth by sitting over or near fires. 2 nurses attributed poor burn outcomes to religious practices, stating that Muslim women had the tendency to present late for treatment. There was also inadequate understanding of first aid among the community. Majority (23) thought that inadequate general public awareness was the most important social cause for burns. The complication of burns which patients complained the most was infection. In order of importance, nurses were ranked the most important in spreading awareness, followed by patients, then doctors, then teachers/instructors, state governors and lastly country politicians. 17 (56.7%) thought that doctors, instead of nurses should lead burns resuscitation whereas 29 (96.7%) thought that nurses should lead burns dressings.</p><p id="Par73">
<bold>Conclusions</bold>
</p><p id="Par74">Without a doubt, burns burden is high in Dhaka. Burns will not be managed effectively if one neglect the importance of primary prevention. Cultural practices need to be respected when formulating solutions. General public education can be reinforced, either by introducing burn programs into the school curriculum or broadcasting awareness clips in the social media. Measures need to be taken to reduce infection rates in burns.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Abstract Topic : Burns Education</title><sec id="Sec18"><title>S4 Inhalational Injury &#x02013; A Pictorial Grading</title><sec id="Sec19"><title>Delong Zeng<sup>1</sup>, Suneel Ramesh Desai<sup>2</sup>, Chong Si Jack<sup>3</sup></title><sec id="Sec20"><title><sup>1</sup>Department of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetics Surgery, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore; <sup>2</sup>Department of Anesthesiology and Surgical Intensive Care, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore; <sup>3</sup>Asia Pacific Burn Association, Bali, Indonesia</title><sec id="Sec21"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Delong Zeng</title><p id="Par75">
<bold>Background</bold>
</p><p id="Par76">Inhalational injury as a cause of burns, or explosions can have serious consequences if not identified quickly and managed properly. Early surveillance of airway is essential in managing their complications. The Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) for bronchoscopic evaluation is used for grading the severity of inhalational burns. This study aims to provide a visual representation of the different AIS grades to aid in airway evaluation, as well as, propose a workflow for anyone that comes to the Accident and Emergency (A&#x00026;E) department with possible inhalational burns.</p><p id="Par77">
<bold>Materials and Methods</bold>
</p><p id="Par78">Patients with varying degrees of inhalational injury were selected to represent the AIS grading. No patient was identified as AIS 4, therefore, a standard picture was used. These patients all underwent early evaluation of their airway with nasolaryngoscopy, followed by more detailed assessment with bronchoscopy.</p><p id="Par79">
<bold>Results</bold>
</p><p id="Par80">A pathway is devised for the management of patients with varying degrees of inhalational burn. Pictures are incorporated into the workflow to aid in visual guidance.</p><p id="Par81">
<bold>Conclusions</bold>
</p><p id="Par82">Clinical signs of airway injury can be non-specific, therefore, an upper airway nasolaryngoscopy is essential to evaluate the need for intubation. Lower airway bronchoscopy can be used to predict the likelihood of successful early extubation, or complications such as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome or pneumonia. A pictorial grading of inhalational injury, together with our management pathway, will greatly help the speed and effectiveness of treating burn patients when they first arrive to the hospital.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Abstract Topic: Burns Education</title><sec id="Sec23"><title>S5 A 5-year retrospective study of liquefied petroleum gas-related burn patients in China</title><sec id="Sec24"><title>Ronghua Jin, Jon Kee Ho, Chunmao Han</title><sec id="Sec25"><title>Department of Burns &#x00026; Wound Care Center, Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, College of Medicine, Hangzhou, China</title><sec id="Sec26"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Chunmao Han</title><p id="Par83">
<bold>Background</bold>
</p><p id="Par84">Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is a widely used environment-friendly fuel. According to the annual report of World Liquefied Petroleum Gas Association in 2015, China has become the world&#x02019;s second largest LPG-consuming country. Previous studies have shown an increasing number of LPG-related burns [1]. Our study was designed to evaluate the epidemiologic pattern of these injuries and provide recommendations for burn prevention.</p><p id="Par85">
<bold>Materials and Methods</bold>
</p><p id="Par86">Patient data was collected from the clinical database of patients with LPG-related burns from burn units of eight different hospitals in Zhejiang Province from January 2011 to December 2015. Database variables included patient demographics, accident characteristics and injury characteristics.</p><p id="Par87">
<bold>Results</bold>
</p><p id="Par88">This retrospective study included all patients with LPG-related burns in eight burn centers between 2011 and 2015. A total of 1898 patients were included, 47.31% were male and 52.69% were female. The predominant age group was 31~70 years (74.50%), majority were poorly educated and the incidence peaked from June to September. The most common place of occurrence was home (74.08%) and gas leak was the most common cause. The four limbs (43.33%) were the most frequently affected areas, the mean burn area was 25.19&#x000b1;20.97% of the total body surface area (TBSA) and most patients (46.89%) suffered from moderate burns. The mean length of hospital stay was 17.66&#x000b1;16.55 days and majority of patients (89.36%) recovered with 0.84% mortality rate.</p><p id="Par89">
<bold>Conclusions</bold>
</p><p id="Par90">Our findings reflected that the increase in incidence rate was alarming. Therefore, this calls for simple but strict measures to prevent these burn injuries. Gas leak was the main cause of LPG-related burns, any part of LPG stove system that shows signs of weathering should be replaced regularly.</p><p id="Par91">

<bold>Background</bold>
</p><p id="Par94">Burns is one of the most common injury in Bangladesh. The huge number of patients coupled with limited number of designated hospitals and skilled manpower resulted in death or severe complication in burns survivors. As such, the government had planned for a new designated burns hospital to meet national needs, and a multidisciplinary burns team in Singapore has agreed to provide training to build the capacity of specialised healthcare workforce for this new hospital and beyond. Training consists of a 5-day on-site teaching course that was planned to run 5 times over 3 years. It aims to train 310 nursing, doctor and rehabilitation specialists who in turn will train another 900 healthcare workers. The 5-day on-site training consists of lectures; live surgery demonstration; splinting workshop (hands-on); wound dressing workshop (hands-on); case scenario discussion and group presentations. A handbook was also published as training material to aid the delivery of the information. Curriculum is planned with inputs from both the Dhaka burns team and Singapore burns team. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of the training course.</p><p id="Par95">
<bold>Materials and Methods</bold>
</p><p id="Par96">The course was evaluated based on the Kirkpatrick&#x02019;s model of course evaluation. Data was collected on the participants&#x02019; reactions to the training with a post training questionnaire. A pre and post-course test was also conducted to determine the participants&#x02019; extent of knowledge gained.</p><p id="Par97">
<bold>Results</bold>
</p><p id="Par98">One hundred and forty-six participants attended the course. Seventy-four participants completed the post training questionnaire with 97 % of them rated the course as meeting or exceeding their expectation. Out of 79 participants who completed the pre and post-course test, 86% of them showed an improvement with 29% of them achieving an improvement of 30% in their test scores.</p><p id="Par99">

<bold>Background</bold>
</p><p id="Par110">Burns can lead to abundant fatalities. It may cause temporary and permanent disability. Initial fluid resuscitation is required to support burn patients. It is significantly beneficial for the patients, especially on the first 24 hours. In majority of cases, Parkland Formula is used. However, fluid administration based only on Parkland Formula could lead to less output of urine at certain conditions.</p><p id="Par111">
<bold>Materials and Methods</bold>
</p><p id="Par112">A comprehensive literature searching was done by the authors starting from October 25th 2018 using electronic databases PubMed, Medline, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane with key words including adults, Parkland Formula and urine output. Authors finally gathered 8 relevant articles. Cohort studies were critically appraised with Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment and randomized controlled trials used PEDro Scale.</p><p id="Par113">
<bold>Results</bold>
</p><p id="Par114">Literatures related to Parkland's Formula with its effects on urine output varying greatly. The types of studies consisted from cohort to randomized controlled trials. The subjects used also differ from human to adult animals, with several comparison objects, such as administration of intravenous hypertonic fluid, rehydrated oral fluids and bolus directly to the colon through the anus. Addition or reduction in the speed of entering fluid was often done and adjusted for the amount of urine output. There is no research that only relied to the 2-4 ml*weight*TBSA% formula. Increasing the infusion rate after the first 8 hours of 24-hour fluid resuscitation could significantly maintain the amount of urine output by 0.5&#x02013;1.0 ml/kg/hour. One study showed that hyperdynamic fluid resuscitation could significantly increase urine expenditure in the first 8 hours of subjects with 60% TBSA burns. Another trial concluded that the provision of WHO-ORS with S&#x000f8;rensen formula was effective in patients with 15% TBSA burns and could produce urine output as targeted.</p><p id="Par115">
<bold>Conclusions</bold>
</p><p id="Par116">From all the results shown, it can be directed that the Parkland Formula alone cannot be used as a standard.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec42"><title>Abstract Topic: Critical Care/Resuscitation and Pharmacology</title><sec id="Sec43"><title>S9 Role Of Acute Kidney Injury In Severely Burned Patients</title><sec id="Sec44"><title>Zhiqiang Yuan, Bo You, Gaoxing Luo, Yizhi Peng</title><sec id="Sec45"><title>Institute Of Burn Research, Southwest Hospital,Army Military Medical University,Chongqing,China</title><sec id="Sec46"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Zhiqiang Yuan</title><p id="Par117">

The appropriate timing and area of the wound excision should be chosen with the concept of damage control operation. Tangential excision is applicable to not only deep dermal but also full-thickness burn wounds. The depth of tangential excision should effectively remove necrotic tissues and reach down to the level of the underlying viable dermis or subcutaneous tissue. Tourniquet can be not used during limb tangential excision surgery, instead, the wounded limb has been kept elevated as much as possible. If fresh wound after tangential excision is still obviously dropsical, multipoint puncture reaching down to fascia should be performed for drainage. The wound after tangential excision within 14 days especially 7 days post burn should be grafted with viable alloskin or xenoskin for temporary coverage and later on autoskin. Grafting of autologous microskin overlain with sheet alloskin should be applied onto the wound after tangential excision, of which the blood supply tend to be improved after 7 days post burn. Perioperative especially intraoperative management should be strengthened.</p><p id="Par171">

For patients whose perfusion is not still restored, those with fourth-degree burns, or signs of osteofascial compartment syndrome, a fasciotomy should be performed in time. For dosal hand deep dermal burns or full-thickness burns, tangential excision and medium thickness sheet auto-skin grafting should be performed as early as possible, which should focus on repair of opisthenar and dorsal finger&#x000a0;and design reasonable surgical range. For palmar burns, it is necessary to wait 2&#x02013;3 weeks for healing. If not, full-thickness or thick sheet auto-skin grafting should be performed. Before and after surgery, HDB should be treated by dressing change with local&#x000a0;anti-infection, proper compression and elevation. And desiccation of finger ends should be avoided. During upper limb tangential excision surgery, tourniquet cannot be applied to limb. Hand joints should be kept in the position of confrontation contracture.

The two most common burn injuries were thermal (15) and electrical burns (15). 100% agreed that thermal burns were more prevalent than electrical burns. Other types of burns reported were chemical (9), friction (7), radiation (2), lightning (1) and abuse (1). 100% of them agreed that there were not enough safety precautions in place to prevent electrical burns. 80% of them thought that education was lacking in the community. Other popular causes reported were inadequate general public awareness (73%, 11), overcrowding in poor housing conditions (67%, 10), poor education levels (53%, 8) and poor city/home layout/hazard placements (53%, 8). 11 (73.3%) thought that doctors, instead of nurses should lead Burns Resuscitation and 9 (60%) thought that doctors, instead of nurses should lead Burns Dressings. According to this group of local doctors, the complication of Burn Injuries which patients complain the most of was disfigurement.</p><p id="Par202">
<bold>Conclusions</bold>
</p><p id="Par203">The high prevalence of burns, undeniably is attributed to anthropogenic reasons. Thus, burns are preventable, excluding that caused by natural disasters for example in this study, lightning. The consensus among these Dhaka doctors is that much effort is still needed to help the burns community. While the Dhaka authorities formulate their policies and plan their city, the authors recognise that a new tertiary level hospital is on the way in Dhaka.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec96"><title>Abstract Topic: Infection Control and Diseases</title><sec id="Sec97"><title>S20 Lytic Bacteriophage Screening Strategies against Multidrug Resistant Bloodstream Infections from an Intensive Care Unit of Southwest China Burn Treatment Center</title><sec id="Sec98"><title>Zichen Yang, Liuyang Deng, Supeng Yin, Bei Jiang, Yulong Zhang, Bo You, Cheng Zhang, Xiaoqiang Luo, Yizhi Peng, Yali Gong</title><sec id="Sec99"><title>State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Chongqing Key Laboratory for Proteomics Disease, Institute of Burn Research, Southwest Hospital, the Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University), Chongqing 400038, China</title><sec id="Sec100"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Yali Gong</title><p id="Par204">

</p><p id="Par297">The period of research is from January 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018. The findings are as follows: (1) " Empathy" is a key element in the continuation of nursing and a factor that causes compassion fatigue. (2) Symptoms of compassion fatigues (such as physical and mental fatigue, anxiety, etc.) will affect the nurses, showing a lack of sense of accomplishment, want to escape and other characteristics; if not properly resolved, will lead to personal trapped in negative emotions.(3) The caregiver is afraid of family concerns and is solely responsible for the fatigue that is not seen. (4) The mutual support of the burn team members has become a major factor in reducing compassion fatigues.</p><p id="Par298">
<bold>Conclusions</bold>
</p><p id="Par299">Under the pressure of high compassion fatigues, it will affect the motivation of continuous service in the burn center. Therefore, the supervisor should pay attention to and care for the nurses, continue to provide psychological support, and infuse positive energy. The nurses also need to identify themselves. Support each other then will coexist.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec155"><title>Abstract Topic: Nursing Care in Burn Centre</title><sec id="Sec156"><title>S32 Project to Improving the Nurses Working Overtime----A Medical Center Burn ICU in Taiwan</title><sec id="Sec157"><title>Chen-Chun Chen, Meng-Jung Chuang, Ling-Yin Chiu, Feng-Mei Tseng</title><sec id="Sec158"><title>Nursing Department, National Cheng Kung University Hospital , Tainan, Taiwan</title><sec id="Sec159"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Chen-Chun Chen</title><p id="Par300">

</p><p id="Par317">Analgesia during burn dressing change is indispensable. Fentanyl has great analgesic potency and short onset of action. Fentanyl has been commonly used for analgesia during burn dressing changes in the United States. Today, the most common analgesic method is patient-controlled analgesia, however, nurse-controlled analgesia method is also used and differences between the two methods in their analgesic efficacy and side effects were statistically insignificant. Up to now, however, in Viet Nam, there hasn&#x02019;t been any report of nurse-controlled analgesia with fentanyl for burn dressing changes. Therefore, we conducted this study with the aim of evaluating the effectiveness and safety of nurse-controlled analgesia with fentanyl for burn dressing changes.</p><p id="Par318">

</p><p id="Par329">The success rate of the first implantation in the observation group was higher than the control group (x2 = 14.4, P = 0.00015 &#x0003c; 0.05); implantation time in the observation group was significantly shorter than the control group (t = 5.665, P &#x0003c; 0.05); the incidence of subcutaneous hemorrhage in the observation group was lower than the control group (x2 = 9.882, P = 0.00167 &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p id="Par330">
<bold>Conclusions</bold>
</p><p id="Par331">PICC provides an ideal venous access for children with severe burns and solves difficulties on peripheral venous catheterization in children. However, the poor coordination in children reduces the success rate of catheter implantation, and increases the incidence of mechanical phlebitis and venous thrombosis after catheterization. The ultrasound-guided implantation of PICC is a safe and practical catheterized method, which ensures the treatment of children with a increasing success rate. The upper elbow catheter implantation can avoid the traction and friction of the catheter effectively when children moving, reduce the occurrence of complications after catheterization, and open up a new intravenous way for the treatment of children with severe burns.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec175"><title>Abstract Topic: Nursing Care in Burn Centre</title><sec id="Sec176"><title>S36 The Effectiveness of Supervised Exercise Training for Venous Leg Ulcer: A Quasi-Experimental Study</title><sec id="Sec177"><title>Shu-Fen, Kao</title><sec id="Sec178"><title>Head Nurse, Burn Center, Department of Nursing, Taipei Veterans General Hospital ,Taiwan</title><p id="Par332">

Such an approach is quite limited for PICC studies of burn children.</p><p id="Par342">
<bold>Materials and Methods</bold>
</p><p id="Par343">From February 2014 to August 2018, retrospective analysis was performed for 76 burn children with implanted PICC at our department. The relevant data included general demographics, catheter characteristics and complications.</p><p id="Par344">
<bold>Results</bold>
</p><p id="Par345">The age range was 3 to 120 months. A total of 79 single-lumen 3/4F catheters were implanted. The insertion sites were non-femoral vein (25 catheters, n=22) and femoral vein (54 catheters, n=54). The mean indwelling duration of non-femoral and femoral veins was 27.28(9-47) and 22.33(2-130) days respectively. Inter-group statistical differences existed in insertion mode and insertion length (P&#x0003c;0.05). In non-femoral venous catheterization group, insertion was blind (n=14, 56.0%) and ultrasound-guided (n=11, 44.0%); in femoral venous catheterization group, placement was blind (n=54, 100%). There were statistically significant inter-group differences in puncturing mode and indwelling duration (P&#x0003c;0.05). The overall incidence of PICC complication was 17.7%. Neither group had any occurrence of catheter-related infections. Based upon generalized linear model, no inter-group statistical differences existed in adjusted age, burn area, hospitalization length, number of operation, puncturing mode or complication (P=0.498&#x0003e;0.05). All children were cured and discharged.</p><p id="Par346">

<bold>Background</bold>
</p><p id="Par406">Propranolol has been shown to be efficacious modulator of post burn cardiac response and increase muscle protein synthesis in severely burned children. However, safety, efficacy and optimum dose in adults are less well established. The primary objective of our study is to investigate the safety of propranolol in adults with &#x02265;20% TBSA burns. The secondary objective is to determine the propranolol dose levels that are tolerated by our local population.</p><p id="Par407">
<bold>Materials and Methods</bold>
</p><p id="Par408">We retrospectively reviewed medical records of burn patients between 21 - 65 years old with &#x02265; 20% TBSA burns that were on propranolol from January 2010 to October 2017. Propranolol dose and patient clinical data were obtained from hospital electronic medical records. Hypotension is defined as SBP &#x0003c; 100 or MAP &#x0003c; 60 mm Hg, and bradycardia as HR &#x0003c; 60 bpm. Descriptive statistics were used to report results.</p><p id="Par409">

</p><p id="Par410">Forty-one patients met the inclusion criteria with median age of 31 years, median burn size of 50% TBSA and 39% had inhalational injury. Mortality was 19.5%. Median time to propranolol initiation was 3 days from hospital admission, Median episode of dose held was 4 per treatment course. Low blood pressure accounted for 39.8% propranolol dose withheld. Less than 5% dose withheld was associated with bradycardia, 25.9% due to nil by mouth or in operation, 28.9% with no reason stated. Some 43.9% of patient required vasopressor at some point.

Importantly, treatment with GSK-J4, can reverse the diabetic ulcer sera- induced senescence and G2-M phase arrest via restoring the H3K27me2/3 levels. We measured the expression of factors related to senescence, cell cycle arrest and cell migration. We found that eNOS, RAGE122, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, IL-12 and TNF-&#x003b1; gene expressions were significantly up-regulated by diabetic sera and GSK-J4 treatment reversed effects.

</p><p id="Par506">Patients in the general ward undergoing SSG were recruited. Allevyn and Betaplast were applied on the same donor site after SSG harvesting. Dressings were secured using OPSITE film and bandage. Absorptive capacity was assessed daily using an absorbency grading chart. Dressing change was done on POD 5. Ease of dressing removal was assessed with a visual chart, and pain score using the Wong-Baker Pain Scale. The percentage of full re-epithelization in terms of surface area for each dressing was assessed.</p><p id="Par507">
<bold>Results</bold>
</p><p id="Par508">The exudate absorption of Allevyn and Betaplast comparing between POD 1 and POD 5 was significant (P&#x0003c;0.05), indicating that both dressings continued to absorb exudate from POD 1 to POD 5. When comparing absorption from one POD to the subsequent POD, absorption for Allevyn was significant (P&#x0003c;0.05) only from POD 1 till POD 4, while absorption for Betaplast remained significant (P&#x0003c;0.05) from POD 1 until POD 5. There was no significant difference (p=0.05) between Betaplast and Allevyn for the percentage of re-epithelization. Descriptive statistics indicated higher mean percentage for Betaplast (mean= 62.73%) compared to Allevyn (mean= 49.09%), with 7 out of the 11 patients having better re-epithelization with Betaplast.

<bold>Background</bold>
</p><p id="Par520">Deep burn-wound undergoes a dynamic progression in the initial or peri-burn area after insults. The stasis zone has a higher risk of deterioration and is considered as a salvageable target for burn-wound progression. Although multiple efforts have been made to understand mechanism and treatment, few work explores the role of mitochondrial damage in this process and potential self-protection within human body.</p><p id="Par521">
<bold>Materials and Methods</bold>
</p><p id="Par522">A classic&#x0201c;comb&#x0201d;burn rat model was established in this study for further assessments. Hemodynamic and pathological evaluations were performed with helps of Laser speckle imaging and Hematoxylin and eosin staining. The changes of oxidative stress and apoptosis in the zone of stasis were detected by commercial kits. Mitochondrial damage and mitophagy were studied based on the results of transmission electron microscope and western blots. Fluorescence-labelled adenovirus for HIF-1&#x003b1; silence was applied to clarify the role of HIF-1&#x003b1; on regulating mitophagy in the zone of stasis.</p><p id="Par523">
<bold>Results</bold>
</p><p id="Par524">We found burn insults bring about typical ischemia and histological deterioration in the zone of stasis, in parallel with increases of oxidative stress and apoptosis. It was also found some clues about the involvement of mitochondrial damage in aforementioned changes. Furthermore, we detected typical mitophagy in burn-wound in the early stage after injury, presenting an opposite fluctuation to the conversion of burn-wound. Finally, we suggested HIF-1&#x003b1; is a key regulator on mitophagy in the zone of stasis with downstream involvement of BNIP3 and PARKIN.</p><p id="Par525">
<bold>Conclusions</bold>
</p><p id="Par526">Hence, we demonstrate burn-induced mitochondrial impairment contributes to the mobilization of injurious mechanism in the zone of stasis and mitophagy provides a way to protect against burn-wound progression via eliminating damaged mitochondria. Furthermore, our findings offer insights in mitochondrial quality control in burn-wound progression and suggest a novel concept that HIF-1&#x003b1; could be a potential therapeutic target in view of its regulation on BNIP3 or PARKIN-mediated mitophagy upstream.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec292"><title>Abstract Topic: Others</title><sec id="Sec293"><title>S60 Severe burn injury alters intestinal microbiota composition and impairs intestinal barrier in mice</title><sec id="Sec294"><title>Yanhai Feng<sup>1</sup>, Yalan Huang<sup>2</sup>, Yu Wang<sup>3</sup>, Pei Wang<sup>1</sup>, Fengjun Wang<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec295"><title><sup>1</sup>State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns, and Combined Injury, Institute of Burn Research, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University) , Chongqing, China; <sup>2</sup>Department of Military Nursing, School of Nursing, Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University), Chongqing, China; <sup>3</sup>Department of Gastroenterology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University), Chongqing, China</title><sec id="Sec296"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Yanhai Feng</title><p id="Par527">

<bold>Background</bold>
</p><p id="Par585">There has been an increased use of personal mobility devices (PMD) and power-assisted bicycles (PAB) in Singapore as alternative transportation modes. However, such devices carry fire risks. This study aims to investigate the impact of PMD/PAB-related fires to the health of the users, and to describe some notable cases attended by the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) Emergency Medical Services (EMS) over the 2 year-period in 2017 and 2018.</p><p id="Par586">
<bold>Materials and Methods</bold>
</p><p id="Par587">PMD/PAB-related fires attended by SCDF were identified through a retrospective review of fire investigation reports by SCDF Fire Research Unit (FRU). Where the fires resulted in injuries, the EMS patient records were studied. Variables studied include injury type, severity, and injured body region. Three notable cases resulting with partial thickness burns and classified as Patient Acuity Category 1 (PAC 1) are described in this study.</p><p id="Par588">
<bold>Results</bold>
</p><p id="Par589">Out of 123 cases of PMD/PAB-related fire incidents, 17 cases resulted in 44 injured persons, with 7 cases involved multiple casualties. 34 casualties were conveyed to the hospital, of which 7 (20.6%) were classified as PAC 1. 47.1% of the patients sustained only smoke inhalation injuries, and the remaining sustained burn injuries only or both. Most commonly, the upper limbs were injured. One notable case involved an adult patient who sustained smoke inhalation injury and 50% partial thickness burn over the head, face, torso and all limbs. Two paediatric patients sustained 40% and 7% partial thickness burn injuries respectively, affecting mostly the torso and limbs. In all cases, the patients were in the same room where the devices were being charged when they caught fire.</p><p id="Par590">
<bold>Conclusions</bold>
</p><p id="Par591">Although PMDs and PABs offer convenience and increased mobility, the fire risk, especially during the electrical charging process, carries significant impact on public health. Increased public education may be needed to manage the fire hazards related to such devices.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec331"><title>Abstract Topic: Others</title><sec id="Sec332"><title>S68 The Use of ImageJ to Calculate Total Body Surface Area in Burn Patients: A Case Series</title><sec id="Sec333"><title>Aditya Wardhana, Rizta A.

<bold>Background</bold>
</p><p id="Par593">Assessing the total body surface area (TBSA) of burn has been a matter of clinical judgment even though some modalities now serve as adjunct tools to increase accuracy. We compared the result between clinical judgment from an experienced burn surgeon (&#x0003e;10 years in the field) and manual calculations using ImageJ.</p><p id="Par594">
<bold>Materials and Methods</bold>
</p><p id="Par595">We conducted the study in the burn unit of Cipto Mangunkusomo Hospital, Jakarta. Using transparent dressing, we traced the border of each wound and the area is measured using &#x0201c;ROI Manager&#x0201d; in ImageJ. The overall BSA of each patient was calculated using the Dubois Formula as the denominator to determine the percentage of burn. The result from ImageJ calculation is then compared to the Rule of Nine.</p><p id="Par596">
<bold>Results</bold>
</p><p id="Par597">Data was collected in the first day post injury of 3 patients, all with partial to full-thickness burn. Patient A was a normoweight female with 36% burn clinically and 34.7% from ImageJ. Patient B was an obese female with 25% burn clinically and 32% from ImageJ. Patient C was an overweight female with 10% burn and 8.5% from ImageJ. In 2 patients, measurements are quite identical with &#x0003c;2% difference.

<bold>Background</bold>
</p><p id="Par610">Burn injury is considered as one of major problem because of high mortality and morbidity, not only due to improper treatment of burn resuscitation during the first 24 hours, but also due to the extent and depth of burns itself. The right depth of wound determines the next action whether the burn will be excised or not. Determining the depth of burns clinically is a learning curve and less accurate because it depends on the experience of the surgeon. A method is needed to make clinical assessment more objective in determining burn wound depth.</p><p id="Par611">
<bold>Materials and Methods</bold>
</p><p id="Par612">We did clinical and thermography assessment using Flir One&#x000ae; thermal imager to determine the conversion of burn depth of patient before and after the surgery. Subsequently, temperature differences between the burn wound and healthy skin (&#x00394;T) were measure and compared before and after the excision.</p><p id="Par613">
<bold>Results</bold>
</p><p id="Par614">We performed clinical and thermography assessment in 3 patients, 2 male and 1 female patient, with age range 25-48 years old, and with burn size 7.5% - 41% TBSA. Two patients showed low temperature (temperature of burn area: 34.2&#x000b0;C, &#x00394;T: -2.2&#x000b0;C) on the area of the burn wound so we decided to excised it. After the surgery it shows that the &#x00394;T narrower (temperature of burn area: 32.7&#x000b0;C, &#x00394;T: -0.5&#x000b0;C), that indicated the improvement of the circulation. One patient showed an area of burns with an average temperature (temperature of burn area: 36.9&#x000b0;C, &#x00394;T: 2.2&#x000b0;C). We decided not to excise and appear epithelialization on the 7th day post burn.</p><p id="Par615">
<bold>Conclusions</bold>
</p><p id="Par616">Thermography assessment such as Flir One&#x000ae; thermal imager can be utilized to determine the depth of burns in addition to clinical assessment. It benefits not only for the functional purpose, but also affordable price and practically used. In the future it may be useful to help both experienced surgeons and novices.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec346"><title>Abstract Topic: Others</title><sec id="Sec347"><title>S71 Establishment and effects of a method for wound repair in patients with extensive deep burns using fresh skin allografts and autologous micrograft</title><sec id="Sec348"><title>Chuanan Shen</title><sec id="Sec349"><title>Department of Burns and Plastic Surgery, The Fourth Medical Center of Chinese People&#x02019;s Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China</title><p id="Par617">
<bold>Background</bold>
</p><p id="Par618">Skin allografting is an effective way to cover the wound in extensive burns. However, cadaveric skin has been scarce in recent years in China. This study tried to establish a method for wound repair in patients with extensive deep burns using fresh allogeneic scalp and autologous micrograft.</p><p id="Par619">
<bold>Materials and Methods</bold>
</p><p id="Par620">Two patients with burn injuries involving 90% (3rd degree, 70%) and 97% (3rd degree, 85%) total body surface area (TBSA) respectively were treated with fresh scalp allografts donated by 32 males aged (31.5 &#x000b1; 8.2) years or autologous micrografting. The bilateral extremities with third-degree burns were selected as treatment and control groups. Wounds in the treatment group were treated with fresh allogeneic scalp and autologous micrograft, while wounds in the control group received MEEK grafting. Preoperatively, the surgical area on the extremities was calculated to estimate the necessary amount of allogeneic scalp and MEEK grafts. Fresh scalps (0.30 - 0.35 mm) were harvested from each donor to prepare a larger piece of skin allograft. Autologous micrografts were transported onto the epidermis of the skin allograft. The treatment and control group received grafting according to our protocol. The donors received follow-up visits after 3 months to see if there is alopecia and scar hypertrophy. The wound coverage rate was observed in both treatment and control groups on postoperative weeks 2, 3, 4 and 5.</p><p id="Par621">
<bold>Results</bold>
</p><p id="Par622">The donor sites in all allogeneic skin donors healed within 10 days postoperatively. The scalp recovered well without any alopecia or scar hypertrophy during the follow-up visits. The wound coverage rate of the treatment group was approximate to or higher than that of the control group.</p><p id="Par623">
<bold>Conclusions</bold>
</p><p id="Par624">Since allogeneic skin is scarce and expensive and the patient&#x02019;s relatives are willing to help save the patient&#x02019;s life by donating the scalp, this method may be a feasible option in clinical practice.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec350"><title>Abstract Topic: Paediatric/Electrical &#x00026; Chemical Burns</title><sec id="Sec351"><title>S72 Acticoat Dressings In The Management Of Partial Thickness Paediatric Burns : Our Experience</title><sec id="Sec352"><title>Vaibhav Bhisikar, Seema Rekha Devi</title><sec id="Sec353"><title>Plastic surgery department, Gauhati Medical College &#x00026; Hospital, Guwahati, Assam, India</title><sec id="Sec354"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Vaibhav Bhisikar</title><p id="Par625">

<bold>Background</bold>
</p><p id="Par692">It is difficult to treat pediatric extensive burns, which contribute to high mortality rates, partly because of the lack of large allogeneic skin to close wound in China. Therefore, we innovatively used fresh scalp as thin split thickness skin allografts to cover the burn wounds of pediatric patients.</p><p id="Par693">
<bold>Materials and Methods</bold>
</p><p id="Par694">Fresh scalp allografts were harvested from voluntary donors who were patients&#x02019; relatives. The median total burn area in the major burns was 40% TBSA, ranging from deep-second to third-degree injuries. The fresh scalp allografts were transplanted on the wounds post tangential excision or escharectomy in the way of mere fresh scalp allografts coverage or mixed coverage with autografts and fresh scalp allografts.</p><p id="Par695">
<bold>Results</bold>
</p><p id="Par696">All the patients survived without serious complications during the treatment period.

</p><p id="Par702">Burn patients with body surface area injured &#x0003e; 20% and imipenem indication were recruited. Two set of plasma samples (30 min post-dose and 1-2 hours before next dose) were obtained at imipenem initiation and before the end of imipenem use. ARC was defined if 8h-urinary creatinine clearance (8hClcr) was above 130 mL.min-1173 m2. PK samples were quantified by validated HPLC method.

In the Hep5/Hep10 study, Hep10 group showed significantly shorter mechanical ventilation compared to Hep5 group. In the two Hep5 studies that reported incidence of unplanned intubation, there was no significance compared to control. Two out of 6 studies that looked into pneumonia incidence reported significance compared to control. There were 5 studies that reported bleeding complications, of which three Hep5, one Hep10 and one Hep5/Hep10 studies.

</p><p id="Par767">The need for reconstructive surgery is normally raised by physicians, allied health professionals or patients themselves in response to problems that limit progress of rehabilitation. In the shared decision making process, (1) problems are identified and treatment options are proposed; (2) options are prioritized and selected; (3) final decision is made by the patient. Physicians tend to look at problems from a &#x0201c;disease&#x0201d; perspective, with clear treatment options for abnormalities of structures and functions that are backed by scientific evidence and clinical reasoning, while patients tend to look at problems from an &#x0201c;illness&#x0201d; perspective, with the subjective response of being unwell and its impact on daily life guiding their preferences as opposed to medical knowledge. Despite these different perspectives, physicians and patients share the values of emphasizing the functional purpose of surgery over the cosmetic purpose, as well as setting functional independence and return to society and work as the ultimate goal of surgery.

</p><p id="Par780">Burn scar contracture of fingers always combine the webbing. To correct this problem, surgeons do the scar release and the full-thickness skin graft. Someone do the V-M plasty at the web and graft to the finger sides, and someone do whole graft at the web. Graft to the web is a complicated work, so surgeons often exhausted, also hematoma develop frequently than fingers. So V-M plus side graft seems attractive, but in most cases,, the whole web graft is more effective to release the contracture.

<bold>Background</bold>
</p><p id="Par812">Split-thickness skin grafting is the current gold standard for the treatment of traumatic skin loss. However, for patients with extensive burns, split-thickness skin grafting is limited by donor skin availability. Grafting split-thickness skin minced into micrografts increases the expansion ratio but may reduce wound repair quality. Dermal substitutes such as Pelnac can enhance the healing of full-thickness skin wounds, but their application currently requires two surgeries. The present study investigated whether it is possible to repair full-thickness skin defects and improve wound healing quality in a single surgery using Pelnac as an overlay of minced split-thickness skin grafts in a rat model.</p><p id="Par813">
<bold>Materials and Methods</bold>
</p><p id="Par814">A full-thickness skin defect model was established using Male Sprague Dawley rats (10 weeks old). The animals were randomly divided into control and experimental groups in which Vaseline gauze and Pelnac, respectively, were overlaid on minced split-thickness skin grafts to repair the defects. Wound healing rate and quality were compared between the two groups.</p><p id="Par815">
<bold>Results</bold>
</p><p id="Par816">We found that using Pelnac as an overlay for minced split-thickness skin grafts accelerated wound closure and stimulated cell proliferation and tissue angiogenesis. In addition, this approach enhanced collagen synthesis and increased the formation of basement membrane and dermis as well as the expression of growth factors related to wound healing while reducing scar formation.</p><p id="Par817">
<bold>Conclusions</bold>
</p><p id="Par818">Using minced split-thickness skin grafts overlaid with Pelnac enables the reconstruction of full-thickness skin defects in a single step and can increase the rate while improving the quality of wound healing.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec461"><title>Abstract Topic: Reconstruction</title><sec id="Sec462"><title>S95 Anterior Neck Contracture Reconstruction Using Supercharged Skin Pedicled Flaps</title><sec id="Sec463"><title>Eimi Kodama, Yoshihiro Noda, Mio Tsuchiya, Rei Ogawa</title><sec id="Sec464"><title>Department of Plastic, Reconstructive&#x000a0;and Aesthetic Surgery,&#x000a0;Nippon Medical School Hospital, Tokyo,&#x000a0;Japan</title><sec id="Sec465"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Eimi Kodama</title><p id="Par819">
<bold>Background</bold>
</p><p id="Par820">Reconstruction of the anterior neck requires attention to both aesthetic and functional outcomes. In general, skin grafts are not suitable for anterior neck reconstruction in Asian patients, even when artificial dermis is used prior to skin grafting. Employing various types of thin flaps, we found that skin pedicle must be sufficiently wide to achieve full release of neck contractures leading to neck extension. Here we describe two cases who presented with deteriorating neck contracture after extensive burns, treated by wide, thin, and long flaps harvested from the anterior chest wall.</p><p id="Par821">
<bold>Materials and Methods</bold>
</p><p id="Par822">The first patient was a 71-year-old man who sustained extensive burn injuries from a gas explosion 2 years before visiting our clinic. The second patient was a 19-year-old man who sustained extensive flamed burn injuries from a suicide attempt. Both cases underwent initial treatment including a split thickness skin graft (STSG) for their anterior neck. Before surgery, we confirmed the existence of internal mammary artery perforators (IMAPs) using Multi-Detector Computed Tomography (MDCT). The neck contractures were reconstructed by IMAP supercharged skin pedicled transposition flaps harvested from their anterior chest walls. IMAPs were anastomosed with facial arteries and veins. The contractures were released almost completely. Six months after surgery, the aesthetic results were also good.</p><p id="Par823">
<bold>Conclusions</bold>
</p><p id="Par824">Many methods for reconstructing neck contractures have been chosen: free flaps, local flaps, and free skin grafts. Along with obtaining good aesthetic outcomes, reconstruction of anterior neck scar contractions should also aim for full neck extension . In the present cases, we ensured almost complete release of the scar contracture and normalization of neck movement. Another advantage of relatively wide IMAP-based perforator-supercharged transposition flaps from the anterior chest is their high extendability which further alleviates tension on the flap edges. This reduces the risk of contracture recurrence and development of hypertrophic scars.</p><p id="Par825">Informed consent to publish has been obtained from this patient.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec466"><title>Abstract Topic: Scars Management and Pain Control</title><sec id="Sec467"><title>S96 The changes of immunoreactivity of mechanosensitive molecules upon pressure therapy</title><sec id="Sec468"><title>Yuting Zhang<sup>1</sup>, Cecilia Li<sup>2</sup></title><sec id="Sec469"><title><sup>1</sup>Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China; <sup>2</sup>Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong SAR, China</title><sec id="Sec470"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Yuting Zhang</title><p id="Par826">

Wilcoxon signed rank test and paired sample t test was used to compare VSS scores and scar thickness before and after pressure therapy. One-way repeated measure MANOVA was used to examined the influence of time on the change of the immunoreactivity of mechanosensitive molecules.

</p><p id="Par843">As one kind of pathological healing result from skin trauma, keloid becomes a difficult task to dermatology, plastic surgery and even all of the medicine. Its etiology remains unclear. And none of treatment to keloid is consistently effective. Recent studies have found that the local renin-angiotensin system (RAS) could play an important role in many fibrosis diseases. Based on the above studies and our previous investigative results, this project attempted to explore the mechanism of RAS influencing the signal conduction pathway of ERK and JNK in keloid fibroblast cells, and elucidate the mechanism that AngII may promote synthesizing ECM and secreting fibrosis factors of keloid fibroblast cells.</p><p id="Par844">

<bold>Background</bold>
</p><p id="Par869">Liquid nitrogen freezing treatment applies low temperature on the lesion to make necrosis and shedding for treatment, causing less bleeding and pain. Therefore, liquid nitrogen cryotherapy is widely used in cryosurgery. This study is to study the temperature field characteristics of frozen skin tissue stabbed by cryosurgery probe.</p><p id="Par870">
<bold>Materials and Methods</bold>
</p><p id="Par871">A three-dimensional model of skin is built based on the Pennes Bio-heat Equation. The model takes blood perfusion rate, metabolic heat generation values, the phase change of skin tissue etc. into account. The simulation of temperature field was performed with the finite element analysis software ANSYS, and the feasibility of the simulation method was verified by animal experiments.</p><p id="Par872">

<bold>Background</bold>
</p><p id="Par893">In 2017, a multi-disciplinary team from Singapore General Hospital commenced a long-term project (funded by SingHealth and Temasek Foundation International) to enhance the Dhaka (Bangladesh) healthcare team&#x02019;s capacity in burns management. Prevention of contractures is one of the core tenets in burns rehabilitation, as burn contractures can lead to substantial deformities with devastating dysfunction. However, during the project period, it was observed that burn patients were not maintained in the optimal anti-contracture positioning. The objective of this project is to reduce the risk of contractures with the limited resources available.</p><p id="Par894">
<bold>Materials and Methods</bold>
</p><p id="Par895">A poster that illustrates various anti-contracture positioning was conceptualised. It used strong visuals and clear, succinct text in Bengali to convey the message, taking into consideration the wide variance in literacy level of the target audience. The posters were placed across burn wards in the Dhaka Medical College Hospital. Data was collected on the number of joints correctly positioned in nine patients before and after the posters were displayed. Seven caregivers and nine healthcare staff were interviewed to assess the level of their awareness of the poster and the usefulness of its content.</p><p id="Par896">
<bold>Results</bold>
</p><p id="Par897">Out of 34 joint positions observed, 3 were noted to have improved.

<bold>Conclusions</bold>
</p><p id="Par899">The poster has kick started initial changes to prevent contractures in burn patients. In the next phase of the project, we will focus on training the healthcare staff to use the posters to explain to caregivers. Strategies will also be taught to caregivers on how to position a patient with pain.

<bold>Background</bold>
</p><p id="Par901">Literature suggests that burn contractures are preventable yet, at the same time, studies report a prevalence of 38% - 54%. Is this conflicting evidence as a result of a lack of consensus about the definition of a &#x02018;contracture&#x02019; or how prevalence is calculated? Can we report with any certainty that contractures are, indeed, preventable if we haven&#x02019;t yet fully understood risk factors associated with their development? This study aimed to investigate the current understanding of a burn contracture and how experts in the area use the term.</p><p id="Par902">
<bold>Materials and Methods</bold>
</p><p id="Par903">A comprehensive literature review and expert interviews (n=15) were conducted: experts were required to have more than 10 years clinical experience in the field.</p><p id="Par904">
<bold>Results</bold>
</p><p id="Par905">The majority of the literature is based on research and commentary from high-income countries. Whilst technical definitions of a burn contracture exist, there is limited evidence of a consensus or a standardized, operational definition of a contraction, how it should be measured, why a contracture should be measured or, indeed, when. Furthermore, classification of contracture severity varies. The experts stated that their working definitions of &#x02018;contractures&#x02019; was based primarily on their own clinical experience, rather than the literature. Given the majority of literature in this area consists of clinical reports and opinion, this is understandable. Neither sources focused on detailed, operational definitions, which makes it difficult to build an evidence base for prevention or treatment based on standardized measurement protocols. Despite the lack of this operational definition, clinicians were confident of their ability to identify and measure a contraction.</p><p id="Par906">
<bold>Conclusions</bold>
</p><p id="Par907">Without a valid and reliable definition and measure of contracture, it is challenging to measure prevalence of burn contracture and explore risk and protective factors in burn contracture formation. Can and should the burn care community settle the question of what a contracture is and how to measure one?</p></sec></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec515"><title>Abstract Topic: Tissue Banking</title><sec id="Sec516"><title>106 A review of skin banking guidelines and standards worldwide: Towards the harmonisation of guidelines for skin banking in therapeutic applications for the regions under the Asia-Pacific Burns Association (APBA)</title><sec id="Sec517"><title>Wee Ling Heng <sup>1</sup>, Alvin Wen Choong Chua<sup>1,2</sup>, and Si Jack Chong<sup>3</sup></title><sec id="Sec518"><title><sup>1</sup>Transplant Tissue Centre, Singapore Health Services, Singapore; <sup>2</sup>Department of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore; <sup>3</sup>Asia Pacific Burn Association, Bali, Indonesia</title><sec id="Sec519"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Alvin Wen Choong Chua</title><p id="Par908">
<bold>Background</bold>
</p><p id="Par909">Currently, there is no harmonised standard to govern skin banking in the Asia-Pacific region. Therefore, skin banks are either unregulated, or rely on their nations&#x02019; legislation or international accreditation to uphold their banks&#x02019; quality standards.</p><p id="Par910">
<bold>Materials and Methods</bold>
</p><p id="Par911">A new set of prescriptive skin banking guidelines was developed through a comprehensive review and collation of best practices for Asia-Pacific Burns Association members, from donor screening and testing, to skin recovery, processing, storage and distribution, and quality assurance. National regulatory requirements reviewed include the European Directives, India&#x02019;s Transplantation of Human Organs Act, Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), Japanese Society of Tissue Transplantation and Singapore&#x02019;s guidelines for tissue banking. These legislations are modified from international standards, which offer further technical and quality recommendations. These include the American Association of Tissue Banks (AATB), United States Food and Drug Administration Current Good Tissue Practice (CGTP), the European Good Tissue Practices (EuroGTP) Guide, and Asia-Pacific Association of Surgical Tissue Banking (APASTB).</p><p id="Par912">
<bold>Results</bold>
</p><p id="Par913">Adapted mainly from the AATB standards, these guidelines offer a comprehensive manual, addressing: governance and contracts; staff responsibilities; quality management; facilities, equipment and supplies management; donor consent and testing; recommendations of good practices pertaining to skin recovery, processing, storage and distribution. Besides complementing current generic regulations, they provide specifications of major aspects unaddressed in most legislations: (1)diseases and infections contraindicated for donation; (2)accreditation of testing laboratories; (3)archiving of donors&#x02019; serums; (4)corrective-and-preventive-actions (CAPA) investigations of not only post-operative adverse outcomes, but also errors and accidents; (5)recall procedure; (6)environmental monitoring of skin-processing facilities; (7)process validations prior to implementation of critical processes and revalidations.</p><p id="Par914">
<bold>Conclusions</bold>
</p><p id="Par915">A harmonised standard provides similar quality allografts among member states. It also eliminates the need to maintain exorbitant international accreditation and mandatory compliance to guidelines incompatible to our Asian context. This can also simplify the importation process when an exchange of allografts between transnational jurisdictions is required.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec520"><title>Abstract Topic: Tissue Banking</title><sec id="Sec521"><title>S107 Knowledge and views of nurses on tissue donation</title><sec id="Sec522"><title>Qi Wei Bibi Wang<sup>1</sup>, Wen Ning Ho<sup>1</sup>, Yik Cheong Khoo<sup>1</sup>, Alvin Wen Choong Chua<sup>2</sup></title><sec id="Sec523"><title><sup>1</sup>Transplant Tissue Centre, SingHealth, Singapore; <sup>2</sup>Skin Bank Unit, Singapore General Hospital</title><sec id="Sec524"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Qi Wei Bibi Wang</title><p id="Par916">
<bold>Background</bold>
</p><p id="Par917">Of the Singapore population, only 3% pledged for donation, resulting in a shortage of tissues, such as heart valves, skin and vessels, available for transplantation.</p><p id="Par918">As tissue donations are executed in hospitals and hospices, Transplant Coordinators work closely with nurses to facilitate the process.

<bold>Materials and Methods</bold>
</p><p id="Par921">A survey was conducted from 2014 to 2017 with 1293 nurses working in two tertiary hospitals in Singapore before they attended an one-hour tissue donation awareness talk.

<bold>Results</bold>
</p><p id="Par923">Of the 1293 nurses surveyed, 59.7% of them were in favor of tissue donation although only 32.4% of the nurses had heard of the tissue donation legislation in Singapore. 874 nurses stated that they are uncomfortable approaching the deceased&#x02019;s family for tissue donation; 76% of them felt that doing so would add distress to the family, p &#x0003c; 0.05, while only 5.6% (n = 49) felt that tissue donation is not part of their nursing responsibility, p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p><p id="Par924">
<bold>Conclusions</bold>
</p><p id="Par925">The analysis reflects that more than half of the nurses surveyed were supportive of tissue donation but education seems to be severely lacking. Therefore, healthcare professionals including nurses need to be enriched on donation education catered to their needs (e.g. changing their perception and family approach). This might empower them to play a proactive role in tissue donation in hopes of increasing the tissue donation rates in Singapore.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec525"><title>Abstract Topic: Tissue Banking</title><sec id="Sec526"><title>S108 The Refinement of Decontamination Regimen of Skin Allografts in Singapore General Hospital</title><sec id="Sec527"><title>Zubaidah Binte Dadlani<sup>1</sup>, Si Xuan Tan <sup>2</sup>, Tze Peng Lim <sup>2</sup>, Jialin Yick <sup>1</sup>, Wing Yue Chan<sup>1</sup>, Alvin Wen Choong Chua<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec528"><title><sup>1</sup> Skin Bank Unit, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore; <sup>2</sup> Department of Pharmacy, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore</title><sec id="Sec529"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Zubaidah Binte Dadlani</title><p id="Par926">

</p><p id="Par927">The Skin Bank Unit (SBU) in SGH decontaminates donated skin by incubation in Dulbecco&#x02019;s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing Vancomycin and Amikacin (V+A). While effective against bacteria, this solution lacks an antifungal; thus, any fungal contaminated skin is unsuitable for transplant. In efforts to reduce tissue discard, SBU has tested Amphotericin B (AMB) &#x02013; a cytotoxic but cost-effective antifungal with low Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) and high susceptibility rates across a wide range of fungi &#x02013; against keratinocytes and fibroblasts, finding that the highest tolerable concentration of the drug against skin is 1.0&#x003bc;g/ml.

</p><p id="Par959">Dermal regeneration templates (DRTs), such as Integra&#x000ae; introduced as a new alternative to our surgical arsenal and applied in various types of wound cases, have gained great importance. They have been widely used in reconstructive surgery around the world. Here, we decribe the approving results of full-thickness skin defects reconstruction with DRTs.</p><p id="Par960">
<bold>Materials and Methods</bold>
</p><p id="Par961">The data of patients with full-thickness skin defects who were treated with DRTs, was collected from Fujian Burn Institute in China. Wound bed preparation (debridement or negtive pressure wound therapy) were received previous to DRTs, and second-stage split thickness skin graft (STSG) were performed two weeks after DRTs transplatation. Wound healing rate, clinical and photographic evaluations, and complications related to their use were analyzed.</p><p id="Par962">

<bold>Background</bold>
</p><p id="Par975">Dermal substitutes play an important role in dermis reconstruction /regeneration. However, there is still the problem of insufficient vascularization. The process of angiogenesis is precisely regulated by various cytokines/growth factors. The introduction of pro-angiogenic factors into dermal scaffolds in gene form to positively regulate the vascularization process is a hot spot in vascularization research. VEGF is one of the main regulators of neovascularization. VEGF can specifically combine with VEGFR-2 receptor on the surface of endothelial cells to promote the migration, proliferation and primary lumen formation of endothelial cells.</p><p id="Par976">
<bold>Materials and Methods</bold>
</p><p id="Par977">A cationic gene delivery vector, N,N,N-trimethyl chitosan chloride (TMC), was used to form complexes with the plasmid DNA encoding VEGF. Then, the TMC/pDNA&#x02013;VEGF was incorporated into the dermal scaffold to construct VEGF gene activated dermal scaffold. Next, the scaffold was physically characterized. Subsequently, TMC/pDNA&#x02013;EGFP, naked pDNA&#x02013;VEGF and blank PLGAm/CCS were loaded respectively as controls. The effect of VEGF gene-activated PLGAm/CCS dermal scaffold on cell proliferation was investigated by vaccinating HUVEC in vitro.</p><p id="Par978">
<bold>Results</bold>
</p><p id="Par979">We have successfully prepared VEGF gene-activated PLGAm/CCS dermal scaffold. The scaffolds have a good pore structure and a certain sustained release capacity. The sustained release of TMC/pDNA&#x02013;VEGF has an ideal cell transfection efficiency. HUVECs transfected with TMC/pDNA-VEGF can maintain good proliferative activity and secrete VEGF protein.</p><p id="Par980">
<bold>Conclusions</bold>
</p><p id="Par981">The results show that the VEGF gene activated PLGAm/CCS dermal scaffold is expected to become a new functional tissue engineering skin for promoting vascularization.

</p><p id="Par997">The composition of the dressings with different molecular weight collagen and chitosan solution and their mixed solution can promote the proliferation of HUVECs, and promote the secretion of cell growth factors in vitro. The chitosan solution and collagen chitosan mixture can inhibit the secretion of inflammatory cytokines from HUVECs. When the concentration of nano-silver was 2.5 mg/L or less, it did not affect the proliferation of HUVECs and the secretion of cell growth factors and inflammatory factors. Nano-silver can be stably combined with collagen chitosan which releases lower, and it has good water absorption.

<bold>Background</bold>
</p><p id="Par1050">Allogenic keratinocyte application is known as an effective method for treating 1<sup>st</sup> to 2<sup>nd</sup> degree burns. However, there is only little literature reporting the application of allogenic keratinocyte on 3<sup>rd</sup> degree burns. For some 3<sup>rd</sup> degree burns where definitive surgical reconstruction is precluded due to medical comorbidity of the patient, we investigated the possibility of allogenic keratinocyte as a treatment modality to deep burns that might allow us to avoid high-risk anesthesia and surgery.</p><p id="Par1051">
<bold>Materials and Methods</bold>
</p><p id="Par1052">A 85 year old female patient visited our burn center due to a contact burn on her left hand. A 10 x 15 cm sized deep 2<sup>nd</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> degree burn wound was noted on the dorsoradial aspect of the left-hand dorsum. Considering the surface area and wound depth, surgery was indicated but her medical condition and age exhibited a very high risk for a lengthy operation. Therefore, a chemical escharectomy, serial bedside debridement, and allogenic keratinocyte (Kaloderm&#x000ae;, Tegoscience, Seoul, Korea) was applied.</p><p id="Par1053">
<bold>Results</bold>
</p><p id="Par1054">Chemical escharolysis was undertaken with silver sulfadiazine. Mechanical eschar debridement was performed serially as well. After complete wound bed preparation, Kaloderm&#x000ae; was applied to the wound bed. Kaloderm was changed every three days, considering the engraftment period of keratinocytes to the wound bed. The wound was completely epithelialized after four rounds of Kaloderm&#x000ae; application.</p><p id="Par1055">
<bold>Conclusions</bold>
</p><p id="Par1056">In most cases, treatment of burn wound using allogenic keratinocyte is limited to deep 2<sup>nd</sup> degree burns. Surgical intervention is widely accepted as the mainstay of treatment for 3<sup>rd</sup> degree burns. However, for circumstances where sharp debridement and definitive reconstruction is impossible due to patient&#x02019;s medical condition, serial debridement and escharolysis followed by allogenic keratinocyte therapy can be a safe and reliable option for 3<sup>rd</sup> degree burns.</p><p id="Par1057">Informed consent to publish has been obtained from this patient.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec604"><title>Abstract Topic: Others</title><sec id="Sec605"><title>S124 Prevention Oriented Burns Epidemiology: The First Hospital Based Study from Bangladesh</title><sec id="Sec606"><title>Tanveer Ahmed<sup>1</sup>, Md.

<bold>Background</bold>
</p><p id="Par1059">Bangladesh is a developing country with a 180 million people where the burn incidence is increasing very sharp due to rapid urbanization. The aim of the study was to determine the epidemiology of burns leading to hospitalization in a resource-poor country like Bangladesh with a focus on the pre-event phase of injury.</p><p id="Par1060">
<bold>Materials and Methods</bold>
</p><p id="Par1061">In 2017, total 6913 victims were hospitalized from 52100 who appeared in the emergency and OPD of the only Burn &#x00026; Plastic Surgery Institute and all of them were enrolled in a descriptive study. A simple data sheet was created to supply with every admitted patient focusing on to obtain burn injury related information necessary for prevention purposes.</p><p id="Par1062">
<bold>Results</bold>
</p><p id="Par1063">Males constituted 56% of victims, mean age was 22 years. The most severe burns occurred between the ages of 18 and 32 years mainly flame related (47%). However, scalds representing 45% of burns cases. Irrespective of types, women suffered more severe burns &#x00026; mortality than men and the severe cases in children were under the age of 5 years. More than 80% of burns occurred at home where the kitchen was the main place of injury in 47% of cases, followed by living rooms in 28%. The main container was the rice cooking pot in 37%, followed by water kettles in 32% cases. The difference between a flame and non-flame burns in the distribution of burns in extremities was not statistically significant, but head and neck burns were 3.7 times more likely to be caused by flame.</p><p id="Par1064">

<bold>Background</bold>
</p><p id="Par1087">Due to insufficient rehabilitation manpower in Bangladesh, the nursing community in Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) Burn Unit and Sheikh Hasina National Institute of Burn and Plastic Surgery (SHNIBPS) tend to provide only limited basic rehabilitation for their patients. Within this context of an environment lacking professional rehabilitation therapists, an aide memoire would be helpful to guide nurses to provide appropriate and effective rehabilitation for post-burn patients.</p><p id="Par1088">
<bold>Materials and Methods</bold>
</p><p id="Par1089">A rehabilitation aide memoire was developed by the SingHealth rehabilitation team and implemented as a standard text for rehabilitation in the DMCH Burn Unit and SHNIBPS in Bangladesh in 2019. To review the usefulness of the aide memoire in improving the knowledge and confidence level of nurses involved in the rehabilitative care of burns patients, nurses who attended the SingHealth Temasek Foundation International Capacity Enhancement for Burn Specialists Training Programme in April 2019 were surveyed before and after reading the rehabilitation aide memoire.</p><p id="Par1090">
<bold>Results</bold>
</p><p id="Par1091">A total of 45 nurses were surveyed. 20% of the nurses had &#x02264;1 year of experience in managing burns patients, 64% had &#x0003e;1 to 3 years of experience, 5% had &#x0003e;3 to 5 years of experience and 11% had &#x0003e;5 years of experience.

<bold>Background</bold>
</p><p id="Par1119">Infection is the foremost cause of morbidity and mortality in Dhaka National Institute of Burns and Plastic Surgery, Bangladesh. With the construction of a new institute, a key initiative is to develop their first infection control unit. As infection control requires conscious effort and practice, understanding the knowledge and perception of healthcare professionals is crucial</p><p id="Par1120">
<bold>Materials and Methods</bold>
</p><p id="Par1121">This is a descriptive, cross-sectional study investigating the knowledge and perception regarding infection prevention and control among doctors and nurses. A self-administered questionnaire was drawn from research and WHO Perception Survey for Healthcare Workers. It consisted of closed, Likert scale and open-ended questions on knowledge, perception, obstacles and possible solutions.</p><p id="Par1122">
<bold>Results</bold>
</p><p id="Par1123">While all participants (n=33) agreed that infection control reduces mortality, 28.6% of doctors (n=7) reported that hand hygiene (HH) was not the best measure for infection control. 73.1% of nurses (n=26) and only 28.6% doctors reported that HH required a lot of effort. However, 53.8% nurses reported being able to perform HH during recommended situations, while doctors (100%) reported not being able to do so. Nonetheless, nurses (73.1%) and doctors (57.1%) reported that fulfilling tasks was more important than HH when busy. Nurses (100%) reported that it was important for management and fellow healthcare professionals that they perform optimal HH. Two- fifths of doctors reported that it was not important. Out of products, product not in convenient locations were top responses for not practicing HH. Supportive management, education, clear and simple instructions, feedback or audits and hand rubs made available at all point of care were reported as effective measures.</p><p id="Par1124">

Mercury exposure in humans can have serious health consequences, including permanent damage to the developing nervous system in children.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/events/2017/make-mercury-history/en/">www.who.int/mediacentre/events/2017/make-mercury-history/en/</ext-link>

Although cholera had not been reported in Sierra Leone as of 11 September, recent landslides and floods have disrupted the infrastructure and substantially increased the risk of a cholera outbreak.</p><p>A preventive vaccination campaign, with two rounds of oral cholera vaccine was planned by the Government of Sierra Leone, with support from the Gavi Alliance, WHO, UNICEF and other partners. The first vaccination round was due to take place in September and the second round, early this month.</p><p>A decision to release cholera vaccine from the global stockpile for the preventive campaign was taken on 31 August, by the International Coordinating Group for Vaccine Provision, following a WHO assessment of the situation. Just over one million doses of the vaccine were delivered to Freetown on 7 September by UNICEF.</p><p>WHO recommends that vaccination against cholera should be considered in emergencies and other situations, where there is a high risk of disease outbreaks and when vaccination can be combined with standard prevention and control measures for the disease.</p><p>These measures include readiness to provide testing and treatment, steps to ensure access to safe water and sanitation, and community mobilization to engage the public in efforts to prevent infection.</p><p>Since the global stockpile of cholera vaccine was established in 2013, more than 14 million doses have been released for deployment in 17 countries.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2017/sierra-leone-cholera-vaccination">www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2017/sierra-leone-cholera-vaccination</ext-link>

It provides data on 10 indicators in all of WHO&#x02019;s 194 Member States, based on the results of a recent survey.</p><p>NCDs represent the largest cause of death globally and kill 17 million people before the age of 70 annually. Many NCD deaths can be prevented by reducing tobacco use, unhealthy diets, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol.</p><p>The findings of the <italic>Noncommunicable diseases progress monitor 2017</italic> will underpin a report that WHO is due to submit to the UN Secretary General Ant&#x000f3;nio Guterres later this year, ahead of the third UN High-level Meeting on NCDs in 2018.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/nmh/">www.who.int/nmh/</ext-link>

In 2017, an estimated 7.2 million adult Ukrainians smoke daily (35.9% of adult men and 7.0% of adult women) as compared with 10.5 million adults who smoked daily in 2010 (45.4% of adult men and 8.9% of adult women).</p><p>The proportion of the population exposed to second-hand smoke at home, at work and in public, and of those exposed to tobacco promotion through marketing of tobacco products, have both decreased. Tobacco product prices have increased significantly, partly because of tax increases, and the public is more aware of the harms of tobacco, the survey found.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/disease-prevention/tobacco/data-and-statistics">www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/disease-prevention/tobacco/data-and-statistics</ext-link>

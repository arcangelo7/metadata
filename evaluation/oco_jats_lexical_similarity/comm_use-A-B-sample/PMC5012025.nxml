HSs usually characterize excessive proliferation of fibroblasts, abnormal deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) during wound healing, associated with cosmetic, functional, and psychological problems. Owing to the role of ECM proteins in scar formation, we comparatively analyzed matrix proteins secreted by normal skin fibroblasts (NSFs) and HS fibroblasts (HSFs). The acetone-extracted secreted proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and identified by mass spectrometry (MS). Based on Go annotation of MS data, the profiling of ECM proteins was established and scar-related proteins have been screened out. The functions of several ECM proteins identified by MS have been discussed, such as collagens I, VI, XII, fibronectin, decorin, lumican, and protein procollagen C endopeptidase enhancer 1 (PCPE-1). Among them, the MS result of PCPE-1 was supported by Western blotting that PCPE-1 from HSFs were significantly upregulated than that from NSFs. It is suggested that PCPE-1 could be a potential target for scar treatment. The exploration of scar related proteins may provide new perspectives on understanding the mechanism of scar formation and open a new way to scar treatment and prevention.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Key words</title><kwd>Extracellular matrix protein</kwd><kwd>fibroblast</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>hypertrophic scar</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>In general, a wound repair process occurs in almost all tissues after the exposure to any destructive stimulus and is one of the most complex biological processes.

Precursor ions had a minimum signal to noise value of 25 with charges up to a maximum of 5. The <sup>12</sup>C peak was determined by data extractor.

Cysteine carboxymethylation and methionine oxidation was used as a fixed modification and a variable modification, respectively. Two missed cleavages were allowed. The Spectrum Mill autovalidation was performed first in the protein details mode and then in the peptide mode. Minimum scores, minimum scored peak intensity, forward minus reversed score threshold, and rank 1 minus rank 2 score threshold for peptides were dependent on the assigned precursor charge. To eliminate redundancy, the protein summary mode groups of all proteins that have at least one common peptide, and only the highest scoring member of each protein group is shown and counted in the protein list.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Gene ontology (GO) annotation</title><p>Go annotation was performed on secreted proteins.

ECM proteins play pivotal biological regulatory roles and are the most important sources for protein therapeutics. Therefore, the analysis of ECM proteins secreted by NSFs and HSFs may provide new perspectives on HS formation and treatment. ECM contains many adhesive proteins, including fibronectin, collagen, and laminin, which generally promote cell attachment or migration.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] Collagens stand for a large family of ECM proteins. Collagen fibril networks are stabilized by their interaction with proteoglycans and/or other collagenous and noncollagenous proteins. The synthesis ability of collagen in HSFs is obviously enhanced than that in NSFs, resulting in the excess synthesis and deposition of collagen. Excessive collagen deposition is related not only to increased collagen synthesis, but also to reduced collagen degradation. Compared pathological scars with NSs, the activity of fibroblast collagenase was significantly reduced, while the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels of collagenase decreased significantly.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]</p><p>It is shown from Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> that the tendency of pI distribution of identified ECM proteins from NSFs and HSFs is in agreement with reported research.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] This means that the identification of ECM proteins from fibroblasts is efficient. We identified major known ECM components, collage I and VI, laminin, fibronectin, decorin, and lumican [Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>], though some proteins were not detected by LC-chip-MS/MS, for example, elastin, collagen III and IV, and other proteoglycans. Some known proteins were not detected could be those reasons: The protein amount is not large enough to be identified with our instrument; some proteins are glycosylated or cross-linked, and could not be efficiently digested. For example, the formation of intermolecular covalent bonds among elastin molecules will prevent the digestion and solubilization of elastin. Additionally, more proteins would be detected if a more sensitive high quality mass spectrometer available. However, based on GO annotation, these matrix proteins are still involved 12 biological processes and eight activities.</p><p>Herein, collagens I, VI, XII and fibronectin were identified in both cell culture supernatants. Collagen VI is a non-fibrillar collagen. In collagen VI null mice, dysfunctional regulation of tendon fibrillogenesis was indirectly mediated by collagen VI.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] Collagen XII has been classified as a fibril-associated collagen with interrupted triple helices (FACTs) and is bound to the surface of collagen I fibrils,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] a fibril-forming protein. Collagen XII is a novel candidate marker of myofibroblasts, and/or cancer cells undergoing dedifferentiation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] Cancer-associated fibroblasts present a myofibroblastic phenotype, similar to the one obtained by resident fibroblasts during wound healing. Collagen XII can interact with various other ECM proteins like decorin and tenascin-X via distinct or overlapping domains.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]</p><p>Fibronectin is a large ECM glycoprotein with a MW of 440 kDa and exists as a protein dimer. Fibronectin not only binds to membrane-spanning receptor proteins called integrins, but also binds with ECM protein such as collagen, fibrin, and syndecans.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] Fibronectin regulates dermal fibroblast cell behavior during wound repair. The fragmentation of fibronectin by proteases has been suggested to promote wound contraction, a critical step in wound healing. Fibronectin helped the deposition of collagen in the wounded site and was observed to be closely associated with the newly deposited collagen fibrils. An <italic>in vitro</italic> study with native collagen has demonstrated that fibronectin bound to collagen III.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] Fibronectin also regulated latent TGF-&#x003b2;1 by controlling matrix assembly of latent TGF-&#x003b2;1-binding protein-1.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]</p><p>A large number of noncollagenous ECM proteins have been implicated in regulating collagen fibrillogenesis, including small leucine-rich repeat proteoglycans (SLRPs) like decorin and lumican. Lumican and decorin was founded in NSF and HSF culture supernatants, respectively. Decorin was found in HSFs consistent with the view that decorin at the messenger RNA and protein level was significantly higher in the skin lesions of patients with nephrogenic systemic fibrosis than healthy subjects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] Decorin is a natural anticancer agent and reduced level of decorin was associated with more aggressive disease, such as tumorigenesis, tumor invasion, and/or tumor growth.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] Interestingly, lumican plays a restrictive role on prostate cancer progression, and it is postulated that lumican could be a valuable marker in prostate cancer staging.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] Interestingly, HSFs exhibit excessive proliferation, apoptosis resistance, and atypical differentiation, which are the characteristics of malignant tumors. This maybe explained why some scar-related proteins also affect cancer progression. Because of the limitation of the used mass spectrometer and the differentiation from sample preparation, the proteins observed in HSFs or NSFs can only stand for more proteins appeared in MS, and is a primary proteomic profiling of scar-related proteins and further quantitative proteomic analysis need to be carried out.</p><p>Here, we elaborated a potential role of protein procollagen C endopeptidase enhancer 1 (PCPE-1) in HS formation. PCPE-1, a 55-kDa ECM glycoprotein without intrinsic proteolytic activity, containing two N-terminal CUB (complement-Uegf-BMP1) domains and a C-terminal NTR (netrin-like) domain, was found to be one of proteins related to fibrosis,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] but no mass-based studies have reported on the relationship between PCPE-1 and skin fibrosis so far. The CUB domains of PCPE-1 can bind specifically to type I procollagen C propeptides leading to potential fibrosis, while the NTR domains of PCPE-1 may inhibit matrix-degrading proteinases.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] PCPE-1 can enhance the activity of procollagen C proteinases (PCPs) significantly. The activity of PCPs is necessary for the conversion of soluble procollagen into the complete formation of collagen fibrils.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] PCPs can cleave the C propeptides of procollagen I to III and the N-propeptides of procollagen V, which can cause fibrosis, and this is an important step for assembling the major fibrous components of vertebrate ECM.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] During scar formation, TGF-&#x003b2; was highly expressed in HSFs, whereas, TGF-&#x003b2; can increase the PCP expression. In the process of scar formation, the higher expression of PCPE can cause the increase of procollagen into collagen fibrils; Secondly, the markable increase of PCPE-1 in HSF culture supernatants would reduce the production of matrix-degrading proteinases. All together, the increase of PCPE-1 promoted scar formation. Our MS results of PCPE-1 was supported by Western blotting [Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>] and that the amount of PCPE-1 from HSFs was much more than that from NSFs, whereas, the function of PCPE-1 in scar formation still needs further study. No matter what mechanism PCPE-1 has, it plays a vital role in scar formation. Thus, to control the production of PCPE-1 may provide new insights into scar treatment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We established the profiling of extracellular proteins from NSFs and HSFs. A total of 36 and 34 ECM proteins were identified from NSF and HSF culture supernatants, respectively. By comparing ECM proteins from both cells, scar-related proteins were screened out, the function of several major ECM proteins were discussed in detail. PCPE-1 was found to be related to scar formation, and might be a new target for scar treatment. Some scare related ECM proteins could open new perspectives for understanding the mechanism of scar formation and provide new methods for scar treatment.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>

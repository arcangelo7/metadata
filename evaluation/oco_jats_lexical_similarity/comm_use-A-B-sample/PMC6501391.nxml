In this report, the use of leukocyte- and platelet-rich fibrin (L-PRF) is emphasized for complex wounds as an alternative, simple, inexpensive, time-saving process that does not require hospitalization and has a healing potential over that of bare soft tissue, including bone, tendon, and ligaments. The aim of this study is to extend the use of L-PRF in small-to-moderate-sized complex wounds of lower extremities in which L-PRF maintains the sensitive structures viable.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Between January 2016 and December 2017, 17 small-to-moderate-sized complex wounds of lower extremities treated with L-PRF were recruited from the plastic and reconstructive surgery clinic in Aydin State Hospital, Turkey. The treatment was administered twice per week in the outpatient clinic. Depending on the size and extension of the complex wound, two to five blood samples were collected into 8.5&#x000a0;ml dry, glass vacuum tubes with no anticoagulant, and samples were immediately centrifuged at 1630&#x000d7;<italic>g</italic> for 5&#x02009;min to obtain L-PRF.

All wounds showed significant improvements after L-PRF therapy and full closure after a median of 18&#x02009;months, with an interquartile range of 11 to 34&#x02009;months of L-PRF applications.

In developed countries, it is estimated that 1 to 2% of the population will experience a chronic wound during their lifetime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. According to a new report, the global market for advanced wound care products will reach US$ 16.0 billion by 2022 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The most common encountered chronic wounds are ulcers of the lower extremities, which usually last, on average, 12 to 13&#x02009;months and therefore remain a major workload problem for clinicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Moreover, the biggest repercussions of such wounds are the decrease in quality of life and productivity of patients. In working patients, leg ulcerations are correlated with loss of time from work, loss of jobs, and adverse effects on finances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Chronic wounds are classically defined as wounds that have failed to proceed through an orderly and timely reparative process to produce anatomic and functional integrity over a period of 3&#x02009;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Although this definition has frequently been used, the term &#x0201c;chronic wound&#x0201d; only means that more time is needed to heal the wound. Hence, it could be argued that this term is not a good for characterizing the complexity of the problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Consequently, it would be better to use the term &#x0201c;complex wounds&#x0201d; rather than &#x0201c;chronic wounds&#x0201d; to describe well-known, difficult wounds that challenge medical and nursing teams regardless of whether they are acute or chronic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Management of complex wounds has undergone major developments over the past decade, and the interest in the field of wound care has led to advancements of the use of tissue engineering and biological products. Recently, platelet-based products have gained significance and are currently some of the most commonly used biological products for wound healing. Although the use of platelet derivatives for the treatment of skin wounds has a five-decade history with various names [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], the first-known accepted description of the regenerative use of platelets was provided by Marx in 1998 as platelet-rich plasma (PRP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. PRP was described as an autologous source of growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor, and the obtained growth factor-beta was transformed by sequestering and concentrating platelets via gradient density centrifugation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. After the working definition was provided by Marx et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], platelet-based bioactive treatments gained in popularity in many areas, including dentistry, oral and maxillofacial surgery, dermatology, and cosmetic surgery. Described as an easily obtained, fast, effective, relatively cheap, and safe product, PRP has been the subject of increased clinical interest in the market [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Despite its widespread use, one of its reported drawbacks is the use of anticoagulation factors, which may cause a delay in normal wound-healing processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Additionally, ready-to-use commercially available disposable PRP preparations and separation kits could cost US$ 175&#x02013;1150 per kit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Therefore, the high costs and the need for specialized equipment to prepare PRP could critically reduce the use of autologous platelets in clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Akhundov et al. commented that more simplified methods that do not require ad hoc and costly equipment would help to accumulate clinical data and introduce the method in a routine manner in clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Therefore, it was necessary to develop manual methods for the preparation of low-cost PRP or to create different biological methods. Given these limitations, manual PRP techniques have evolved, and studies focused on developing a second-generation platelet concentrate. Consequently, a platelet concentrate lacking coagulation factors, which was later termed platelet-rich fibrin (PRF), was developed based on its anticipated properties in tissue regeneration and wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">An autologous, solid, fibrin biomaterial was first introduced in 2000s. Leukocyte- and platelet-rich fibrin (L-PRF) has a very specific three-dimensional architecture (thick and dense polymerized fibrin strands), cell content, and distribution (97% of the platelets and &#x0003e;&#x02009;50% of the leukocytes from the initial blood harvest) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The growth factor content of L-PRF was logically expected to be much higher that of PRP as most platelets are activated in L-PRF clots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. An intact PRF membrane slowly releases 273.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;15.3&#x02009;ng transforming growth factor-&#x000df;1 (TGF-&#x000df;1), 6071&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;773&#x02009;pg vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and 50.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.3&#x02009;ng platelet-derived growth factor-AB (PDGF-AB) over 7&#x02009;days, which represent large amounts of these growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">In recent years, the interest in biological products, primarily in autologous platelet-rich preparations, has increased. The rationale of this study is related to the use of L-PRF concentrations, which is a relatively recent development that differs from other preparations given its potential for healing and neoangiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In addition, the unique three-dimensional structure of L-PRF contains a known capacity of platelets, leukocytes, and growth factors that persist in the application site, providing superior prolonged action compared with other preparations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In this report, the use of L-PRF on complex leg wounds is and presented as an alternative, simple, and low-cost method. The technique is fast and does not require hospitalization, leading to less time lost from work and good healing potential given that granulation tissue forms on bare bones, tendons, and ligaments in small-to-medium-sized wounds. The aim of this study is to extend the use of L-PRF in small-to-moderate-sized complex wounds, in which L-PRF maintains the sensitive structures viable and protects them from necrosis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and patient selection</title><p id="Par17">A retrospective review was performed to evaluate the therapeutic effects of L-PRF on patients with complex wounds. Between January 2016 and December 2017, 17 small-to-moderate-sized complex wounds of lower extremities treated with L-PRF were recruited from plastic and reconstructive surgery clinic in Aydin State Hospital, Turkey. This institution is a station hospital where patients are sent from the surrounding counties, and the plastic surgery department is the only department that treats complex wounds. All the protocols used in this study were conducted according to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki and international regulations as reflected in the approval of the study by the Ethics Committee of Ankara Training and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey (0040/0408). Notably, informed consent was obtained from each patient. All cases reported in this study were treated in the outpatient clinic without the need for hospitalization or an operating room. Patients&#x02019; age and gender and the initial wound size, wound type, comorbidities, wound etiology, injured soft tissue structures, number of treatments, and duration of wound were identified and reviewed from their medical records.</p><p id="Par18">The L-PRF treatment was applied twice per week until the wound was completely epithelialized. No extra specialized wound care was performed. Additionally, a topical antibiotic ointment (5&#x02009;mg/g neomycin, 500&#x02009;IU/g bacitracin) was occasionally applied as a prophylactic treatment when dressings were performed exclusively in the presence of an erythematous appearance around the wound. The primary endpoint was healing on consecutive days. Complete healing was defined as the day of complete wound epithelialization. Wound information was either collected by the medical personnel assessing the wounds or obtained from photographs of the wounds. In our clinical practice, wound measurements are made of the greatest length and width, and those measurements are multiplied to obtain the area of the initial wound size.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p id="Par19">The following inclusion criteria were used in this study: (a) patients over 18&#x02009;years of age; (b) patients with well-known, difficult wounds that challenge medical and nursing teams regardless of whether they are acute or chronic; (c) patients with a chronic wound in need of another treatment that has not been healed by specialized wound care; (d) patients without any extra specialized wound care material other than L-PRF applications; and (e) patients with a minimum follow-up period of 6&#x02009;months. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (a) patients with anemia or thrombocytopenia, (b) patients with suboptimal wound care before first admission, (c) patients with necrotic wounds because it was believed that platelets would be unable to penetrate the wound bed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and (d) patients with a disease and/or medication affecting platelet function and structure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>L-PRF preparation and application</title><p id="Par20">Two to five blood samples (depending on the size and extension of the defect to be filled) were collected in 8.5&#x000a0;ml dry, glass vacuum tubes with no anticoagulant and were immediately centrifuged at 1630&#x000d7;<italic>g</italic> for 5&#x02009;min (see Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;1: Video S1). To prevent initiation of coagulation cascades before centrifugation and to allow natural transformation of the fibrin matrix during centrifugation, this step was performed as soon as blood was collected in the tubes. After centrifugation, three layers were observed. The basal layer consisted of red blood cells (most dense), the top layer consisted of non-cellular plasma (least dense), and the middle layer consisted of the L-PRF coagulate (medium density). Using sterile forceps, L-PRF was removed from the tube and stripped from the adjacent red blood cell layer (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). With absorption of L-PRF serum into a gauze pad, a membrane rich in fibrin from the matrix that exhibited high resistance was obtained. During each visit, after mild irrigation and mild debridement of the wound, L-PRF treatment was applied and the wound was covered with a few thick pieces of gauze. All the procedures, including opening the wound, irrigation, debridement, preparation and application of L-PRF, and re-dressing, took approximately 10 to 15&#x02009;min, on average.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Leukocyte- and platelet-rich fibrin&#x000a0;is observed in the middle layer and is stripped from the adjacent red blood layer with a sterile forceps before application</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41038_2019_149_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par21">

After hospitalization and intravenous antibiotic therapy in the infectious disease unit, 80% of the total dorsal area of the foot was affected by necrosis. The patient underwent surgical debridement and transposition flap surgeries with skin grafting of the donor sites. Due to distal flap necrosis, the bare tendons of the foot were exposed after sharp debridement (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). We performed L-PRF treatment twice per week (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). During each visit, the bare tendons were viable and white in color, unlike those in other commercial dressing materials (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c&#x02013;e). A completely healed foot was obtained without any observed complications (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>f).

An interesting case of a non-healed wound secondary to trauma in a 65-year-old-male who had an advanced peripheral arterial disease with diabetic dermopathy was also observed, and the wound was successfully healed after 8&#x02009;L-PRF applications (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a&#x02013;d). An example of an acute complex wound sample was a healthy young male who sustained a right tibial fracture from a motorbike injury, requiring surgical open reduction and internal fixation by a plate and screws. Additionally, he underwent consecutive flap surgeries, including a hemisoleus muscle flap with skin grafting and a transpositional fasciocutaneous flap due to recurrent distal necrosis of the flaps (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). After unsuccessful surgeries, the patient did not prefer to undergo another surgery. L-PRF treatment was subsequently applied to the patient.

Approximately 6&#x02009;months later, the defect was uneventfully closed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par27">Bioactive substances and their effects are hotly debated in the field of regenerative medicine. The main area of research seems to focus on the biology of platelets and leukocytes in wound-healing processes. Unfortunately, many studies mainly focus on growth factors. The fibrin architecture and the leukocyte content of these products are also often neglected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The presence of leukocytes has a strong impact on the biology of these products not only given their immune and antibacterial properties but also their major key roles in the wound-healing process and local factor regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">The beneficial effect of L-PRF membranes in the healing of complex leg wounds can be explained by their high concentration of platelets and leukocytes together with the long-term release of growth factors specific to the L-PRF matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The presence of a fibrin matrix enhances the delivery of growth factors over the wound area. Unlike PRP, L-PRF does not dissolve quickly; it dissolves over hours after application. Hence, L-PRF sustains a very significant slow release of key growth factors for days, which means that PRF stimulates its environment for a significant amount of time during the wound-healing process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. We hypothesize that the slow release of key growth factors during the first week may explain the positive results of PRF that we observed in our patients: &#x0201c;maintaining the viability of bare and vulnerable tissues such as tendon, bone, and/or ligaments.&#x0201d; In an <italic>in vitro</italic> study that included endothelial cell cultures and chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane assays, PRF preparations were somewhat more potent in angiogenesis than PRP preparations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Leukocytes are among the main motivators of bone and soft tissue regeneration and contribute to the release of the angiogenic and lymphogenic factors responsible for cellular crosstalk in the tissue regeneration process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Accordingly, without leukocytes, sophisticated cell&#x02013;cell communication for tissue regeneration is not possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The increased presence of these cells potentially influences the differentiation of macrophages, which are key cells derived from the myeloid lineage and are implicated in growth factor secretion during wound healing, including TGF-beta, PDGF, and VEGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">On the other hand, fibroblasts are the most influential cells in the production of collagen and other extracellular matrix components. Fibroblasts within chronic wounds have been shown to arrest the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. For the initiation of wound-healing processes, it is important to induce the activation of the arrested cell cycles of fibroblasts within chronic wounds. Fibroblast proliferation is precisely regulated by cell cycle regulatory proteins, which are composed of two protein classes, cyclins and their kinase partners cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks). Fibroblasts are strongly reactive to growth factors, including fibroblast growth factor-beta, epidermal growth factor, and PDGF. Notably, the expression of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinase proteins increases in response to a high concentration of platelet-based suspensions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. These suspensions induced the upregulation of type I collagen as well as increased cell migration, proliferation rates, and expression of G1 cell cycle regulatory proteins, such as cyclin A, Cdk2, and cyclin E, in human skin fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">The main controversy regarding L-PRF involves whether the presence of leukocytes has a beneficial or detrimental effect. Leukocytes produce catabolic cytokines that may impair tissue healing. On the other hand, some authors believe that leukocytes provide antimicrobial effects and natural protection against allergic responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Although L-PRP and L-PRF are rich in leukocytes, increased total amounts of IL-1&#x003b2; were observed in blood clots with L-PRF and L-PRP due to the partial loss of leukocytes during L-PRP and L-PRF preparations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The interleukin (IL)-1&#x003b2; concentration was previously found to be positively correlated with neutrophils and monocytes in L-PRP concentrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. One study reported that more than half of leukocytes were trapped in PRF membranes; small lymphocytes were mainly collected but were not correlated with inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">Leukocytes are also involved in the communication between precursor cells and mesenchymal cells with regard to bone formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The strongest induction of mesenchymal stem cell migration was observed in response to L-PRF, which may suggest the complexity of growth factors and cell interactions in cellular processes during tissue healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. It should be noted that a pure growth factor or cytokine could have an inconsistent effect compared with the cocktail of factors present in wound healing. Ultimately, it can be hypothesized that L-PRF may provide a continuous and prolonged growth factor and cytokine system that involves a cascade of complex, orderly, and elaborate events with an acceptable environment for tissue injuries.</p><sec id="Sec11"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par32">An acknowledged limitation of this study is the lack of a control group for L-PRF applications. A prospective study including patients undergoing L-PRF treatment compared with either another treatment or saline could be possible. However, it could be argued that comparing a treatment modality with a no treatment response control group would be unwise and unethical. Notably, L-PRF applications were performed in all of our patients with non-healed complex wounds despite their current wound care. On the other hand, while L-PRF may be considered helpful in wound healing and furthermore may essentially bypass some of the limitations of commercial single-growth factors, it is not the &#x0201c;holy grail&#x0201d; of wound healing. Other limitations of this study include the small sample size of the study and the single-center nature of the study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par33">In our study, we used L-PRF to treat complex wounds in lower extremities. Tendon, and/or bone exposure commonly occurs in wounds of lower extremities. In addition, it could be challenging to form healthy granulation tissue by simple dressings in such exposed tissues while maintaining the viability of vulnerable tissues. For such wounds, an advanced therapy is recommended in the literature for those who do not respond to standard treatments within 4&#x02009;weeks. Additionally, if a patient has any additional morbidities or problems, which can make surgery impossible and difficult, the clinician should seek alternative options other than surgery in small-to-medium-sized complex wounds. Due to the idealistic concept of <italic>primum non nocere</italic>, the clinician may experience a contradiction between doing no harm and doing better. Therefore, in these circumstances, L-PRF could represent a good alternative for small-to-medium-sized complex wounds because it can be prepared in a user-friendly manner with autologous, inexpensive, effective, and protective dressing materials and does not require any hospitalization. In conclusion, our results contribute to the growing evidence regarding the treatment modality of L-PRF. L-PRF protects and maintains the exposed tissues viable to facilitate the formation of granulation tissue, increase epithelization, and reduce the need for additional soft tissue surgery in small-to-medium-sized complex wounds.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>Cdks</term><def><p id="Par5">Cyclin-dependent kinases</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>L-PRF</term><def><p id="Par6">Leukocyte- and platelet-rich fibrin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PDGF-AB</term><def><p id="Par7">Platelet-derived growth factor-AB</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PRP</term><def><p id="Par8">Platelet-rich plasma</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TGF-&#x000df;1</term><def><p id="Par10">Transforming growth factor-&#x000df;1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VEGF</term><def><p id="Par11">Vascular endothelial growth factor</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge our nurse Emel Yetkin for her help with patient follow-up.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par34">The authors confirm that they received no funding or support for this work and had no financial interests to declare.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par35">The datasets used and/or analyzed in the current study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>KO performed the follow up of the patients.

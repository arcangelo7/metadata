Childhood pneumonia is challenging to diagnose. Currently, in low-resource settings (LRS), pneumonia is diagnosed using WHO Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) guidelines that rely on assessing variable and subjective clinical signs like respiratory rate and chest indrawing.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Given the limitations of these non-specific clinical signs, it is not fully understood how effective WHO IMCI guidelines are in identifying pneumonia.</p><p>Diagnostic alternatives to WHO IMCI have challenges as well.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Clinical diagnosis not using WHO IMCI guidelines lacks standardisation and can lead to empiric antibiotic administration. Chest radiography (CXR) can be costly, difficult to obtain and time consuming and exposes the child to ionising radiation.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> Microbiology (eg, blood culture, lung/pleural aspiration and/or bronchoalveolar lavage) can be slow, is invasive and only detects a limited proportion of cases.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Biomarkers such as C reactive protein can correlate with bacterial infection but have no set threshold and do not indicate a specific aetiology.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</p><p>Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a promising pneumonia diagnostic technology that has demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> There is compelling evidence that indicates that LUS may have greater sensitivity, similar specificity and better interoperator reliability when compared with CXR, a diagnostic not readily available in LRS.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;10</xref> Additional advantages of LUS, relative to CXR, include its portability, ease of use, lower cost and absence of ionising radiation.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 11</xref> The goal of this pilot is to generate evidence to build a greater consensus regarding the use of LUS as a tool for the diagnosis of childhood pneumonia in LRS.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study design and setting</title><p>The primary objectives of this prospective, observational, facility-based cohort study are: (1) to provide scientific evidence assessing whether the addition of LUS to the current pneumonia pathways improves identification of pneumonia in children 2 through 23 months of age presenting to district hospitals in Manhi&#x000e7;a, Mozambique and Karachi, Pakistan and (2) to determine whether LUS is feasible, usable and acceptable among healthcare providers (HCPs) and caregivers of children with respiratory symptoms for diagnosing and managing pneumonia in these settings.

examinations are performed by trained non-physician healthcare personnel who received a 3-day standardised training course as well as 2 days of supervised practice prior to the initiation of study activities. During the LUS examination, longitudinal and oblique scans are obtained of the anterior, lateral and posterior sides of the child&#x02019;s chest. Six areas are examined on each enrolled child, comprising the anterior, lateral and posterior areas of the lungs, further divided into the upper and lower halves. Study personnel begins by conducting a longitudinal scan in each of the aforementioned areas. If any abnormality (eg, consolidation) is identified, an oblique scan is performed. The child is examined in his/her most comfortable position (eg, the caregiver&#x02019;s arms).</p><p>To ensure quality and consistency of LUS collection and interpretation, on-site LUS training is performed prior to study initiation, video refresher trainings are performed as necessary during the study, and a LUS standard operating procedures (SOP) document provides an a priori description of features typical to pneumonia diagnosis. A standardised LUS reporting form includes all chest areas examined as well as the patterns detected (ie, interstitial syndrome, consolidation, air bronchogram and pleural effusion; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP2">online supplementary appendix 2</xref>).<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The LUS interpretation targets the detection of typical subpleural lung consolidations with tissue-like or anechoic patterns and blurred, irregular margins. LUS is considered positive when consolidation and/or pleural showing features described in the LUS SOP is present on imaging. At least two independent physicians trained in LUS interpret each examination. If discordant, a designated LUS interpretation expert acts as a tiebreaker. In addition to the aforementioned interpretation, the LUS operators at each site also interpret each examination in order to facilitate comparison between interpretations by physicians with extensive LUS training and those done by newly trained study personnel. To minimise bias, on-site LUS interpretation is performed after the fact (rather than in real-time) in batches, including examinations from at least four children. Results from the study LUS examinations do not inform or impact the child&#x02019;s clinical care.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SP2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjresp-2018-000340.supp2</object-id><label>Supplementary data</label><p>

For controls, a finger stick or blood sample for haemoglobin, malaria (Mozambique only), HIV screening (Mozambique only) is collected. Respiratory samples are collected from all cases. Nasopharyngeal swabs (Pakistan) or aspirates (Mozambique) are collected for respiratory viral and bacterial PCR using a commercial multiplex test. In Mozambique, nasopharyngeal swabs are also collected to evaluate carriage of bacterial pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Qualitative substudy</title><p>A mixed methods evaluation is conducted to assess the feasibility, usability and acceptability of LUS for diagnosing childhood pneumonia in a LRS. Semistructured IDIs are conducted among HCPs and administrators associated with the study. Direct observation and IDIs are conducted among caregivers of children enrolled in the overall study. During the IDIs, trained qualitative study staff introduce each question separately. If study staff do not get a satisfactory response (eg, the respondent does not understand the question, the respondent does not provide information that answers the question, the response lacks detail and so on), study staff repeat the question and probe for additional information, but do not prompt any responses. The IDIs are conducted in the language best understood by the caregiver (ie, Portuguese or Changana in Mozambique; Urdu or Sindhi in Pakistan). During the direct observation, study staff record how much time was spent explaining the LUS examination to the caregiver as well as any questions, comments or reactions by the caregiver.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Sample size</title><p>The total sample size for this study is 270 children (100 cases and 20 controls at the Mozambique site; 130 cases and 20 controls at the Pakistan site). This is a pilot study seeking to demonstrate feasibility of investigating LUS for pneumonia diagnosis and prognosis in a district facility setting. Its underlying purpose is to generate evidence to inform future full-scale studies. Thus, the sample size may not provide adequate power to answer all of the research questions laid out in this protocol. The sample size was selected to maximise the amount of information collected within the confines of the available resources. With the proposed 230 case participants, if an estimated 30%&#x02013;40% of enrolled children with chest indrawing is found to have pneumonia by CXR, we would have a sample of 70&#x02013;90 case participants with radiologically confirmed pneumonia. We believe that this is sufficient to generate evidence and inform future studies regarding the use of LUS as a tool for pneumonia diagnosis and prognosis.</p><p>For the feasibility, usability and acceptability assessment, the total sample size is approximately 20 participants in each cohort (10 HCPs/administrators and 10 caregivers at each site). All study HCPs are invited to participate in the data collection procedures for this portion of the project; healthcare administrators may also be invited to participate.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Data collection and quality assurance</title><p>Quantitative study data are collected by clinical study staff using designated source documents or paper-based case report forms which are then entered into a REDCap electronic database or via direct data entry into REDCap.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Qualitative study data are collected using paper-based forms and audio recordings which are subsequently transcribed for analysis.</p><p>Clinical research data are maintained through a combination of secure electronic data management system and physical files with restricted access to ensure confidentiality. Two distinct study databases are maintained separately by each study site: the primary study database with study visit data and a database with participating children&#x02019;s personally identifiable information. To ensure accuracy and completeness, data are routinely reviewed by the sponsor through quality assurance reviews, audits and evaluation of the study safety and progress. Standard GCP is followed to ensure accurate, reliable and consistent data collection.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Data management</title><p>Primary data management activities, which include data entry and validation, data cleaning, database quality control and disaster recovery plans are undertaken at each study site and are overseen by the on-site data manager.

In order to minimise the risk of coercion, hospital staff inform caregivers about the study and refer only those who are interested. During the informed consent process, study staff emphasise that the child will receive the required medical care whether enrolled in the study or not. Other potential risks to study participation may include those associated with collection of respiratory and blood specimens, CXR and LUS examinations and delayed medical management. In order to minimise the discomfort and risks associated with respiratory and blood specimen collection, study staff collecting specimens from children are trained in the appropriate procedures and supervised accordingly. Whenever possible, research blood draws are combined with clinical blood draws to minimise the amount of needle sticks experienced by the child. Study staff implementing CXR are trained in appropriate procedures and supervised accordingly with standard precautions in place to protect children from ionising radiation. To minimise the dose of ionising radiation, only one CXR is obtained during the study period; there are no repeat CXR assessments unless clinically indicated. Study staff implementing LUS examinations are trained in appropriate procedures and supervised accordingly with standard precautions in place. In order to minimise the possibility that participation in this study interferes with the medical management of hospitalised children, study staff are trained in integrating research procedures with clinical care. Urgent clinical care for acute medical issues is always prioritised above research procedures. Extreme care is taken to ensure that no necessary treatment is delayed to accommodate study procedures.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Dissemination</title><p>We plan to disseminate study results in peer-reviewed journals and international conferences, targeting those involved in the clinical care of children in LRS as well as those who develop and advise on policies and guidelines in those settings. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (registration number NCT03187067).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Efforts towards generalisable results</title><p>The study was carefully developed and pragmatically designed with inclusion and exclusion criteria to allow for the most generalisable results possible without putting children with danger signs or severe respiratory distress at risk. Children with comorbidities such as malnutrition, anaemia, HIV and malaria are included in order to enrol a broad group of children. Enrolled cases have been diagnosed with chest indrawing pneumonia based on WHO IMCI clinical guidance, as is common in LRS where children are typically diagnosed based on clinical criteria alone.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Efforts towards rigorous protocol</title><p>Dedicated study staff trained in GCP, IMCI and study-specific procedures follow children enrolled in the trial to assure the protocol and SOPs are followed and data are accurately collected. Standardised training, supervision and oversight are undertaken to ensure quality, consistency and harmonised trial procedures and implementation. Regular monitoring is provided by Save the Children to assess compliance with human subjects and other research regulations and guidelines, adherence to the study protocol and procedures and quality and accuracy of data collected.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Limitations and bias</title><p>Limitations to this study and potential sources of bias include the sampling strategy, harmonising the data between study sites, loss to follow-up and LUS and/or CXR interpretation bias. As noted above, given that the study is a pilot, the sample size may not provide adequate power to answer all of the proposed research questions. Because the study sites and the populations the hospital facilities serve are so different from each other, and the sample sizes of the enrolled children are relatively small at each study site, it may be difficult to harmonise the data between sites or data may simply represent the different underlying pneumonia epidemiologies. To mitigate this risk, we are applying the same enrolment criteria between study sites and are training study staff at both sites according to the same standardised protocols. We are also monitoring study staff performance with multiple quality control procedures and interim trainings. To minimise loss to follow-up, community sensitisation and outreach are performed and caregivers of enrolled children are provided with clear follow-up instructions and reminders prior to the follow-up visits. Home visits take place among children who missed a follow-up visit. To eliminate LUS and/or CXR interpretation bias, trained panels of CXR and LUS experts interpret all images. The panels are blinded to each other&#x02019;s interpretations, and discordant interpretations are adjudicated in a process modelled after the WHO CXR process.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> LUS and CXR interpretations are based on a priori guidance set forth in the LUS and CXR SOPs.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> JLL and ASG designed the study and wrote the protocol.

mainly refer to the function disorders in heart and vascular system, including
hypertension, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, stroke and
congenital heart disease. The ischemic heart disease is a major etiology of
cardiovascular diseases, in which the coronary atherosclerotic heart disease
occupies a large proportion<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. Myocardial infarction is the most common cause of
ischemic heart disease. It is mainly caused by myocardial ischemia due to coronary
circulation disorder. Myocardial infarction is the common cause of death from
cardiovascular diseases<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. In addition, the incidence of arrhythmias caused by
myocardial infarction is very high, with the high mortality rate<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. <italic>Radix
Scutellariae</italic> is the dried root of <italic>Scutellaria baicalensis
Georgi</italic>. It is one of the commonly used Chinese medicinal herbs in the
Asia region and has a long history of clinical application. Baicalin belongs to
flavonoids. It is the main active component of <italic>Radix Scutellariae</italic>
<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. Baicalin has a
wide range of pharmacological effects, which are mainly presented in the
antioxidant, free radical scavenging, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, blocking
calcium channel, inhibiting aldose reductase, antiviral and anti-allergic
aspects<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. In addition, baicalin has
protective effects on the immune, cardiovascular, digestive and nervous
system<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>. This study investigated
the protective effect of baicalin on experimental myocardial infarction in rats and
explored the related mechanisms. The objective was to provide a theoretical basis
for the development of baicalin related medicines for mitigation and treatment of
myocardial infarction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Animal Grouping and Treatment</title><p>Fifty Sprague Dawley (SD) rats (200&#x000b1;20 g; Laboratory Animal Center of
Sichuan University, Chengdu, China) were randomly divided into 5 groups: control
group, model group, and low-, middle- and high-dose baicalin groups, 10 rats in
each group. The rats in low-, middle- and high-dose baicalin groups were
intraperitoneally injected with baicalin [High performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) purity &#x02265; 98%; Shanghai Jingdu Biological Technology
Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China], with a dose of 12.5, 25 and 50 mg/kg,
respectively. The rats in the control and in the model group were
intraperitoneally injected with normal saline. The injection was performed once
per day and was continued for 10 days. On the 8<sup>th</sup> day, the rats in
the model group, low-, middle- and high-dose baicalin groups were subcutaneously
injected with isoprenaline (Shanghai Hefeng Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Shanghai,
China) (20 mg/kg) once per day, for continued 2 days, thus the rat model of
myocardial infarction was established. The rats in the control group were
subcutaneously injected with the equivalent volume of normal saline. Finally,
the electrocardiography was performed, and the value of ST-segment elevation was
used as the index to assess the myocardial ischemia.</p></sec><sec><title>Hemodynamic Test</title><p>At the 12 hours after the second injection of isoprenaline, a polyethylene
plastic pipe with the diameter of 1 mm was inserted into the left ventricle of
rats through the left carotid artery to perform the cardiac catheterization and
was connected with the biological signal acquisition system. The left
ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP) and left ventricular end diastolic pressure
(LVEDP) were measured, which were used to evaluate the hemodynamic of rats.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of Serum Lactate Dehydrogenase, Creatine Kinase-MB,
Prostacyclin and Thromboxane A<sub>2</sub></title><p>Rats were anesthetized using sodium pentobarbital by intraperitoneal injection.
The abdominal cavity was opened. The blood of the abdominal aorta was taken,
followed by centrifugation at 256 X g for 10 min. The serum lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) were detected using the
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The serum prostacyclin
(PGI<sub>2</sub>) and thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> (TXA<sub>2</sub>) levels
were determined using radioimmunoassay. The procedures were in accordance with
the instructions of kits (Sigma-Aldrich Corp., MO, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of Myocardial Superoxide Dismutase and Malondialdehyde</title><p>Heart of rats was taken, immediately followed by rinsing with saline. The 10%
myocardial homogenate was made from 100 mg myocardial tissue using 5 ml of
Tris-HCl solution (pH 7.4). After centrifugation at 626 X g for 10 min, the
supernatant was obtained. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde
(MDA) levels were determined by ELISA. The procedures were in accordance with
the instructions of kits (Sigma-Aldrich Corp., MO, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of Myocardial B-Cell Lymphoma-2 and Bcl-2 Associated X Protein
Expression</title><p>The myocardial tissue of rats was homogenized and the protein was extracted. The
expressions levels of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2 associated X (Bax)
protein were determined using Western blot assays. The procedures were in
accordance with the instructions of kits (Fuzhou Maixin Biotechnology
Development Co., Ltd., Fuzhou, China).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS 22.0 software (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA). The data were presented as mean &#x000b1; SD and were compared
using single-factor analysis of variance test with SNK-q test.

systolic function and increased myocardial oxygen consumption<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>. Results of this study
showed that, after injection of with isoprenaline, the ST segment height and LVEDP
in rats were significantly increased, respectively, and the LVSP was significantly
decreased. This indicates that the myocardial infarction of rats has been
successfully created. Compared with the model group, the ST segment height and LVEDP
in groups with pretreatment using a certain dose of baicalin were significantly
decreased, and the LVSP was significantly increased, respectively. This indicates
that baicalin can improve the cardiac systolic and diastolic function, reduce the
myocardial oxygen consumption, improve ventricular compliance, and mitigate the
myocardial ischemia.</p><p>The activity of plasma LDH and CK-MB indirectly reflect the integrity of myocardial
cell membrane and the degree of myocardial injury<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>. In myocardial cell necrosis, the
integrity of myocardial cell membrane is damaged, with increased permeability, which
results in the leakage of intracellular LDH and CK-MB into plasma, leading to the
increased LDH and CK-MB concentration in blood<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>. Results of this study showed that the
serum LDH and CK-MB levels in model group were significantly increased when compared
with control group, respectively. Compared with the model group, the LDH and CK-MB
levels in middle- and high-dose baicalin group were significantly decreased,
respectively. This indicates that the pretreatment with baicalin can prevent the
leakage of intracellular LDH and CK-MB into plasma, thus exerting the myocardial
protection functions.</p><p>TXA<sub>2</sub> can promote the platelet aggregation and the contraction of the
coronary arteries<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>. On the contrary, PGI<sub>2</sub> is known as the most
potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation, with cytoprotective effect indirectly
expanding coronary artery and inhibiting the production of oxygen free
radicals<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>. In myocardial infarction, the arterial endothelial is
damaged, so the PGI<sub>2</sub> synthesis in coronary artery endothelial cells is
decreased. Therefore, the platelet aggregates in the subendothelial collagen tissue,
and excessively activates the production of a large number of TXA<sub>2</sub>
<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>. In the present
study, compared with the control group, the serum PGI<sub>2</sub> level in rats in
model group was significantly decreased, and the TXA<sub>2</sub> level was
significantly increased. Compared with the model group, the PGI<sub>2</sub> level in
the three baicalin groups was significantly increased, and the TXA<sub>2</sub> level
was significantly decreased. This suggests that baicalin can prevent the decrease of
PGI<sub>2</sub> level and the increase of TXA<sub>2</sub> level in myocardial
infarction rats, which may be related to its myocardial protective effects.</p><p>In isoprenaline-induced myocardial infarction model, the pathogenesis is related to
lipid peroxidation, free radical production, membrane permeability changes and
calcium overload in the myocardium<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>. SOD is an important antioxidant enzyme in the
body. It can catalyze the transformation of oxygen free radicals to hydrogen
peroxide, thus avoiding the damage to cells. MDA is one of the final products of
cell membrane lipid peroxidation. It indirectly reflects the degree of cell membrane
peroxidation<sup>[<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>. Results of this study showed that, compared with the
control group, the myocardial SOD level in the model group was significantly
decreased, and the myocardial MDA level in the model group was significantly
increased. Compared with the model group, the SOD level in the high-dose baicalin
group was significantly increased, and the myocardial MDA level in the middle- and
high-dose baicalin groups was significantly decreased, respectively. This suggests
that baicalin has the ability of scavenging radical and reducing lipid peroxidation,
thus playing a role in myocardial protection in rats.</p><p>Bcl-2 gene is a specific survival gene for inhibiting the apoptosis of cells. It
plays an important role in the regulation of cell apoptosis<sup>[<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>. Bcl-2 can resist various
forms of cell death and prolong the life-span of cells, which leads to the increase
of cells<sup>[<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>. Bax
gene is the apoptosis-promotion gene. Bax gene and Bcl-2 gene belong to the same
gene family. Bax can not only inhibit the apoptosis inhibition effect of Bcl-2, but
also directly promote the apoptosis of cells<sup>[<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup>. In this study, compared with the control
group, the myocardial Bcl-2 protein level in the model group was significantly
decreased, and the myocardial Bax protein level was significantly increased.
Compared with the model group, the Bcl-2 protein level in the high-dose baicalin
group was significantly increased, and the Bax protein level was significantly
decreased (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). This indicates that baicalin can up-regulate
the expression of the Bcl-2 protein and down-regulate the expression of the Bax
protein in rats, thus mitigating the myocardial infarction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Baicalin has protective effects on myocardial infarction in rats. The possible
mechanisms may be related to its resistance of oxidative stress, and up-regulation
of the Bcl-2 protein expression and down-regulation of the Bax protein expression in
myocardial tissue. This study has provided a theoretical basis for the development
of baicalin related medicines for mitigation and treatment of myocardial infarction.
This study still has some limitations. ST segment height, LVEDP and serum LDH in the
baicalin groups still had significant differences with the control group
(<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). The reason may be that the baicalin doses used in
this study are not enough to largely lower above indexes in the myocardial
infarction rats to normal levels. Therefore, other suitable doses of baicalin should
be further investigated. In addition, whether there are other mechanisms in the
protective effects of baicalin on myocardial infarction needs to be further
confirmed.</p><table-wrap id="t3" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="5%" span="1"/><col width="95%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">LW</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Agreement to be accountable for all

<italic>Penicillum janthinellum</italic> SDX7 was isolated from aged petroleum
hydrocarbon-affected soil at the site of Anand, Gujarat, India, and was tested
for different pH, temperature, agitation and concentrations for optimal growth
of the isolate that was capable of degrading upto 95%, 63% and 58% of 1%, 3% and
5% kerosene, respectively, after a period of 16 days, at optimal growth
conditions of pH 6.0, 30 &#x000b0;C and 180 rpm agitation. The GC/MS chromatograms
revealed that the<italic>n</italic>-alkane fractions are easily degraded;
however, the rate might be lower for branched alkanes,
<italic>n</italic>-alkylaromatics, cyclic alkanes and polynuclear aromatics. The
test doses caused a concentration-dependent depletion of carbohydrates of
<italic>P. janthinellum</italic> SDX7 by 3% to 80%, proteins by 4% to 81%
and amino acids by 8% to 95% upto 16 days of treatment. The optimal
concentration of 3% kerosene resulted in the least reduction of the metabolites
of <italic>P. janthinellum</italic> such as carbohydrates, proteins and amino
acids with optimal growth compared to 5% and 1% (v/v) kerosene doses on the
12<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup> day of exposure. Phenols were found to
be mounted by 43% to 66% at lower and higher concentrations during the
experimental period. Fungal isolate <italic>P. janthinellum</italic> SDX7 was
also tested for growth on various xenobiotic compounds.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Penicillum janthinellum</italic> SDX7</kwd><kwd>optimal growth</kwd><kwd>metabolites</kwd><kwd>kerosene degradation</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="1"/><ref-count count="42"/><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Kerosene currently has several uses such as aircraft gas turbine and jet fuel for
both commercial airlines and the military activities, as heating oil, and as a spray
oil to combat insects on agricultural plants. Because of its availability compared
to gasoline during wartime, commercial illuminating kerosene was the fuel chosen for
the early jet engines. Consequently, the development of commercial jet aircraft
following World War II focused primarily on the use of kerosene-type fuels (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Irwin <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). According
to the US Coast Guard Emergency Response Notification System, kerosene is one of the
most commonly spilled petroleum products containing paraffins (alkanes),
cycloparaffins (cycloalkanes), aromatics, and olefins with carbon numbers
betweenC9&#x02013;C20 (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Irwin <italic>et al.</italic>,
1997</xref>). Large amounts of spills and leaks of petroleum products such as
gasoline, diesel, kerosene, and similar compounds have been refined and handled on
land every year. Despite careful handling, there is a possibility of introduction
into the soil environment. The penetration of hydrocarbons from the top of the soil
into the subsoil leads to a direct risk of ground water contamination (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Schinner and Margesin, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Watkinson and Morgan, 1989</xref>). Although a significant
proportion of the compounds in petroleum products are relatively innocuous, a number
of lower molecular weight compounds are toxic or mutagenic and require remedial
action to restrict environmental damage (<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">Greer
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>)</p><p>Microorganisms are powerful alternatives to conventional methods in resolving
environmental problems (<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">Bento <italic>et
al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Bacteria, yeast and filamentous fungi have been
reported as transforming agents due to their ability to degrade a wide range of
pollutants because of their ubiquitous nature. Various bacterial genera that have
been reported to contain hydrocarbon degrading species include <italic>Pseudomonas,
Vibrio, Arthrobacter</italic> and <italic>Bacillus</italic> (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Zajic, 1972</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Snape
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Fungal degradation of defined single
hydrocarbons as well as petroleum products has been performed by
<italic>Penicillium, Candida, Fusarium, Aspergillus, Articulosporium</italic>
(<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Sugiura <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>;
<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Mukherji <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>).
<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Kumar <italic>et al.</italic> (2013)</xref>
performed biodegradation of high molecular weight PAHs such asphenanthrene and
fluoranthene using cyanobacterial species - <italic>Aulosira fertilissima</italic>
ghose. These organisms have been isolated in large numbers from many oil-polluted
waters and soils but are found in lesser numbers in uncontaminated environments
(<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Okoh, 2003</xref>). Biodegradation is
considered to be a major mechanism for the removal of spilled petroleum hydrocarbons
from the environment (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Braddock and Lindstrom,
2002</xref>). Therefore, it is necessary to perform laboratory feasibility tests
to determine the effectiveness of biodegradation of kerosene due to the significant
effect of the inherent capabilities of the microorganisms, by their ability to
overcome the bioavailability limitations in multiphase environmental scenarios and
by environmental factors such as pH, temperature, nutrients and electron acceptor
availability (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Mukherji <italic>et al.</italic>,
2004</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Trindade <italic>et al.</italic>,
2005</xref>). Less is known about the biodegradability of petroleum commercial
products such as kerosene (<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">Gouda <italic>et
al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Shamiyan
<italic>et al.</italic> (2013a</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">b)</xref> investigated the interactions of soil nutrients with Total Petroleum
Hydrocarbons (TPH), with isolation and characterization of different
petroleum-degrading fungal isolates. Moreover, no attempt has been made in the
proposed work to establish the differential effects of various concentrations of
kerosene on biochemical constituents of the fungal isolate <italic>Penicillium
janthinellum</italic> SDX7 in liquid media during the biodegradation process.
Hence, in the present investigation, an attempt has been made to optimize the fungal
isolate at different conditions and its biochemical response during the petroleum
hydrocarbon biodegradation of kerosene.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Fungal Isolate, Media and Culture Conditions</title><p>A fungal strain <italic>P. janthinellum</italic> SDX7 was isolated and screened
from aged petroleum hydrocarbon-infected soil at the site of Anand, Gujarat,

(<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Shamiyan <italic>et al.</italic>,

Agar (PDA) media and for the optimization and degradation studies, Mineral Salt
Medium (MSM) with the addition of various concentrations of kerosene as the sole
carbon source. The liquid medium was sterilized at 121&#x000b0;C for 15 min before
addition of the kerosene (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Zajic and Supplisson,

approximately 105 spores/mLwere grown by adding 15 mL of sterile distilled water
to mature fungal colonies on PDA plates (4&#x02013;5 days) to dislodge the spores from
the mycelium. These suspensions were then used to inoculate 100 mL MSM
containing 3% (w/v) glucose in 500 mL Erlenmeyer flasks (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Kendrick and Ratledge, 1996</xref>). The cultures were
incubated at 30 &#x000b0;C in an incubator shaker operating at 180 rpm for 48 h. The
resultant active growing cultures were aseptically washed three times with 300
mL of sterile distilled water to remove remaining glucose fractions. This
resulting culture was then used as the standard inoculum for further
experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of optimal growth</title><p>The optimization study addresses different pH values, temperature, speed of

growth after 7 days of incubation. MSM medium with kerosene (without

a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 100 mL of MSM with the addition of 3%
(v/v) kerosene and incubated at 30 &#x000b0;C in an orbital shaker at 180 rpm for 7

16 days. The residual petroleum hydrocarbon was recovered by chloroform
extraction at a ratio of 1:1 MSM medium: chloroform (<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">Chaillan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). MSM
without fungal inoculation was used as the control. Analysis of the fungal
biodegradation activity was made using a computerized capillary gas
chromatograph with flame ionization detector (GC/FID, Perkin Elmer-Auto
System, SICART, V.V. Nagar) equipped with HP 3390A Integrator, split
injector (split ratio 20/1) and flame ionization detector set at 300 &#x000b0;C. The
carrier gas was nitrogen at a flow rate of 1.5 mL min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. The
column was polydimethylsiloxane (length 30 m, internal diameter 0.32 mm,
film thickness 0.25 &#x003bc;m). The temperature was programmed to increase from 60
to 320 &#x000b0;C at 4 &#x000b0;C min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. The total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH)
degradation by <italic>P. janthinellum</italic> SDX7 isolate was calculated
according to the following equation:</p><disp-formula id="e01"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>%</mml:mo><mml:mtext>B</mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>100</mml:mn><mml:mi>&#x02009;</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mtext>TPHC</mml:mtext><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mtext>TPHI</mml:mtext><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>TPHC</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula><p>where B is biodegradation, TPHC is the total petroleum hydrocarbon in the

scanning from <italic>m/z</italic> 30 to 650 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and detected
using an auto system XL GC apparatus (Perkin Elmer, SICART, V.V. Nagar). The
column temperature was initially 80 &#x000b0;C, held for 5 min, then ramped from 80
&#x000b0;C- 290 &#x000b0;C at 10 &#x000b0;C min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Helium (1.0 mL min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) was
used as the carrier gas. Both line and injector temperatures were set at 250
&#x000b0;C. Each methanolic extract (1 &#x003bc;L) was injected in the split mode (1:40). MS
conditions were EI + through a Perkin Elmer Turbo mass spectrometer as
follows: ionization energy &#x02212;70 e V, nominal; scan rate, 1.6 scans/s;
inter-scan delay, 0.01 s; source temperature, 250 &#x000b0;C; mass range, 30 to 650
Daltons; solvent delay, 3.00 min. The gas chromatogram as reproduced by the
mass spectrometer identified the mass spectrum scanned at each GC peak
maximum. Data were thus obtained by comparing the mass spectra to those in
the Wiley NIST/EPA/NIH Mass Spectral Library 2005.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of metabolites</title><p>The variation in the metabolites was determined on the 4<sup>th</sup>,
8<sup>th</sup>, 12<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup> days by cultivating
the <italic>P. janthinellum</italic> SDX7 culture under optimal conditions
such as pH 6, temperature of 30 &#x000b0;C, speed of agitation at 180 rpm and
addition of optimal 3% (v/v) with higher 5% and lower 1% (v/v) dose of
kerosene. Total carbohydrate release was determined spectrophotometrically
by the anthrone method using glucose as the standard (<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">Hedge and Hofreitte, 1991</xref>). The protein content
of the crude cell-free extract was estimated (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Lowry <italic>et al.</italic>, 1951</xref>) using bovine
serum albumin as the standard. An improved colorimetric determination of
amino acids by the use of ninhydrin was performed (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Lee and Takahashi, 1966</xref>). Phenol stress
metabolites were estimated using Folin-Ciocalteu reagent (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Malick and Singh, 1980</xref>). Each experiment was
conducted in replicates of three and their &#x000b1; SE values were calculated.
Multivariate analysis was performed using KY plot (2.0 beta) to estimate the
correlation between metabolites.</p></sec><sec><title>Growth of P. janthinellum SDX7 on other xenobiotic compounds</title><p>Fungal isolate <italic>P. janthinellum</italic> SDX7 was also tested for its
growth on various xenobiotic compounds, namely, diesel fuel, gasoline fuel,
toluene, benzene, xylene, naphthalene, pyrene and phenanthrene at a
concentration of 0.1% [(w/v)/ (v/v)] as a sole carbon source in MSM and
incubated under optimized conditions (at 30 &#x000b0;C temperature and shaking
conditions of 180 rpm). The samples were withdrawn after 7 days, and the
biomass was estimated in the form of the dry weight (<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">Gojgic <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>Optimization of growth parameters</title><p>
<italic>P. janthinellum</italic> SDX7 grew better under acidic conditions,
showing optimal growth (0.38 g/L) at pH 6. Previous studies also reported that
several fungal isolates such as <italic>Fusariumsolani</italic>, <italic>F.
oxysporum</italic>, <italic>Trichodermaviride</italic> (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Verdin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>) and
<italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Srivastava and Thakur, 2006</xref>) cultured in acidic MSM medium provided
good growth. Although its growth was highest under acidic conditions, isolate
<italic>P. janthinellum</italic> SDX7 was able to grow sparsely in a
relatively wide range of pH values from 4.0 to 9.0, suggesting that this isolate
could degrade kerosene under not only acidic but also under neutral and alkaline
conditions (<xref rid="f01" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). Among the
parameters that could affect biomass production, temperature was generally
considered to be the most important and limiting factor (<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">Delille, 2004</xref>). The common incubation temperature for
the growth of fungi such as <italic>A. niger</italic>, <italic>Fusarium sp.,
Penicillium sp.</italic> and <italic>Graphium sp</italic>. is taken to be 30
&#x000b0;C (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Santos and Linardi, 2004</xref>). Moreover,
in this study, <italic>P. janthinellum</italic> SDX7 cultured at different
temperatures produced maximum biomass (0.38 g/L) when incubated at 30 &#x000b0;C
compared to 20 &#x000b0;C and 40 &#x000b0;C, temperatures that resulted in the production of a
maximum of 0.31 g/L and 0.33 g/L biomass, respectively (<xref rid="f01" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). This difference may result from a greater
production of enzymes and optimal growth conditions of the isolate for its
kerosene degradation (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Rohilla <italic>et
al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). This range of temperatures makes this
isolate suitable for use in bioremediation in tropical climates. <italic>P.
janthinellum</italic> SDX7 showed an increase of biomass as the rate of
agitation increased up to 180 rpm; biomass production was then reduced when the
speed of agitation accelerated to 230 rpm (<xref rid="f01" ref-type="fig">Figure
1c</xref>). Agitation influenced the tested fungi to absorb more nutrients
by not only increasing the surface area of the microorganism for degradation of
the kerosene oil hydrocarbons (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Lee <italic>et
al.</italic>, 1996</xref>) but also by booming the amount of dissolved
oxygen in the cultivation medium (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Purwanto
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Agitation speed has also been
proven to be a critical factor influencing mycelial biomass (<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">Hamzah <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). <italic>P.
janthinellum</italic> was found to grow in a wide range of kerosene
concentrations. The production of biomass rose to 0.38 g/L in the presence of 3%
(v/v) of kerosene on the 5<sup>th</sup> day. However, the production of biomass
declined when the concentration of kerosene escalated beyond 3% (v/v) (<xref rid="f01" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref>). Notably, minimal growth was
found when the medium contained 10% and 20% kerosene doses.</p><fig id="f01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Optimal biomass production of <italic>P. janthinellum SDX7</italic>
after 7 days of incubation.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="1517-8382-bjm-46-2-397-gf01"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Biodegradation of kerosene</title><p>To determine the ability of <italic>P. janthinellum</italic> SDX7 to degrade
kerosene, the total petroleum hydrocarbons were estimated at the end of the
4<sup>th</sup> and the 16<sup>th</sup> day of treatment at 1%, 3% and 5%
kerosene treatments. Where 1% v/v kerosene showed the highest degradation at 85%
and 95%, followed by 3% kerosene treatment at 32% and 63% degradation and a 5%
kerosene dose by 28% and 58% reduction on 4<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup>
day, respectively (<xref rid="f02" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The
biodegradation of kerosene was confirmed by the reduction in the area under the
hydrocarbon peaks of the chromatograms when compared to that of the abiotic
control (without organism), suggesting that the removal of kerosene hydrocarbon
components ranged from 8 to 18 carbon atoms. In the chromatographic images of
1%, 3% and 5% (v/v) kerosene doses in a liquid medium, the sharp and highest
peak stands for the <italic>n</italic>-alkanes, and the peaks between them
comprise the naphthenes and aromatics. <italic>P. janthinellum</italic> SDX7
showed a reduction in the area under the hydrocarbon peaks corresponding to the
carbon atoms (C8 to C18) when compared to the abiotic control in the case of the
1%, 3% and 5% kerosene, where the lowest concentration of 1% displayed the
highest reduction (<xref rid="f03" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) followed by
3% (<xref rid="f04" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) and 5% (<xref rid="f05" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). The chromatograms showed that the
<italic>n</italic>-alkane fractions are easily degraded by the tested fungal
isolate as the days progress. However, the rate might be lower for branched
alkanes followed by <italic>n</italic>-alkylaromatics, cyclic alkanes and
polynuclear aromatics. The present results are in agreement with the findings
obtained by <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>
(1998)</xref>, who studied the comparison of crude oil composition changes
due to biodegradation and physical weathering using different fungal and
bacterial isolates. Moreover, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Nocentini
<italic>et al.</italic> (2000)</xref> studied the biotreatability and
feasibility of a bioremediation process by a bacterial species for a
kerosene-contaminated soil. The results indicated that the <italic>P.

degrading kerosene hydrocarbons. Our results also agreed very well with the
findings of <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Mancera-L&#x000f3;pez <italic>et

metabolic products such as carbohydrates, amino acids and proteins was affected
at the earlier stage of kerosene applications, a result that is in agreement
with the study of <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Kumar <italic>et al.</italic>
(2013)</xref> who studied the impact of PAH exposure on certain
cyanobacterial species. The level of total carbohydrates decreased after 12 to
16 days in all the concentrations of kerosene-treated isolate. After the
12<sup>th</sup> day of exposure, carbohydrate content ranged from 0.6
mgmL<sup>&#x02212;15</sup> to 2.24 mgmL<sup>&#x02212;15</sup> and was significantly reduced
by 50%, 11% and 76%, whereas a higher level of reduction was encountered after
the 16<sup>th</sup> day by 59%, 24% and 80% at 1%, 3% and 5% kerosene exposures
to <italic>P. janthinellum</italic> SDX7, respectively (<xref rid="f06" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a</xref>). A similar reduction in the carbohydrate
content was recorded by <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Kumar <italic>et
al.</italic> (2008)</xref> in nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria when treated
with endosulfan<italic>.</italic> Protein content fluctuated from 1.44
mgmL<sup>&#x02212;15</sup> to 3.78 mgmL<sup>&#x02212;15</sup> and was inhibited by 46%, 13%
and 67% on the 12<sup>th</sup> day (<xref rid="f06" ref-type="fig">Figure
6b</xref>) and 70%, 48% and 81% after the 16<sup>th</sup> day, significantly
at 1%, 3% and 5%, respectively, of kerosene-treated <italic>P.
janthinellum</italic> SDX7 isolate as shown by <xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">Babu <italic>et al.</italic> (2001)</xref> and <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Laxmi <italic>et al.</italic> (2007)</xref> in
response to lindane and organophosphorus on certain cyanobacterial species. At
the end of the experiment after the 16<sup>th</sup> day, the highest reduction
of amino acids in <italic>P. janthinellum</italic> SDX7 (by 95%) was observed
when treated with 5% kerosene relative to the control, which ranged from 0.05
mgmL<sup>&#x02212;15</sup> to 0.4 mgmL<sup>&#x02212;15</sup> (<xref rid="f06" ref-type="fig">Figure 6c</xref>). The optimal concentration of 3% kerosene showed less
impact on the metabolite reduction. However, the greatest reduction observed at
the higher concentration of 5% followed by the lower concentration of 1%
kerosene showed results quite well correlated with the findings of <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Standyk <italic>et al.</italic> (1971)</xref>, who
depicted concentration-dependent inhibition of amino acids and proteins at an

fungal isolate. The release of the stress metabolite phenol was significantly
stimulated after 4days of exposure, varying from 0.4 mgmL<sup>&#x02212;15</sup> to 0.64
mgmL<sup>&#x02212;15</sup> and higher in all treated cultures compared to untreated
isolate (<xref rid="f06" ref-type="fig">Figure 6d</xref>). The highest level of
phenol was observed in 5% treated isolates, showing 61%, 63%, 65% and 66%
increase on the 4<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup>, 12<sup>th</sup> and
16<sup>th</sup> days, respectively. Elevated levels of phenols might be due
to the liberation of the phenolic compounds during gradual degradation of
kerosene by hydrolysis or oxidation processes and release under stress
conditions because of the catabolic activity of primary metabolites (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Mostafa and Helling, 2002</xref>). <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Kumar and Kumar (2002)</xref> also suggested that the
release of phenols due to applications of different concentrations of fungicide
was higher than untreated cultures, possibly due to the accumulation of phenolic
compounds from the larger polycyclic aromatic compounds.</p><p>A significant positive correlation between carbohydrates, proteins and amino
acids (r = 0.88 to 0.94) was encountered, whereas a highly negative correlation
was registered with phenols (r= &#x02212;0.48 to &#x02212;0.72) after 16 days of exposure to

kerosene concentration of 3% showed the least reduction of the metabolites-
carbohydrates, proteins and amino acids compared to the 1% and 5% (v/v) kerosene
doses on the 12<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup> days of exposure. Stress
metabolite phenol was found to rise at lower and higher concentrations due to

However, the relation of&#x000a0;epidemiological measures of disease frequency based on coded information recorded in general practitioner (GP) records to parent-reported wheezing suggestive of asthma across the early life course is unclear. Linking electronic health records within longitudinal studies such as birth cohorts offers an opportunity to compare the prevalence of parent-reported wheezing with that of asthma diagnoses derived from GP records across early childhood.</p><p>We compared GP-recorded asthma diagnoses documented in linked primary care EHRs to parent-reported wheezing over the first 11 years of life in Welsh children participating in the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS).

At the age 7&#x000a0;year interview, parents of 1840 (94.3%) of 1951 singleton children interviewed in Wales gave consent to link information collected within MCS to their child&#x02019;s routine health records up to their 14th birthday.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Linked records</title><p>Linkage of MCS data to routine primary care EHRs was facilitated by the privacy protecting Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) databank, which currently has permission to use anonymised records for research from 78% of general practices in Wales.

At ages 3, 5, 7&#x000a0;and 11 years, respectively, 129, 101, 102 and 85 children were not registered with a GP during the relevant 12-month time period used to estimate period prevalence. The parents of 116, 76, 0 and 226 children did not take part at the age 3, 5, 7 and 11&#x02009;year interviews, while across all ages, a total of 17 children had missing information on reported wheeze. Thus, linked records were available for 1280 (607 girls), 1347 (645 girls), 1426 (685 girls) and 1211 (573 girls) children at ages 3, 5, 7 and 11 years, respectively, and were used to estimate prevalences.

id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>We found that both parent-reported wheezing and GP-recorded asthma diagnoses were more prevalent in the preschool years, with wheezing being significantly more prevalent than asthma diagnoses at these ages. By primary school age, there was moderate to substantial within-child agreement between the two measures. Parents of more than two-thirds of children with GP-recorded asthma diagnoses reported that their child wheezed in the preceding 12 months, and this percentage did not vary with age. Most parents of children without a GP-recorded asthma diagnosis reported that their child did not wheeze, and this percentage increased with age.</p><p>Our findings suggest that, at a population level, parent-reported wheezing prevalence is greater than GP-recorded asthma diagnosis prevalence in the preschool years, with smaller differences remaining in primary school-aged children. Differences in estimates of prevalence based on these two measures may arise for a number of reasons: parents may not take their child to the GP for wheezing, the GP may record a different diagnosis, or may not record any diagnosis, or parents may report other breath sounds as wheeze. Making a diagnosis of asthma in preschool-aged children who are generally unable to perform spirometry may be difficult. We found that other respiratory diagnoses, predominantly upper respiratory, were recorded in almost half of the preschool-aged children for whom there was no GP-recorded asthma diagnosis, lending some support for the second and fourth of these explanations. We also observed consistency between parental report of no wheezing and lack of parental-reported asthma medication use. Across all ages, around 30% of parents with a GP-recorded asthma diagnosis did not report wheezing in their child over the same 12-month period. While ISAAC questions selected a 12-month period for reporting to minimise recall bias, the possibility of such bias remains. Alternatively, asthma may be well controlled in some children with GP-recorded asthma diagnoses who may not have experienced any wheezing attacks, or children may have experienced symptoms other than wheeze, such as cough.</p><p>This is to our knowledge the first nationally representative longitudinal study to compare the prevalence of GP-recorded asthma diagnoses in EHRs with the prevalence of parent-reported wheezing across early childhood. In a smaller study using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a birth cohort from South West England, Cornish <italic>et al</italic> linked 141 cohort members to their GP records and reported 67% agreement between ever-reported wheezing in the past 12 months and GP-recorded diagnosis of asthma by 9&#x02009;years of age.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Canova <italic>et al</italic> examined the GP records of 593 children born to mothers recruited in pregnancy to a longitudinal study of asthma: agreement between parent-reported symptoms or diagnoses and GP-coded diagnoses declined with age.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Belgrave <italic>et al</italic> found comparable agreement between parental and physician ratings of wheeze in a regional birth cohort of 1184 children at ages 3, 5&#x000a0;and 8&#x000a0;years.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Mukherjee <italic>et al</italic> reported the age-standardised annual prevalence of patient-reported symptoms suggestive of asthma to be 17.1% based on responses to national surveys using standardised questionnaires; this was significantly higher than the annual age-standardised prevalence of clinician-reported-and-diagnosed asthma (5.7%) and clinician-reported-diagnosed-and-treated asthma estimated from primary care EHRs.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Direct comparison with our findings is not possible as these estimates were not based on comparisons of the same populations and were not presented for children separately.</p><p>To our knowledge, few other studies have examined the prevalence of childhood asthma in the UK using EHRs. Punekar and Sheikh<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> estimated an 18-year period prevalence of clinician-diagnosed asthma in children and adolescents across the UK to be 22.9% (95% CI 22.3% to 23.4%) from practices contributing to the General Practice Research Database. In one study from the Netherlands, Pols <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> estimated the prevalence of childhood asthma to be 6.1%, based on the requirement of at least two relevant consultations and at least two relevant prescriptions in the primary care record. This is closer to our estimate, which also included use of primary care-coded prescription as well as diagnosis.</p><p>Our estimate of the prevalence of parent-reported wheezing in the MCS 7-year-olds (13.1%) is lower than the prevalence of asthma symptoms (20.9%) in the UK reported by Asher <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> in the ISAAC global Phase Three study, a cross-sectional questionnaire survey of 193 404 children aged 6&#x02013;7 years from 37 countries. Kuehni <italic>et al</italic> reported the cross-sectional 12-month period prevalence of parent-reported wheeze in the Leicestershire longitudinal child cohort to be 12.4%, 12.5% and 20.5% at ages 3, 6 and 11 years, respectively, which is broadly consistent with our estimates.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Arathimos <italic>et al</italic> analysed sex differences in parent-reported wheezing in MCS based on the ISAAC questionnaire and estimated the cross-sectional prevalence of wheeze in all MCS participants to be 14.4% in boys and 10% in girls at age 7&#x02009;years.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
</p><p>Strengths of our study include the&#x000a0;use of a representative sample of Welsh children, high rates of consent and linkage, and adjustment for attrition and non-consent. We compared 12-month period prevalence of GP-recorded asthma diagnoses and parent-reported wheezing, allowing the age-specific relation between these measures to be assessed. Consistent and standardised definitions of wheezing and asthma diagnoses were employed at each age; however, parents were not asked to report clinician-diagnosed asthma and physiological measures of airway function were not available in our study.</p><p>It is widely acknowledged that asthma is a heterogeneous condition and that definitive diagnostic criteria for asthma are lacking; hence, we did not consider either measure as a gold standard. Validation of diagnoses recorded and coded within EHRs and the phenotypic algorithms used and assessment of their relation to existing accepted measures is needed to evaluate estimates of prevalence, causes and outcomes of chronic conditions such as childhood asthma based on EHRs.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref> Parental understanding and interpretation of the term wheeze may impact on estimates of prevalence based on parent report.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25</xref> We found increasing agreement between parent-reported wheeze and GP-recorded asthma diagnosis with age. Our findings suggest that cross-sectional prevalence estimates of GP-recorded asthma diagnoses based on coded EHRs are likely to be lower than parent-reported estimates of wheeze in preschool-aged children. These differences become much smaller at later ages. Further research is needed to evaluate the implications of these cross-sectional differences in prevalence estimates among preschool-aged children for the characterisation of longitudinal childhood asthma phenotypes<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 26 27</xref> based on EHRs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to the Centre for Longitudinal Studies, UCL Institute of Education and the UK Data Service as well as the providers of anonymised data held in the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) system, which is part of the national e-health records research infrastructure for Wales.

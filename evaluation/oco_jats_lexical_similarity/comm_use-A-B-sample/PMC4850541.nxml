Over the same period, child and maternal mortality declined by 71% and 72%, respectively.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref></p><p>The actions and approaches required to achieve the objectives of the global strategy (2016&#x02013;2030)<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> converge around five main drivers of change: people; political effectiveness; programmes; partnerships; and principles. The following sections highlight how some countries have already begun achieving these transformative changes (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="B1">Box&#x000a0;1</xref>).</p><p>The global strategy (2016&#x02013;2030) emphasizes the importance of measures to help all women, children and adolescents to realize their rights and full potential for health and well-being. These measures include policies and programmes for early childhood development and adolescent health. Removing barriers to enjoyment of rights&#x02013; such as those to gender-equality and women&#x02019;s socioeconomic and political participation are also important measures.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref></p><p>Evidence shows that early childhood development programmes have significant long-term health and socioeconomic advantages. Parenting resources for early childhood development, school-community outreach and health services have measureable physical, intellectual and socioeconomic benefits for children, their families and communities. Such actions can reduce health, special schooling and criminal justice expenditures.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref></p><p>Healthy, educated adolescents can better realize their potential, contribute to the demographic dividend and economic growth, as seen in east Asia in the 1980s and 1990s.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Evidence shows that with investment and political commitment for adolescent health and development, rapid progress can be made.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Now, countries such as Argentina, Colombia, Estonia, Ethiopia, India, the Republic of Moldova, Senegal and Uganda are investing in large-scale adolescent health and development programmes to gain similar dividends. Investments could help countries in sub-Saharan Africa realize annual dividends of at least 500 billion United States dollars (US$), equal to about one third of the region&#x02019;s current gross domestic product, for as many as 30 years.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref></p><p>Women&#x02019;s social, political and economic participation is associated with better health outcomes for women and children.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> In Rwanda, where 64% of parliamentarians are women and where the parliament has committed to and invested in health and development, maternal and child mortality declined by 78% and 72%, respectively, between 1990 and 2015.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> At community level, women&#x02019;s groups in Bangladesh, India, Malawi and Nepal contributed to better access to quality health services and improved maternal and newborn health.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref></p><p>Leadership at all levels of society is a proven prerequisite for progress.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> In Kyrgyzstan, committed political leadership, clear policy, management capacity and low staff turnover in the health ministry contributed to sustained financing, improved health services and a reduction of child mortality by almost two thirds since 1990.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Political effectiveness can also drive cross-sector action to address diverse determinants of health. Collaboration across sectors during the MDG era helped some countries to accelerate progress to reduce mortality, malnutrition and gender inequality, to strengthen health and education systems and to improve water quality, sanitation and infrastructure.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref></p><p>Robust data and analysis are essential to enable accountability through a cycle of monitoring, independent review and action to ensure that programmes and policies are achieving their desired objectives. For example, in Mozambique a coalition of partners invested in the country&#x02019;s civil registration and vital statistics system, increasing registered deaths by 18% from 2012 to 2014 and enabling routine reporting of causes of death by sex and age for the first time since 1975 (Commission on Information and Accountability, Mozambique, unpublished data, December 14, 2015).</p><p>To strengthen accountability, at least 50 countries with a high burden of maternal and child mortality had regular national health sector review processes that met basic accountability criteria in 2015, and another 36 countries had adopted the good governance for medicines approach to battle corruption.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref></p><p>Quality programmes in health and other sectors, and for research and innovation, can catalyse change, even in humanitarian and fragile settings. While resilient health systems and universal coverage of quality care are gold standards for women&#x02019;s, children&#x02019;s and adolescents&#x02019; health, catastrophic events can swiftly undo hard-won health gains, particularly where existing health systems are weak. For example, during the 2013&#x02013;2016 Ebola disease outbreak in Liberia, skilled birth attendance fell from 52% to 38%, vaccination rates dropped and 64% of health facilities were not operational.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref></p><p>Experience shows that quality care is possible even under extreme circumstances. In Jordan, humanitarian and development partners have collaborated to give all residents of Za&#x02019;atari refugee camp access to maternal and child health centres, while additional health centres serve Syrian refugees who are not living in camps.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> The global strategy (2016&#x02013;2030) highlights the importance of expanding such collaborative practices and improving emergency preparedness at all levels of the health system.</p><p>While the health sector remains central for people&#x02019;s health, there is evidence that in low- and middle-income countries about 50% of gains in women&#x02019;s and children&#x02019;s health since 1990 have resulted from progress in non-health sectors.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Investments in nutrition, water and sanitation were essential in eradicating polio in India, which was certified as polio-free in 2014. Previous efforts, focused on vaccination alone, were insufficient because malnourishment and diarrhoea from unsafe water and inadequate sanitation limited vaccine effectiveness.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Education is also critical to improving health and well-being. In Malawi, conditional cash transfers to encourage school attendance by girls were associated with reductions in teenage pregnancies, early marriage and human immunodeficiency virus infections.</p><p>Evidence shows that knowledge and innovation are at least as important as economic resources in improving health and well-being and driving development. Research to help countries understand and overcome barriers is required in areas such as: policy, implementation and operational research; clinical research and systematic evidence reviews; disaster risk reduction and preparedness; social, behavioural, anthropological and community research; and political and social sciences.</p><p>Multistakeholder and cross-sector partnerships are critical drivers of change. In the United Republic of Tanzania, the White Ribbon Alliance for Safe Motherhood united civil society members, health professionals, academics, donors and United Nations (UN) partners in a successful three-year campaign to improve access to comprehensive emergency obstetric and newborn care at health centres.</p><p>Effective global partnerships can catalyse and support country efforts. For example, the Every Woman Every Child movement attracted more than US$60 billion dollars to women&#x02019;s and children&#x02019;s health between 2010 and 2015, with commitments from over 300 partners.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref></p><p>The movement has spurred partnership mechanisms to support country-led implementation of the global strategy (2016&#x02013;2030) &#x02013; including the Global Financing Facility in support of Every Woman Every Child, the Innovation Marketplace, Unified Accountability Framework and the UN system&#x02019;s health agencies&#x02019; H6 partnership.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref></p><p>The global strategy (2016&#x02013;2030) recognizes that human rights and other fundamental development principles &#x02013; such as equity, community ownership and development effectiveness &#x02013; are drivers of transformative change.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref></p><p>In Peru, principles of equity underpinned a programme of poverty mapping to identify and prioritize reaching poor, rural and indigenous populations with social protection programmes and culturally appropriate, affordable care.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> In Kenya, the institutionalization of human rights principles is benefiting women&#x02019;s health following complaints alleging systematic violation of women&#x02019;s reproductive health rights in health facilities.</p><p>The global strategy (2016&#x02013;2030) provides knowledge for integrated actions both within the health sector and with other sectors, based on country experience and current evidence. With its accompanying operational framework, the strategy serves as a roadmap for collective action to advance the health and well-being of women, children and adolescents, which will be central to achieving the SDGs.</p></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Acknowledging colleagues in the Every Woman Every Child global strategy work streams and over 7000 individuals and organizations who contributed in writing and through consultations to the global strategy.</p></ack><fn-group><title>Competing interests:</title><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><source>Global Strategy for Women&#x02019;s, Children&#x02019;s and Adolescents&#x02019; Health (2016&#x02013;2030).</source>

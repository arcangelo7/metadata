Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for osteoblast suppression, are limited. Using the 5T2MM murine model of MM we have previously shown that suppression of the activity of a known inhibitor of bone formation Dikkopf-1 (Dkk1) prevents the development of lytic bone disease. Here we have demonstrated that another potential inhibitor of bone formation, sclerostin domain containing 1 (Sostdc1) is expressed at low levels in MM and osteoblast lineage cells when these cells are grown separately in cell culture but its expression is significantly induced in both cell types when these cells are in contact. The distribution of Sostdc1 staining in bones infiltrated with 5TGM1 myeloma cells <italic>in vivo</italic> suggested its presence in both myeloma and osteoblast lineage populations when in close proximity. We have also shown that recombinant Sostdc1 inhibits both bone morphogenic proteins (BMP2 and 7) and Wnt signalling in primary osteoblasts and suppresses differentiation of these cells. Together, these findings suggest that Sostdc1 expression in 5TGM1-infiltrated bones as a result of the interaction between myeloma and osteoblast lineage populations, could result in suppression of osteoblast differentiation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="ab0010"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="l0005"><list-item id="li0005"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0005">Sostdc1 is a potent suppressor of osteoblast differentiation.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010">Sostdc1in osteoblast and myeloma cells is induced when these cells interact.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">Sostdc1 down regulates Wnt-BMP signalling crosstalk in osteoblasts.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0020">Sostdc1 is present in myeloma-infiltrated bone disease and not present in normal bone.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="ks0005"><title>Abbreviations</title><kwd>CTNNB1, &#x003b2;-catenin</kwd><kwd>BMP, bone morphogenetic protein</kwd><kwd>B2M, &#x003b2;-microglobulin</kwd><kwd>chr, chromosome</kwd><kwd>Dkk1, Dikkopf-1</kwd><kwd>DAB, diaminobenzidine</kwd><kwd>Frz, frizzled</kwd><kwd>GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase</kwd><kwd>GFP, green fluorescent protein</kwd><kwd>HGF, hepatocyte growth factor</kwd><kwd>HRP, horse radish peroxidase</kwd><kwd>IL, interleukin</kwd><kwd>LRP, lipoprotein-related protein</kwd><kwd>MM, multiple myeloma</kwd><kwd>OB, osteoblast</kwd><kwd>OGM, osteogenic medium</kwd><kwd>Runx, runt-related transcription factor</kwd><kwd>SMAD, C. elegans SMA/Drosophila mothers against decapentaplegic homolog</kwd><kwd>Sostdc1, sclerostin domain containing 1</kwd><kwd>SOST, sclerostin</kwd><kwd>sFRP, secreted frizzled-related protein</kwd><kwd>Wnt, wingless-related integration site</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group id="ks0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Sostdc1</kwd><kwd>Multiple myeloma</kwd><kwd>Bone morphogenic proteins</kwd><kwd>Wnt</kwd><kwd>Osteoblastogenesis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0025">Recently, studies have shown that multiple myeloma (MM) cells arriving in bone occupy niches, where they interact with specific bone cell lineages [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>]. Myeloma cells held within niches are in a mitotically dormant state and this is maintained until they are released, leading to the development of lytic bone disease in 90% of patients [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Dormancy allows single tumour cells establishing residency in bone time to adapt to new environmental influences and to avoid the effects of drugs that target proliferating cells. The composition of the niche and how this controls dormancy are not well understood, but there is evidence that osteoblast (OB) lineage cells are important components. Lytic bone disease associated with myeloma growth has, however, been extensively studied [<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and colonised bone is characterised by reduced osteoblastogenesis [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Osteolytic lesions arise in close proximity to the tumour, suggesting that close contact between myeloma cells and bone cells is required to influence bone remodelling [<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A number of molecules have been implicated in the suppression of OB differentiation in MM including the wingless-related integration site (Wnt)-signalling inhibitor Dickkopf-related protein 1 (Dkk1) [<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (sFRP-2) [<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], interleukin 7 (IL-7) [<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) [<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], IL-3 [<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and sclerostin (SOST) [<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Antibodies to Dkk1 and SOST prevent the suppression of OB differentiation and the development of lytic bone disease <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, there are likely to be other regulators that contribute to OB suppression in myeloma-induced bone disease [<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p id="p0030">In this study we aimed to identify other important factors involved in the development of myeloma-induced bone disease, using the 5TGM1 syngeneic murine model that develops osteolytic lesions in infiltrated bones [<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. SOST and Sostdc1 are proteins with ~55% homology in humans and both mediate suppression of bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) and Wnt signalling [<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In humans, the <italic>SOST</italic> gene is located on chromosome 17 (Sost: chr 12 in mouse) and <italic>Sostdc1</italic> on chromosome 7 (Sostdc1: chr 11 in mouse), the presence of the 2 genes being a result of past gene duplication where some division of product function has evolved [<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The effective functional differences between the 2 proteins appears to result from the distribution of the expression of the genes with SOST being highly expressed in bone and Sostdc1 being expressed in the kidney, tooth buds, and lung tissue. Studies with knock-out mice show that loss of SOST expression results in sclerosteosis in the axial skeleton, while there is no general bone phenotype in Sostdc1 knock out mice apart from effects in the teeth including fusion and extra incisors [<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The factors that control the expression of these genes in specific locations are not fully understood but it is suggested that BMPs/transforming growth factor &#x003b2;s and fibroblast growth factors, as well as vitamin D signalling, regulate transcription of both genes. The segregation of expression of each protein to different anatomical sites would suggest the need for control of action and that inappropriate expression in tissues could have deleterious effects, as suggested by recent studies of the formation of digits in experimental animals [<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p id="p0035">As Sostdc1 is a putative inhibitor of OB differentiation that is not expressed in adult bone, its presence in MM cells and in myeloma-infiltrated bones would make it an interesting candidate in the context of myeloma-induced bone disease. We have shown that MM and OB lineage cells produce little Sostdc1 until they are in close proximity to each other, when the protein is induced in both cell types. We subsequently evaluated the function of this protein in <italic>in vitro</italic> OB differentiation assays.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Ethics statement</title><p id="p0040">All procedures involving mice were conducted at the University of Sheffield, UK and were approved by the Home Office (PPL 40/3462) and the University of Sheffield's Animal Ethics Committee in accordance with the Animal [Scientific Procedures] Act 1986 and ARRIVE guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>2.2</label><title>Calvarial primary OB isolation and differentiation</title><p id="p0045">Mouse primary OB progenitor cells were isolated from the calvarial bones of 2 to 4&#x0202f;day old C57BLKaLwRij mice (Harlan, UK) using Collagenase I (1&#x0202f;mg/ml, Sigma Aldrich) digestion solution as previously described [<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].

The antibody used in these analyses and in studies with cell cultures to detect Sostdc1 was specific for this protein and was raised to a unique epitope not present on sclerostin. The presence of Sosdc1 in myeloma-infiltrated bones is novel and unexpected finding as this protein is not normally expressed in bone [<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. While immunohistochemistry showed protein expression within the 5TGM1 myeloma cells, it should be noted that the bones examined were well infiltrated at the time of sacrifice, a point where there were few visible osteoblastic cells remaining near to the myeloma colonies. This is not surprising since our studies have shown that recombinant Sostdc1 has potent effects in suppressing OB differentiation, specifically interfering with known pathways that drive this process. We initially thought that the myeloma cells themselves were the sole source of this protein in lesions. However, our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies showed that myeloma cells produced very low levels of Sostdc1 and the protein is undetectable in OB progenitor cells, when these cells are grown alone. In co-cultures, Sostdc1 expression and protein levels were induced in both cell types.

Together these findings support the concept that Sostdc1 produced by interacting 5TGM1 and OB lineage cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, would induce the loss of OBs from bone. This alteration in the bone microenvironment may have effects on MM interactions with bone populations affecting myeloma cell survival and dormancy [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].

These findings are similar to those of Laurikkala et al., which found the mouse orthologue of Sostdc1 inhibited both Wnt and BMP-induced MC3T3-E1 differentiation [<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Interestingly though in our studies, Dkk1 had no significant effect on Wnt3a stimulated <italic>Runx2</italic> expression. However, since Sostdc1 acts on osteoblast progenitors and Dkk1 is secreted from mature osteoblasts, to inhibit Wnt signalling of osteoblast precursors [<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], it is entirely possible that the time points that we see significant suppressive effects of Sostdc1 differ from those of Dkk1.</p><p id="p0185">We also showed that in the presence of Wnt3a, Sostdc1 reduced &#x003b2;-catenin levels in OB progenitor cells. The suppression of Wnt3A induced a reduction in total &#x003b2;-catenin protein levels as well as decreases in the levels of activated (phosphorylated) forms of this protein in cultures of human osteoblastic cells in the presence of Sostdc1 (<xref rid="ec0005" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Similarly, the addition of Sostdc1 in the presence of BMP ligands reversed BMP-induced Smad phosphorylation. These observations suggest that the activities of Sostdc1 modulate both signalling systems involved in OB differentiation. Other studies have demonstrated a synergistic relationship between BMP and &#x003b2;-catenin during OB differentiation [<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>]. Secreted molecules such as cerberus and sclerostin, also inhibit OB activity by binding BMP/Wnt ligands [<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and receptors [<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, the regulatory role of Sostdc1 on Wnt-BMP crosstalk in differentiating OB progenitors has not been studied. Our data showed that treatment of differentiating OB with Wnt3a increased Smad phosphorylation and treatment with BMP2/7 enhanced Wnt signalling <italic>via</italic> &#x003b2;-catenin modulation. Similarly Zhang et al. reported that Wnt3a increased transcriptional activity of a BMP/Smad reporter and that co-treatment with a known inhibitor of BMP signalling, noggin, inhibited this effect [<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Here we have shown that Sostdc1 negatively affected Wnt-BMP cooperation mediated by &#x003b2;-catenin-and regulatory-Smads in OB progenitors.</p><p id="p0195">Lintern and Guidato et al. showed Sostdc1 may have separate domains for Wnt and BMP interaction, showing the independent binding capabilities of Sostdc1 to LRP6 receptor and BMP ligands [<xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Our interferometry data showed recombinant Sostdc1 had a highest binding affinity for BMP7, followed by LRP6 and lastly BMP2. These findings provide direct evidence that Sostdc1 has the capacity to interact with both BMP and Wnt signalling systems but may suggest selectivity for individual components although it can act as an effective antagonist for both pathways.</p><p id="p0200">Our studies suggest Sostdc1 antagonises Wnt-BMP signalling in the early phase of OB differentiation. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have suggested that Dkk1 mainly affects the function of mature OB cells and drives pluripotent cells to differentiate to OB lineages [<xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Rawadi et al. demonstrated that blocking Wnt/LRP5 signalling with Dkk1 in mesenchymal stem cells inhibited BMP2-induced alkaline phosphatase activity [<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Dkk1 has also been shown to target BMPRIA, a BMP receptor in OBs, and mediate suppression of BMP signalling in mature bone. As Sostdc1 and Dkk1 both target the LRP/Frz-Wnt receptors and regulate Wnt-BMP crosstalk in OB progenitors, either molecule may be active at various stages in the development of myeloma-induced lytic bone disease: Dkk1 having a role in targeting mature OB cells, while Sostdc1 affects the maturation of OB progenitors.</p><p id="p0205">In conclusion, we have shown that Sostdc1 is a potent suppressor of OB differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic> and that the production of this protein in OBs and myeloma cells is induced when these cells interact with each other. This is the first report showing the induced production of this protein by MM-OB interactions. These findings may suggest that targeting the induced production of Sostdc1 in MM infiltrated bones could have benefits in suppressing disease progression in MM.</p><p id="p0210">The following is the supplementary data related to this article.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ec0005"><caption><title>Supplementary Fig. 1</title><p>Sostdc1 suppressed Wnt3a-induced active and total &#x003b2;-catenin levels: Saos2 cells were treated with 50&#x0202f;ng/ml Wnt3a in the presence or absence of 250&#x0202f;ng/ml Sostdc1 or 100&#x0202f;ng/ml Dkk1 recombinant protein.

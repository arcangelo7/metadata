Both AFF1 and AFF4 regulate gene transcription through elongation and chromatin remodeling. However, their function in the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is unknown. In this study, we show that small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated depletion of AFF1 in human MSCs leads to increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, enhanced mineralization and upregulated expression of osteogenic-related genes. On the contrary, depletion of AFF4 significantly inhibits the osteogenic potential of MSCs. In addition, we confirm that overexpression of AFF1 and AFF4 differentially affects osteogenic differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic> and MSC-mediated bone formation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Mechanistically, we find that AFF1 regulates the expression of DKK1 via binding to its promoter region. Depletion of DKK1 in HA-AFF1-overexpressing MSCs abrogates the impairment of osteogenic differentiation. Moreover, we detect that AFF4 is enriched in the promoter region of <italic>ID1</italic>. AFF4 knockdown blunts the BRE luciferase activity, <italic>SP7</italic> expression and ALP activity induced by BMP2 treatment. In conclusion, our data indicate that AFF1 and AFF4 differentially regulate the osteogenic differentiation of human MSCs.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are pluripotent stem cells that can differentiate into osteoblastic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic lineages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> The bone marrow is the main source of stem cells for mesenchymal tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> Apart from that, MSCs can also be found in many other parts of the human body, including adipose tissue, chorionic villi of the placenta, amniotic fluid, peripheral blood, fetal liver, lung, and teeth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3 bib4 bib5 bib6">3&#x02013;6</xref></sup></p><p>The osteogenic differentiation of MSCs is a complex process involving numerous signal molecules, including key transcription factors such as runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and Osterix, as well as various hormones.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7 bib8 bib9 bib10 bib11">7&#x02013;11</xref></sup> In addition, the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;) signaling pathways are indispensable during the osteogenic process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12 bib13 bib14 bib15">12&#x02013;15</xref></sup> Recently, accumulating evidence has shown that epigenetic regulation plays a pivotal role in the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16 bib17 bib18">16&#x02013;18</xref></sup> DNA methylation and histone modifications are the major mammalian epigenetic mechanisms involved in the progression from MSCs into terminally differentiated cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19 bib20 bib21">19&#x02013;21</xref></sup> For example, the expression level of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) is decreased during osteoblast differentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup></p><p>Both AFF1 and AFF4 belong to the AFF (AF4/FMR2) family and regulate gene transcription epigenetically through elongation and chromatin remodeling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22 bib23 bib24">22&#x02013;24</xref></sup> They share three conserved domains: an N-terminal homology domain, an AF4/lymphoid nuclear protein domain, and a C-terminal homology domain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> Both function as scaffolding proteins linking two different transcription elongation factors, positive elongation factor b (P-TEFb) and ELL1/2, in super elongation complexes (SECs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> Studies have shown that AFF1 and AFF4 are associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and FRAXE mental retardation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27 bib28 bib29 bib30 bib31">27&#x02013;31</xref></sup> AFF1 promotes CD133 transcription and leukemia cell survival in multiple cancer cell lines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> AFF1 and AFF4 also play important roles in HIV transactivation and are closely associated with HIV-1 Tat.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> However, the role of AFF1 and AFF4 in MSC osteogenic differentiation is largely unknown.</p><p>Although AFF1 and AFF4 are members of the same protein family with common structures and functions, we show that they differentially regulate the osteogenic differentiation of human MSCs <italic>in vitro</italic> and MSC-mediated bone formation <italic>in vivo</italic>.

We then performed a ChIP assay and observed that AFF4 was enriched in the promoter region of ID1, suggesting that AFF4 might control osteogenic differentiation via the BMP pathway by regulating <italic>ID1</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). To this end, we performed a BRE luciferase assay and found that AFF4 depletion markedly restricted BMP2-induced responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>). As BMP2 induces the expression SP7, a master transcription factor for osteogenic differentiation, we examined whether this induction requires AFF4. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that deletion of AFF4 blunted the expression of <italic>SP7</italic> induced by BMP2 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>).

In the present study, we show that AFF1 depletion enhances the expression of osteogenic-related genes, ALP activity and mineralization. Overexpression of AFF1 impairs osteogenic differentiation and MSC-mediated bone formation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Conversely, we find that AFF4, another member of the AFF family, has an opposite regulatory function in the expression of osteogenic-related genes, ALP activity and mineralization <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as in bone formation <italic>in vivo</italic>. These findings indicate that AFF1 and AFF4 differentially regulate the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. The expression levels of AFF2 and 3 are too low to be detected in hMSCs (unpublished data).</p><p>AFF1 and AFF4 share some conserved functional domains in their protein structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup> Both of them are reported to form fusion genes with the mixed lineage leukemia <italic>(MLL)</italic> gene, which is associated with leukemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> Both AFF1 and AFF4 act as partners of P-TEFb to regulate transcription elongation. Previous studies have shown that either AFF1 or AFF4 could participate in the formation of different SEC subtypes by serving as a scaffolding protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> Other researchers also found that AFF4 binds to Tat-P-TEFb, which indirectly stimulates recognition of the HIV promoter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> In addition, both AFF1 and AFF4 are scaffolding proteins that link different parts of SECs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> Despite these similarities, these two proteins have opposite effects on the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Overexpression of AFF1 impairs MSC-mediated bone formation, whereas overexpression of AFF4 enhances this process. Mechanistically, ChIP experiments suggest that both AFF1 and AFF4 could function as transcription factors to mediate the transcriptional activation of the key regulators in MSC osteogenic differentiation by binding to the promoter regions of these genes. AFF1, but not AFF4, affects differentiation by regulating <italic>DKK1</italic> transcription, while AFF4 regulates <italic>ID1</italic> transcription to control osteoblastic differentiation through the BMP pathway. These findings are consistent with a previous report that demonstrated that genes regulated by SECs containing AFF1 or AFF4 are largely non-overlapping.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></sup></p><p>On the basis on previous studies and the findings of this study, we speculate that there are several potential reasons for the different effects of AFF1 and AFF4 on the osteoblastic differentiation of MSCs. It is well known that SECs regulate gene expression at the transcriptional level.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> Although AFF1 and AFF4 are components of SECs, they may be independently localized and are not found together in a single SEC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></sup> These two proteins may also form a heterodimer, which is not necessary in SEC assembly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></sup> A previous study showed that the subnuclear distribution of AFF1 is diffuse, while AFF4 is mainly found on SC35 in nuclear speckles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> Furthermore, the gene targets of AFF1 and AFF4 are largely distinct.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></sup> Taken together, our data further demonstrated that these two proteins function differently during osteogenesis by regulating different signal pathways.</p><p>In summary, we show that AFF1 and AFF4 differentially regulate the osteogenic differentiation of human MSCs <italic>in vitro</italic> and MSC-mediated bone formation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Mechanically, AFF1 controls the transcription of DDK1, while AFF4 is required for ID1 transcription and BMP2-induced responses. Our data indicate that AFF1 and AFF4 are critical epigenetic regulators of the osteogenic differentiation of human MSCs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC, 81722014, 81571001, 81500354, and 81621062), Sichuan Province Science and Technology Innovation Team Program (2017TD0016), and State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases (SKLOD201704).</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="bib1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">Bianco P, Robey PG, Simmons PJ. <article-title>Mesenchymal stem cells: revisiting history, concepts, and assays</article-title>. <source>Cell Stem Cell</source>

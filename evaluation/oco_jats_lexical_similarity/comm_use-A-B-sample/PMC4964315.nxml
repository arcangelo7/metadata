Skin contributes in maintaining the fluid homeostasis, regulating the thermo effects, sending sensory signals to the brain, and metabolizing various substances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The skin is also the first barrier to protect the body against the infections from the environment. Any damage of this physical barrier may lead to attacks of pathogens and consequently cause infection in the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].

The high level of MDA produced in the tissues indicates that the tissues might be injured and DNA might be damaged. In the other hand, the excessive MDA could bind to free amino groups of proteins and result in the formation of MDA-modified protein adducts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Therefore we decided to examine the effect of <italic>betle</italic> leaf extract on the levels of MDA in liver and leg soft tissues of mice. Our results showed that levels of MDA in liver and leg soft tissues of <italic>betle</italic>-treated mice were 18&#x000a0;% and 7&#x000a0;% lower than that of non-treated mice, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Effects of leaf extract (5&#x000a0;% w/w gel) on concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA) in liver tissues (<bold>a</bold>) and leg soft tissues (<bold>b</bold>) of non-treated (NC) and <italic>betle</italic>-treated mices were examined by MDA analysis. **, Significantly different (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) from the control by Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41038_2015_23_Fig6_HTML" id="MO6"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we consecutively used three organic solvents with gradually increase in polarity including n-hexane, ethylacetate and methanol to extract phytochemicals in the <italic>betle</italic>. In generally, the two first solvents of n-hexane and ethylacetate are used to eliminate of substances which have non- or low- biological activities from the samples before extracting in methanol to collect substances which have biological activities. And then, we had tried to investigate the effects of not only methanol extract but also n-hexane and ethylacetate extracts on NIH3T3 cells, however, it was not showed the impressive effects of n-hexane and ethylacetate extracts on the cells (data not shown).</p><p>However, our <italic>in vitro</italic> results of this study showed that at the concentrations of 2.5-5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL <italic>betle</italic> leaf extract in methanol had positive effects on proliferation of NIH3T3 cells. Basing on this, we chose the concentration of 5&#x000a0;% (v/v) of drug gel for <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments but not perform a real dose-dependent curve to obtain EC50 and EC05. Because our methanol extract used in this study was still in crude form (i.e., there may have many substances in the extract). It was not so important to determine the very precise concentration of the crude extract; however this kind of experiment should be done in case of using single substance. Therefore, we followed the previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] to select the concentration of extract for <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments as about 10 times higher than that used for <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments (5&#x000a0;%&#x000a0;V/V).</p><p>Our <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments revealed that <italic>betle</italic> leaf extract gel significantly increased healing rates of burn wounds and excision wounds in swiss mice. Moreover, statistical results by two-way Anova with replication analysis and Tukey&#x02019;s HSD post-hoc test showed that burn wound healing were affected by both leaf extract and treatment time and there were interaction between these two factors in both cases of burn wound (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) and excision wound (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). In the case of burn wound, it was also indicated that <italic>betle</italic> leaf extract had the strongest effect on wound healing in the period of 2&#x02013;4 days post wound making (PWM), followed by periods of 0&#x02013;2 days PWM the smallest effect in the period of 4&#x02013;6 days PWM with significant differences (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In the case of excision wound, in the period of 0&#x02013;3 days PWM, there was no difference in wound healing rate between control groups and treated groups; however, at the period of 3&#x02013;7 days PWM, the effect of <italic>betle</italic> leaf extract was strongest and followed by period of 7&#x02013;15 days PWM with significant differences (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). These statistic results may suggest a hint that we can screen various leaf extracts on wound healing activities and determine the wound healing effects of these extracts at different periods during treatment times to develop an optimum clinical protocol by changing or combining of these various leaf extracts.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Two-way Anova with replication analysis and Tukey&#x02019;s HSD post-hoc test showed combination effects of leaf extract and treatment time on burn wound healing</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td/><td>Day 0</td><td>Day 2</td><td>Line segment slopes</td><td>Absolute difference between slopes</td></tr><tr><td>NC</td><td>120</td><td>94.8</td><td>&#x02212;25.2</td><td>12.4</td></tr><tr><td>TR</td><td>120</td><td>82.4</td><td>&#x02212;37.6</td><td/></tr><tr><td/><td>Day 2</td><td>Day 4</td><td>Line segment slopes</td><td>Absolute difference between slopes</td></tr><tr><td>NC</td><td>94.8</td><td>74.4</td><td>&#x02212;20.4</td><td>23.0</td></tr><tr><td>TR</td><td>82.4</td><td>39</td><td>&#x02212;43.4</td><td/></tr><tr><td/><td>Day 4</td><td>Day 6</td><td>Line segment slopes</td><td>Absolute difference between slopes</td></tr><tr><td>NC</td><td>74.4</td><td>67</td><td>&#x02212;7.4</td><td>8.4</td></tr><tr><td>TR</td><td>39</td><td>23.2</td><td>&#x02212;15.8</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Two-way Anova with replication analysis and Tukey&#x02019;s HSD post-hoc test showed combination effects of extract and treatment time on excision wound healing</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td/><td>Day 0</td><td>Day 3</td><td>Line segment slope</td><td>Absolute difference between slopes</td></tr><tr><td>NC</td><td>120</td><td>110</td><td>&#x02212;10</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>TR</td><td>120</td><td>110</td><td>&#x02212;10</td><td/></tr><tr><td/><td>Day 3</td><td>Day 7</td><td>Line segment slope</td><td>Absolute difference between slopes</td></tr><tr><td>NC</td><td>110</td><td>85.8</td><td>&#x02212;34.2</td><td>18.6</td></tr><tr><td>TR</td><td>110</td><td>67.2</td><td>&#x02212;52.8</td><td/></tr><tr><td/><td>Day 7</td><td>Day 15</td><td>Line segment slopes</td><td>Absolute difference between slopes</td></tr><tr><td>NC</td><td>85.8</td><td>22</td><td>&#x02212;63.8</td><td>3.8</td></tr><tr><td>TR</td><td>67.2</td><td>7.2</td><td>&#x02212;60</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this preliminary research, we also found that <italic>betle</italic> can induce proliferation of fibroblast cells and promote wound healing in swiss mice but not caused to any strange behavior or phenomenon of treated mice.

vasodilator support, or a right ventricular assist device (RVAD). Right ventricular
failure following the implantation of ventricular assist devices (VAD) has been
shown to be a strong predictor of increased postoperative morbidity and
mortality<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. It is
believed that low intraventricular pressure caused by left ventricular assist
devices (LVAD) can lead to a shift in the position of the interventricular septum
(bulging to the left). Consequently, the right ventricle (RV) loses its triangular
shape and ability to contract against the intraventricular septum, causing increased
right ventricular volume and worsening of tricuspid regurgitation<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The last decade has seen considerable growth in the use of LVAD in end-phase heart
failure treatment. The indications, contraindications and implantation techniques
are well-defined. However, the same cannot be said about mechanical support for
right ventricular failure. Mechanical support for RV defects has been performed with
paracorporeal pumps. Some studies describe the use of intracorporeal LVAD to support
failing RV. However, there is lack of information regarding optimal cannulation
site, pump rotor speed, flow, waveforms, and anticoagulation.</p><p>The aim of this communication is to present alternative techniques for implanting
short- and long-term RVAD.</p></sec><sec><title>CASE ILLUSTRATION</title><sec><title>Case #1</title><p>A 52-year-old woman with a history of end-stage heart failure, secondary to
ischemic cardiomyopathy, and undergoing optimized medical therapy presented New
York Heart Association (NYHA) class III symptoms associated with signs of
biventricular dysfunction. The transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated global
hypokinesis and an estimated ejection fraction of 15%, also severe mitral valve
regurgitation and right ventricular dilation. Right cardiac catheterization
confirmed low cardiac output (CO: 2.8 L/min - index 1.5 L/min/m<sup>2</sup>),
elevated central venous pressure (CVP: 16 mmHg), systolic pulmonary hypertension
(PA: 72 mmHg), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR: 629
dynes/sec/cm<sup>5</sup>), and the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP: 20
mmHg).</p><p>The patient was started on intravenous inotropic therapy (milrinone 0.5
mcg/kg/min), a systemic vasoconstrictor (vasopressin 0.02 mcg/kg/min) and a
diuretic (furosemide 10 mg/h). After clinical improvement and complete
preoperative evaluation, the patient was presented to our multidisciplinary
heart failure group for consideration of VAD implantation.</p><p>The planned operation consisted of LVAD implantation (HeartWare), tricuspid valve
repair, and percutaneous implantation of temporary right ventricular mechanical
support (Impella RP). After two weeks with biventricular support, with an LVAD
flow of 5.2 L/min and an RVAD flow of 4.8 L/min, the echocardiogram did not
demonstrate an improved right ventricular function, despite moderate doses of
inotropes. The patient was returned to the operating room for the removal of the
temporary RVAD support and implantation of an intracorporeal RVAD (HeartWare)
for long-term support.</p><p>During a short extracorporeal circulation period, HeartWare was implanted in the
right pleural space with the inflow cannula tunneled through the pericardium and
lateral wall of the right atrium (RA). Several felt rings were attached to the
sewing ring to adjust the depth of the inflow cannula in the right atrial
cavity. An outflow graft with no flow restriction was anastomosed to the main
pulmonary artery.</p><p>The devices maintained excellent flow, with the RVAD operating at 5.2 L/min at
2400 rpm and the LVAD at 5.6 L/min. After satisfactory evolution of clinical,
laboratory and radiological parameters, the patient was weaned off the
mechanical ventilator and was discharged to home. Patient underwent
transplantation seven months after VAD implantation.</p></sec><sec><title>Case #2</title><p>A 62-year-old woman with history of dilated cardiomyopathy, on the list for an
orthotopic heart transplant. While waiting for the transplant and receiving
intravenous inotropic medication, she suffered severe hemodynamic
decompensation.</p><p>The echocardiogram demonstrated low left ventricular ejection fraction and
moderate right ventricular dysfunction. Right cardiac catheterization showed
systolic pulmonary hypertension (PA: 4 mmHg), elevated CVP (12 mmHg), low CO
(1.6 L/min/m<sup>2</sup>), PVR (509 dynes/sec/cm<sup>5</sup>), and the PCWP (18
mmHg).</p><p>The patient underwent implantation of a LVAD (HeartMate II). The immediate
postoperative period was marked by low pulsatile flow of the left ventricular
device associated with low pulsatility index, high CVP, systemic arterial
hypotension, and low CO. The echocardiogram showed satisfactory cannula
position, enlarged RA and RV, and severe tricuspid regurgitation.</p><p>After two days of RV support with high doses of inotropic medication, financial
authorization was granted for the implantation of an RVAD. During a short period
of extracorporeal circulation, the defibrillator leads were removed and a
HeartWare VAD was implanted with an inflow cannula through the diaphragmatic
surface of the RV. The inflow cannula was adjusted to a suitable depth. The
external outflow graft, with 50% reduction in diameter, was anastomosed to the
main pulmonary artery.</p><p>Excellent flow was obtained with the HeartWare and HeartMate II pumps operating
at 2400 rpm and 8200 rpm, respectively.</p><p>On postoperative day 5, the patient presented an abrupt decrease in left
ventricle support flow associated with elevated CVP, reduced CO, and elevation
in HeartWare RVAD pump power. Laboratory exams were compatible with
hemolysis.</p><p>During the emergency surgery, a thrombus was confirmed in the RVAD. The tricuspid
valve leaflets were partially obstructing the RVAD inflow cannula, predisposing
to stagnated flow and thrombosis.</p><p>After tricuspid valve resection, a new VAD was implanted (HeartWare) with no
restriction in the outflow graft. With the new device operating at 2200 rpm,
excellent biventricular flow was obtained. The HeartWare RVAD was removed and
another HeartWare was implanted.</p><p>The patient recovered well and she was eventually discharged to home. Six months
after the implantation, the patient underwent a successful heart
transplantation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In general, patients with biventricular assist devices present lower survival rates
in comparison with those with single LVAD (53% <italic>vs.</italic> 80%). The
inferior survival rates of patients with biventricular support can be explained by
patient selection and/ or increased incidence of associated comorbidities. However,
considering the lack of best practices related to technique, VAD adjustments,
anticoagulation, and postoperative management of patients implanted with
intracorporeal biventricular support devices, it is possible that many of these
complications could be prevented<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In our service, temporary ventricle support is performed by inserting pulmonary
artery cannulation through the right jugular vein using a flexible wire-reinforced
single-stage 17 Fr cannula. Venous drainage is performed using a multiple-stage 25
Fr cannula introduced through the right femoral artery into the RA. Flow can reach
up to 5 L/min by connecting the cannula to a centrifugal pump (Centrimag or Sorin).
A similar technique has been described<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> with arterial pulmonary cannulation through the femoral
vein.</p><p>Recently, the Impella RP was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for
temporary percutaneous RV support. This device is implanted through the right
femoral vein and is fluoroscopically guided into the pulmonary trunk. Its maximum
motor speed generates flows up to 5 L/min. The authors' experience with the Impella
RP has been limited, but it has yielded very good outcomes.</p><p>However, if the RV function is not recovered after some weeks of temporary support,
the implantation of long-term intracorporeal mechanical circulatory support is
indicated<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Currently, there are no long-term intracorporeal devices specifically designed to
provide RV support.</p><p>The implantation of a left mechanical circulatory support device to assist a failing
RV has been performed successfully at some centers. Most of the implantations are
performed using personal technical modifications required to adjust to physiological
and anatomical differences in right-side circulation. HeartWare is the most commonly
used device for RV support<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The surgical technique consists of implanting the HeartWare inflow cannula through
the free wall of the RA or the diaphragmatic surface of the RV. Since the length of
the inflow cannula is designed for the left ventricle, anatomical differences in the
right chambers require changes to the surgical technique to prevent inflow cannula
obstruction. The depth of the inflow cannula must be adjusted by adding hand-made
felt rings underneath the anchoring ring.</p><p>Implantations in the RA tend to be easier, because resecting the tricuspid valve is
not necessary. The pump is positioned in the right pleural space with the inflow
cannula tunneling through the pericardium and the wall of the RA. Positioning the
pump in the pleural space prevents compressing the RA, which occurs when the pump is
placed on the pericardial sac.</p><p>Implantation of mechanical circulatory assist devices in the RV requires caution
regarding resection of the tricuspid valve and subvalvular apparatus, and placement
of any stimulation or defibrillator leads. Otherwise, the risk of inflow
obstruction, thrombus ingestion and pump thrombosis increases.</p><p>The outflow graft is anastomosed to the pulmonary trunk. However, due to decreased
vascular resistance on the right side of the heart, the mechanical circulatory
support device can produce excessive flow into the pulmonary system. To avoid
pulmonary congestion, the HeartWare device must be adjusted to a slower speed (rpm).
Another option is to restrict the outflow graft, reducing its luminal diameter. This
can be done by suturing a smaller graft end to the HeartWare graft or attaching
vascular clips, as described in a previous study<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. Little is known about the extent of graft restriction or
the ideal speed of HeartWare device to overcome decreased vascular resistance. Both
techniques can lead to increased thrombogenicity in comparison with left-side
implants, especially when implants are placed on the diaphragmatic surface of the
RV<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The authors' first experiences with implantation on the RV diaphragmatic surface
resulted in pump thrombosis in two out of five patients. A similar experience was
described in a recently published study, in which 13 patients with dilated
cardiomyopathy and severe biventricular failure were implanted with HeartWare
devices. Mechanical circulatory support device thrombosis took place in three out of
six patients with implants in the RV, in contrast with only one out of seven
patients with devices implanted in the RA.</p><p>The cases described in the present study illustrate the complexity of clinical
decisions when treating right heart failure. Given the absence of circulatory assist
devices developed and approved for right-side support, when faced with patients with
biventricular dysfunction, surgeons tend to adopt alternative techniques whose
effectiveness has not yet been proven. Modifications to LVAD and technical
alterations to adapt them to the anatomical and physiological characteristics of
right-side circulation can lead to serious consequences for the success of clinical
treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Implantation of devices in the RA could present advantages when compared to
implantation in the RV. The required surgical technique is easier, it preserves the
tricuspid valve and can potentially reduce the risk of pump thrombosis. Little is
known about the best pump speed and afterload reduction to establish adequate flow
for correct circulation.</p><p>Companies involved in developing and manufacturing mechanical circulatory support
devices should be encouraged to invest in the development of systems specifically
designed to provide long-term support to the RV.</p><p>This communication underscores the benefits of this life-saving therapy, when
clinically indicated.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="10%" span="1"/><col width="90%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th colspan="2" align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026;

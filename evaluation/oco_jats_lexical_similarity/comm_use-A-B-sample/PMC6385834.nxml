involvement. Only 10% of these become symptomatic. Considering the long time
interval between the start of infestation and symptoms to occur, it is hard to
diagnose cystic echinococcosis. When detected, even if it is asymptomatic,
intramyocardial hydatid cyst requires surgical intervention due to risks of
spontaneous rupture and anaphylaxis. In literature, no case of hydatid cyst
located in the coronary arterial wall has been reported. Twenty-two-year-old
male patient with previous history of pulmonary cystic echinococcosis was
referred to us with typical symptoms of coronary artery disease. Coronary
cineangiography revealed proximal left diagonal artery (LAD) occlusion.
Pre-operative transthoracic echocardiography of the patient planned to undergo
coronary artery bypass grafting unveiled an intracoronary calcified cystic mass.
In operation, the calcified cystic mass with well-defined borders and size of
2x2 cm located within wall of proximal segment of the LAD artery was excised and
double bypass with left internal thoracic artery (LITA) and great saphenous vein
grafts to the LAD and first diagonal arteries, respectively, was done.
Pathological analysis of the mass revealed it to be an inactive calcified
hydatid cyst. Echinococcal IgG-ELISA test was positive. 12-week oral albendazole
treatment (2x400 mg/day) was launched postoperatively and the patient was
discharged on 7<sup>th</sup> postoperative day.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Albendazole</kwd><kwd>Parasitology</kwd><kwd>Echinococcosis</kwd><kwd>Heart Disease</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><table-wrap id="t1" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="10%" span="1"/><col width="90%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" style="background-color:#e6e7e8" rowspan="1">Abbreviations,

hydatid cyst. The incidence of concomitant liver and lung hydatidosis varies from
5.8 to 13.3%<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. These cysts grow at a rate of roughly 1 cm per
year, and become symptomatic within 5 to 10 years<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Parasitic larvae
migrate to heart mainly via coronary circulation. Frequency of cardiac hydatidosis
vary from 0.5 to 2%<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. The embryo reaches full growth at 1 to 5 years
after being lodged in the heart. The myocardial reaction to the cyst creates an
adventitial pericyst layer<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. We aimed to present a rarely-seen location and thus
complication, namely the coronary artery disease, of cardiac hydatidosis to
attention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>CASE REPORT</title><p>A 22-year old male patient was referred to our clinic with exertional angina. His
history revealed pulmonary hydatidosis treated through cystectomy and capitonnage
followed by 12-week oral albendazole treatment (400 mg/twice a day) five years ago.
Chest X-ray and thoracic computed tomography (CT) exposed only few scattered
calcifications within pulmonary parenchyma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure
1</xref>). Cineangiography of the patient with ST segment depression in exercise
test revealed that the left diagonal artery (LAD) and 1<sup>st</sup> diagonal
arteries were proximally occluded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>).
In transthoracic echocardiography, a cystic mass of 2x2 cm with well-defined borders
was detected on the left ventricular anterior wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). The patient was taken into operation for coronary artery
bypass grafting. Operation was carried out under cardiopulmonary bypass instituted
after median sternotomy. The mass, with size of 2x2 cm and regular borders, was
found to be located between the left main and LAD coronary arteries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). Since calcified, the cyst was isolated
<italic>en bloc</italic> with the coronary artery segments it had infiltrated
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). Free ends of the coronary
arteries opening into the cavity left behind after cyst excision were ligated.
Capitonnage was performed after irrigation with hypertonic saline solution.
Following that, LAD artery and 1<sup>st</sup> diagonal artery were bypassed.
Macroscopically, it was detected that the cyst contains clear colorless fluid (eau
de rock). Microbiological and pathological analysis of both the cyst and its
ingredients revealed findings consistent with the hydatid cyst. Echinococcal
IgG-ELISA test was found to be positive (sensitivity: 94%, specificity:
99%)<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.
The patient received oral albendazole treatment (10 mg/kg/day; 2x400 mg/day)
postoperatively for 12 weeks. During 1-year follow-up, diagnostic tests were
negative and no recurrence was observed.</p><p><fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Echocardiographic view of the hydatid cyst. LV=left ventricle; RV=right

circulatory network, followed, in decreasing incidence, by right ventricle (15%),
interventricular septum (9%), left atrium (8%), pericardium (7%), pulmonary artery
(6-7%), right atrium (4%), and interatrial septum (2%)<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. However, to date, no
coronary arterial involvement of hydatid cyst causing coronary artery occlusion has
been reported.</p><p>Though coughing, palpitation and angina could be the symptoms, only 10% of the
cardiac hydatidosis cases become symptomatic<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>. In symptomatic cases, since potential
cyst rupture could end up with anaphylaxis, early surgical intervention is
recommended<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. Ben-Hamda et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> reported that
hydatidosis, particularly in elderly patients, could mimic angina and myocardial
infarction as a result of compression to adjacent tissues. In younger patients,
symptoms may comprise rather of dyspnea, coughing, loss of weight, and
fever<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.
Though the case we present is young, he presented symptoms typical of elders.
Rupture into cardiac chambers may cause ventricular outflow tract obstruction, low
cardiac output syndrome, pulmonary, cerebral or peripheral emboli and hypertension.
In case of conduction system involvement, rhythm problems can
occur<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. Moreover, as in our case, referral with coronary
artery disease related symptoms is possible, too. Q and inverted T waves seen in ECG
can be helpful in diagnosis. Echocardiography is an effective tool in diagnosis of
cardiac hydatidosis. CT and magnetic resonance imaging are effective, particularly
in diagnosis of extracardiac hydatidosis. In the case we present, intracoronary
calcified inactive cyst is thought to be originated from embolization of ruptured
pulmonary hydatid cyst since his history reveals previous pulmonary involvement. It
is postulated that, as a result of either previous medical treatment or spontaneous
cyst inactivation, the cystic growth was impeded, and the cyst was calcified.
Therefore, the cyst was easily enucleated. When findings suggestive of cardiac
involvement are present, particularly in endemic areas (Mediterranean coasts, Middle
East, Australia, South America), cardiac hydatidosis must be
considered<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Surgical intervention is the first-line treatment since medical therapy is
insufficient in preventing the rupture of the cyst<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. As in the case we
present, coronary complication of pulmonary hydatidosis could be seen even 5 years
after the treatment. Some surgeons proposed perioperative sterilization of the
cystic location with either 2% formalin or 20% hypertonic saline
solution<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. The cyst in our case was easily isolated <italic>en
bloc</italic> with coronary artery segments it infiltrated without any rupture.
Free ends of the coronary arteries opening into the cavity left behind after cyst
excision were ligated. Capitonnage was performed after irrigation with hypertonic
saline solution. Following that, LAD artery and 1<sup>st</sup> diagonal artery were
bypassed.</p><p>Definitive diagnosis and assessment of cystic activity are done through cyst
serology. Though echinococcal IgG-ELISA test is sensitive, the treatment strategy
must not be directed by cyst serology. This is due to the fact that serology could
be negative while hydatid cyst infestation is present or be positive for years while
a treated and inactive cyst is present<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. For this reason, considering all
possibilities, oral albendazole treatment (10 mg/kg/day; 2x400 mg/day)
postoperatively for 12 weeks was administered.</p><p>In young cases of hydatidosis, since clinical presentations resemble those of other
conditions, without further studies it is hard to trace angina to cardiac
involvement rather than pulmonary hydatidosis. Particularly in regions where
hydatidosis is endemic, in differential diagnosis of young patients with coronary
artery disease of unknown origin, cardiac hydatidosis must be considered. Moreover,
while surgical intervention and medical therapy are planned for pulmonary
hydatidosis, possibility of concomitant organ involvement must not be passed
over.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="5%" span="1"/><col width="95%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">UV</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Substantial contributions to the

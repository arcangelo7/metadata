The interest is also propelled by the poor or erratic oral absorption, presystemic elimination, serious side effects, and/or frequent dosing associated with the vast majority of active pharmaceutical ingredients. As alternative route of administration, the skin provides an opportunity for mitigating the aforesaid issues.</p><p id="Par4">The premise of delivering difficult actives by the dermal route however is weighed down by the formidable barrier function properties of the stratum corneum. Short of physically disrupting the skin by physical means (<italic>e.g.</italic>, microneedles), scientists may use formulation approaches that optimize drug/vehicle properties and enable the drug&#x02019;s penetration and subsequent crossing of the stratum corneum. Designing prodrugs, increasing thermodynamic driving force, ion-pairing to decrease drug charge, eutectic blends, complexation, and complex formulations (such as liposomes, vesicles, nanoparticles) are examples of formulation approaches that have shown to improve the dermal/transdermal delivery of drugs.</p><p id="Par5">A widely practiced formulation option is to use a specific vehicle consisting of an &#x0201c;enhancer&#x0201d; in which the drug is dissolved or dispersed for the purpose of reducing skin&#x02019;s barrier properties and/or enhancing the quantity/rate of the drug transfer across the stratum corneum. Ideally, the selected enhancer will, alone or in combination with other formulation components, reduce the barrier function of the stratum corneum; facilitate the solubilization of the active in the stratum corneum; and contribute to the active&#x02019;s subsequent partitioning and diffusion through the stratum corneum. Skin hydration, intercellular lipid disorganization and/or disruption, and restructuring of intracellular keratin are among the mechanisms by which enhancers could exert their role, ideally with minimal lasting impact on the integrity of the skin. A long list of excipients has emerged from decades of scientific search for the ideal vehicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>). Examples of chemical enhancers by functional category are provided in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">I</xref>.

The nonclinical data along with a long history of use as vehicle and solvent by various routes of administration provide evidence for its safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>).

There are no limits set for inactive ingredients&#x02019; use level in over-the-counter products, so long as the usage complies with Good Manufacturing Practices in the USA. In Japan, Transcutol is permitted for use in quasi-drug products including personal care (hair, skin) and oral preparations.

Its physical and chemical properties are comparable to protic solvents like ethanol (EtOH), propylene glycol (PG), and water. The viscosity, density, and Log <italic>P</italic> properties of Transcutol approach those of water but the vapor pressure and boiling point accost those of PG (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">II</xref>). Other properties like surface tension and melting point of Transcutol fall somewhere between those of EtOH and water. The relatively low vapor pressure and high boiling point of Transcutol are advantages over EtOH and water which cannot be processed at high temperatures. Transcutol is chemically stable in neutral and alkali pH, with optimal formulation range of pH&#x000a0;4 to 9. The pH of a 10% Transcutol solution is near neutral (6.6).</p><p id="Par11">An important property of Transcutol is its capacity to dissolve a broad range of hydrophilic and lipophilic actives. Its ability to outperform PG and EtOH in solubilization power makes it a highly useful pharmaceutical excipient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>). With a negative log <italic>P</italic> of ~&#x02009;0.5, Transcutol is considered as a polar protic solubilizer that demonstrates affinity and good miscibility with also hydrophobic groups. The ability of solvents having a negative log <italic>P</italic> to readily penetrate the stratum corneum contrasts with lipophilic actives (log <italic>P</italic> values of 2&#x02013;3) more readily penetrating the stratum corneum than actives having negative log <italic>P</italic> values. Note that all the solvents listed in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">II</xref> have negative log <italic>P</italic> values. Dimethyl sulfoxide, generally regarded as the most skin permeable solvent, has a log <italic>P</italic> value of &#x02212;&#x02009;1.35. Thus, the expectations for skin penetration for pharmaceutical actives characterized by molecular weights of over 200 and functional groups that carry charge are not necessarily applicable to solvents that cannot be ionized and have molecular weights around 100.</p><p id="Par13">Transcutol is compatible with most pharmaceutical excipients; soluble in common solvents like glycerin, EtOH, PG, and water; miscible with polar lipids like medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) based surfactants (polyoxylglycerides); but insoluble in non-polar mineral oil or dimethicone. Owing to its high solubility and miscibility with water, Transcutol may hydrate depending on the relative humidity conditions (RH). The hydration kinetics of Transcutol were observed by Ganem-Quintanar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>) who reported a moisture gain of 6% at 98% RH and a moisture loss of ~&#x02009;1% at 50% RH conditions.

Combining impedance spectroscopy with polarization transfer solid-state NMR techniques, the authors demonstrated that increased hydration leads to mobilization of the non-aqueous stratum corneum components, increased solubility, and reduced diffusional resistance toward permeants (drugs, excipients) in a formulation. In this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>), the flow-through cell was loaded with hydrated dermatomed pig skin (approximately 0.5&#x000a0;mm), dosed at 3145&#x000a0;mg/cm<sup>2</sup> for 24&#x000a0;h. The flux of Transcutol across hydrated pig ear skin increased with increasing concentration of Transcutol in the donor solution.

The molecular mobility of the stratum corneum protein or lipid components in the presence of Transcutol resembled those of PBS soaked skin more than the molecular rigid stratum corneum at 93% RH. The study also found that increasing concentrations of Transcutol (up to 30%) lowered the water activity of the stratum corneum (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), imposing dehydrating conditions while retaining the high skin permeability of a hydrated stratum corneum at reduced hydration conditions.

In aqueous formulations on the other hand, Transcutol is likely trailing the abundance of water, thus permeating at a faster rate.

For Fick&#x02019;s laws to rigorously hold, several conditions must be met including (1) the donor solution is inert with regard to the permeability of the membrane and (2) that a concentration gradient does not develop within the donor solution (usually satisfied by the donor solution being applied as an infinite dose). At saturation, the driving force is unity, and since supersaturation can raise the driving force to significantly above unity, formulating at the same fraction of active solubility (say 1% of saturation) in two different donor solutions will provide the same thermodynamic drug activity.</p><p id="Par25">Transcutol, a solvent that can increase drug solubility by orders of magnitude compared to other topically applied pharmaceutical solvents, can have a dramatic influence on thermodynamic driving force. If thermodynamic activity is not considered, it may appear that Transcutol retards rather than enhances skin penetration.

Since the Transcutol solution was dosed at 3.7% of its saturated thermodynamic activity compared to buffer or IPM dosed at 100% of the thermodynamic activity, conclusions concerning the ability of Transcutol to either enhance or retard skin penetration cannot be made based on the data set presented.

From a practical product development point of view, a formulator never develops a topical product at saturation due to the likelihood that the active will precipitate during temperature excursions.

A 1936 thermodynamic description of solubility by Hildebrand, later refined by Hansen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>) assigned a numerical value called the solubility parameter, to each solvent and solute based upon their cohesive energy density. The solubility parameter of the skin is influenced by the relatively high hydrogen bonding of the water molecules and the tight packing of the intercellular lipids in the stratum corneum. The energy required to separate a permeant (drug) from its solvent (enhancer), <italic>i.e.</italic>, partitioning of the drug into the stratum corneum may be facilitated by a differential in solubility parameters between skin, drug, and enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>). More specifically, low molecular weight solvents such as Transcutol can readily permeate the intercellular spaces and lower the solubility parameter of the intercellular lipid domains to better match the solubility parameter value typical of pharmaceutical actives. This in turn increases the solubility of the permeant (active) in the stratum corneum. Others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>) have shown that Transcutol enhances a permeant&#x02019;s solubility in the skin without significantly influencing the diffusivity of the permeant in the skin/stratum corneum Osborne (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>). Using electron microscopy, Ritschel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>) showed that Transcutol is able to significantly contribute to the swelling of the intercellular spaces of the stratum corneum. This unique ability to swell the intercellular path of the skin&#x02019;s barrier gives rise to both skin retention (the intracutaneous skin depot) and skin penetration enhancement, which may seem mechanistically contradictory unless the molecular structure of the active is taken into consideration.</p><p id="Par31">Keep in mind that the phrase &#x0201c;altering the solubility parameter of the intercellular lipid domain&#x0201d; is just one way of articulating that Transcutol, while present in the stratum corneum, dramatically changes how a drug will partition into the skin from the topical product residing on the skin surface. As described, in an infinite dose, steady-state flux IVPT experiment, Transcutol promptly partitions into the stratum corneum and saturates the intercellular lipid domain. This allows greater amounts of drug to partition into the stratum corneum. The ability of the drug to partition out of the stratum corneum and into the viable epidermis is dependent upon the physical chemical properties, <italic>i.e.</italic>, molecular structure, of the drug. If the drug readily partitions out of the stratum corneum, then increased partitioning into the skin due to the presence of Transcutol results in increased skin permeation. Drugs that do not carry a charge at the physiological pH value of the epidermis and have an octanol-water partition coefficient above 3.0 are likely to have decreased partitioning out of the stratum corneum. For these actives an enhanced penetration due to the presence of Transcutol results in increased concentration and retention of the drug in the stratum corneum. As expressed, a topically applied solvent that increases drug solubility in the stratum corneum will be a skin penetration enhancer only if the active readily partitions out of the stratum corneum due to good solubility of the active in the viable epidermis. This description is most relevant to IVPT studies applying an infinite dose of the test article. When applying a clinically relevant dose that can undergo drug product metamorphosis, this description is often an oversimplification. Note that this conceptual description also ignores any penetration that might occur by a shunt pathway, <italic>i.e.</italic>, the pilosebaceous unit. In general, the large enhancement ratios published from infinite dose single application <italic>in vitro</italic> studies rarely translate into multi-fold enhancement when finite doses of the same product are administered in the clinic over a full treatment cycle. However, the ranking of &#x0201c;most bioavailable&#x0201d; formulation to &#x0201c;least bioavailable&#x0201d; formulation usually holds for IVPT compared to clinical results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Enhancing Penetration by Maintaining Hydrated Dynamics in the Stratum Corneum</title><p id="Par32">Hydration of the skin can enhance skin penetration for both hydrophilic and lipophilic permeants.

It is important to emphasize that water is constantly back diffusing from the viable epidermis out through the stratum corneum to evaporate in the air (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>). This phenomenon is labeled as insensible perspiration or trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL). Depending on levels of ambient humidity, at equilibrium, the water content of the stratum corneum is normally around 15&#x02013;20% of the dried weight of this outermost layer of the skin.

Once Transcutol permeates the stratum corneum, the molecular mobility of the stratum corneum protein or lipid components is more similar to PBS soaked skin than the molecular rigid stratum corneum at 93% RH. It was further proposed by Bjorklund that Transcutol has similar physicochemical properties as urea, glycerol, or other natural moisturizing factors and may influence molecular dynamics of the stratum corneum in a similar manner. Although we think of Transcutol as an excellent solvent for lipids, it must be noted that Transcutol is uniquely hygroscopic.</p><p id="Par34">It is therefore postulated that the ability of Transcutol to readily penetrate the stratum corneum and strongly interact with the water of the intercellular path is what makes Transcutol unique when compared to other solvents that modify skin permeation.

Lipid disruption can be shown by DSC to measure the phase transition temperature of the intercellular lipids or by FTIR spectroscopy to measure rotational bands linked to the intercellular lipids. Earlier publications utilizing these techniques to study Transcutol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>) did not find Transcutol alone to disrupt the epidermal lipid structure or the structural integrity of the skin. In a comparative study of a dozen solubilizers and penetration enhancing excipients including fatty acids, Gwak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>) concluded that Transcutol merely eases the partition of the active by increasing its solubility in the skin which then leads to improved drug partitioning in the skin. Salimi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>) using DSC and FTIR evaluated the effectiveness of different vehicles on meloxicam permeability and microstructure of intercellular lipids in the stratum corneum layer of skin. The results showed drug diffusion to be the rate-limiting step for the permeability (flux) of meloxicam into the full rat skin. Among the enhancers studied, Transcutol was the most effective, increasing flux 21 times and diffusion coefficient 17 times compared to hydrated skin. The principal mode of action of Transcutol enhancement activity was attributed to the facilitation of drug partitioning and diffusion into skin. A thorough mechanism of percutaneous penetration enhancement study of Transcutol was published by Harrison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>). Using 4-cyanophenol as the skin permeant, the diffusivity and solubility of this molecule in human stratum corneum was followed using attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and Franz-type diffusion cell flux measurements of the permeant. These methodologies were performed on skin dosed with a mixture of Transcutol and water (1:1 ratio) saturated with 4-cyanophenol. The 50:50 TRC/W blend increased the flux of 4-cyanophenol across human skin <italic>in vitro</italic> by a factor of approximately two compared to a saturated water control.

Applying small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering techniques, Moghadam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>) examined the effect of various penetration enhancers on the structural changes and hydrocarbon chain packing of the human stratum corneum lipids. As expected, the highest degree of stratum corneum lipid disordering was caused by surfactants and terpenes. The skin samples pretreated with neat solvents (EtOH and PG) were unaffected. As for Transcutol, it was not tested neat nor diluted with water, but rather at 10% in PG for which a slight disordering effect within the stratum corneum was reported.

The described effect was limited to the relatively polar regions of the stratum corneum, notably the ceramide head groups of lipid lamellae. Increased mobility in the ceramide head groups indicates that Transcutol can preferentially partition into more polar environments and disturb the packing in the interfacial head group layer of intracellular lipids. This slight disturbance was similar in scale to that observed with neat PBS. This implies that Transcutol can disturb the lipid packing by preferentially partitioning in the more polar regions of the stratum corneum.</p><p id="Par38">Other studies have shown that when Transcutol is combined with enhancers known to disrupt epidermal lipid structure such as azone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>), significant skin penetration enhancement occurs. It should be noted that fluidization of the intercellular lipid domain should always cause an increase in permeability coefficient and decrease in lag time.

For each salt studied, the overall permeability was due to the partial contribution of each species, <italic>i.e.</italic>, diclofenac anion, ion pairs, and acidic diclofenac. It was shown that for the saturated water systems, the diethylamine and epolamine salts form ion pairs that have a greater ability to partition into the stratum corneum compared to diclofenac sodium or diclofenac potassium. When dissolved in Transcutol, Minghetti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>) used the solvent effect to explain that Transcutol results in ion pair formation, greater partitioning of the neutralized diclofenac salt into lipid domains of the horny layer, and ultimate dissociation of the ion pairs when diclofenac reaches the aqueous viable epidermis. The researchers did not discuss that flux of the diclofenac salts from Transcutol ranged from 1/100 to 2/3 of the flux values from saturated water. When viewed in light of the Bjorklund (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>) study, it would appear that enhanced penetration resulting from a decrease in ionized diclofenac (solvent effect from using neat Transcutol) is overwhelmed by stiffening of the intercellular domain (increased skin barrier) due to stratum corneum dehydration that occurs when dosing with neat Transcutol.</p><p id="Par41">Gwak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>) used IVPT to determine skin flux values and permeability coefficients from saturated solutions of Transcutol and water. Hairless mouse skin was mounted on a side-by-side diffusion cell. As seen in Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">IV</xref>, ondansetron HCl aqueous saturation concentration of 36&#x000a0;mg/ml was about twice the amount of active found to be soluble in Transcutol. It should be noted that ondansetron is a weak base (pKa&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.4) that is ionized under acidic conditions. The natural pH of ondansetron HCl solutions is about 4.5 to 4.6 and the solubility is significantly reduced in solutions at, or above, pH equal to 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>). Since the calculated (ALOGPS) aqueous solubility of ondansetron HCl is 0.248&#x000a0;mg/ml, it can be assumed that the active in the donor compartment of the side-by-side cell was completely ionized. The Gwak study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>) showed that the flux of ondansetron from neat Transcutol was an order of magnitude lower than from a saturated aqueous solution. Likewise, the apparent permeability coefficient of ondansetron delivered from water was 13.4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>&#x000a0;cm/s compared to 1.21&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>&#x000a0;cm/s when delivered from neat Transcutol. Since the saturated solutions are at equivalent driving force, any solvent effect benefit from formulating ondansetron in neat Transcutol is overwhelmed by the stratum corneum dehydrating effect of neat Transcutol. Also, since the solubility is dramatically reduced at pH values above 6, ondansetron will not readily partition out of the stratum corneum into the viable epidermis which is at physiological pH.</p><p id="Par42">Bonina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>) studied two model drugs having vastly different physical properties, caffeine and testosterone. Saturated solutions of caffeine and testosterone from seven neat solvents and a blend of PG and propylene glycol dipelargonate (DPPG) were applied to human skin loaded onto Franz cells. The flux values for both model drugs were slightly less from neat Transcutol than from water (ER&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.88) potentially due to the dehydrating effect of neat Transcutol. One might speculate that the infinite dose of 133&#x000a0;mg donor solution/cm<sup>2</sup> of skin may be less capable of dehydrating the skin over 24&#x000a0;h than the 1752 or 4688&#x000a0;mg/cm<sup>2</sup> of neat Transcutol listed in Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">IV</xref>.</p><p id="Par43">Bayldon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>) investigated the effects of vehicles on the retention and permeation of lidocaine free base after application to sheep skin. The purpose of this study was to determine feasibility of a topical anesthetic veterinary product for use prior to minor surgical procedures. 88.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l/cm<sup>2</sup> of lidocaine free base saturated solutions were dosed using Franz cells maintained at 32&#x000b0;C with PBS as the receptor solution. The authors emphasize that the clipped felt of sheep skin (the tissue loaded in the Franz cell for this study) had a continuous coat of an emulsion consisting of sweat and sebum. Sheep skin has dramatically more follicles than human skin, with Merino sheep having up to 10,000 follicles per cm<sup>2</sup>. The study found that non-aqueous (neat) vehicles (100% DMSO, 100% Transcutol, 100% IPM) enhanced penetration of lidocaine free base compared to the aqueous vehicles (0.5% or 1% sodium lauryl sulphate, 50% dimethyl sulfoxide, 50% Transcutol, or 100% water). A saturated solution dose of approximately 88.5&#x000a0;mg/cm<sup>2</sup> is considered an infinite dose based upon FDA&#x02019;s guidance that a finite IVPT dose should be 3&#x02013;5&#x000a0;mg/cm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>). However, this quantity of Transcutol applied to sheep felt that has been processed to assure retention of a layer of sebum/sweat emulsion appears incapable of dehydrating the stratum corneum during IVPT. Thus, for topical application to sheep, the use of neat Transcutol in a clinically relevant dose of 88.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l/cm<sup>2</sup> will enhance the skin transport of lidocaine.</p><p id="Par44">In an IVPT study published by Gwak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>), the authors emphasized that the permeation fluxes of tenoxicam from saturated solutions in various vehicles were generally low (0.1&#x02013;1.1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/cm<sup>2</sup>&#x000a0;h) and no individual vehicle possessed the necessary intrinsic activity to dramatically promote permeation. Upon closer examination of the reported permeation rates for water (0.15&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.04&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g&#x000a0;tenoxicam/cm<sup>2</sup>&#x000a0;h) and neat Transcutol (1.13&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.42&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g&#x000a0;tenoxicam/cm<sup>2</sup>&#x000a0;h), it is evident that the latter produced 7.5 times more tenoxicam compared to the saturated water (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">IV</xref>). This high ER for tenoxicam delivered from Transcutol could be explained by the inherently high variability in flux measurements of poorly permeating actives, or it could be an example of enhancement due to the solvent effect overwhelming the increased barrier resulting from neat Transcutol dehydrating the stratum corneum. Tenoxicam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>) has the most complex acid-base properties of the drugs considered in this review. At pH values below the pK<sub>a1</sub> (4.3), tenoxicam carries a positive charge. At pH values above pK<sub>a2</sub> (5.3), tenoxicam carries a negative charge and approaches 5&#x000a0;mg/ml solubility at the physiological pH of the viable epidermis. Based on this acid-base chemistry, neutral tenoxicam dissolved in Transcutol at 4.7&#x000a0;mg/ml should readily partition into the pH&#x02009;=&#x02009;5 stratum corneum and just as readily partition out of the stratum corneum into the viable epidermis.</p><p id="Par45">A consistent mechanistic picture of how during IVPT experiments neat Transcutol modifies the stratum corneum can be derived from the publications reviewed. If a true infinite dose (in excess of 1&#x000a0;ml/cm<sup>2</sup> skin surface area) of neat Transcutol is added to the donor compartment for IVPT, then the stratum corneum dehydrates, stiffening the intercellular lipids and increasing the barrier of the skin. Simultaneously, Transcutol quickly permeates the stratum corneum potentially decreasing the barrier of the skin by decreasing drug charge (solvent effect), increasing the solubility of the active in the stratum corneum, and/or disorganizing the crystalline epidermal lipid structure. Based on the data summarized in Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">IV</xref>, it is highly likely that the dehydration effect of dosing with neat Transcutol may dominate the competing penetration enhancing effects of dosing with neat Transcutol. This results in saturated water having higher skin flux values than saturated Transcutol.</p><p id="Par46">It should be noted that the decrease in skin flux seen in these publications from neat Transcutol (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">IV</xref>) is an infinite dose IVPT artifact rather than a significant insight for developing a commercial topical product. In practice, when applied <italic>in vivo</italic>, 1&#x000a0;ml of a topical product will spread over 300&#x000a0;cm<sup>2</sup> of skin surface area. This thin film of Transcutol will be present on the skin&#x02019;s surface for less than a minute and will not be able to dehydrate the entire thickness of the stratum corneum. Thus, this mechanistic insight should be used to facilitate interpretation of steady-state IVPT data rather than guide formulation development.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Effect of Transcutol Binary Solvent Blends on Drug Penetration/Permeation</title><p id="Par47">With this understanding of how Transcutol partitions into the lipid filled intercellular spaces of the stratum corneum to retain the high skin permeability of a hydrated stratum corneum at reduced hydration conditions, it becomes apparent that blending Transcutol with molecules having complimentary mechanisms for disrupting epidermal lipid structure could result in synergistic skin penetration enhancement. This combined with Transcutol potentially reducing the charge of certain actives and increasing solubility and/or partition of some drugs into the stratum corneum results in optimized Transcutol blends consistently obtaining the highest enhancement ratios based on IVPT. Studies combining Transcutol with MCT, PG, PGML, PGMC, OA, IPM, propylene glycol laurate (PGL), or sucrose esters including sucrose myristate (SM), sucrose oleate (SO), and sucrose laurate (SL) have shown that Transcutol blends can dramatically increase the skin flux of certain pharmaceutical active ingredients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>).

In Yazdanian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>), the authors were developing a veterinary topical ivermectin product for cattle. As part of the study they prepared ivermectin solutions (14&#x000a0;mg/ml) in Miglyol 812 (MCT) and Transcutol blends of 90/10, 70/30, 50/50, and 0/100 (neat Transcutol). They traced tritiated ivermectin as it crossed excised bovine skin (Hostein, dermatomed to 4.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.2&#x000a0;mm) and measured the appearance of Transcutol in the receptor solution (gas chromatography). The distribution profiles of ivermectin as a function of skin depth and solvent composition are summarized in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">15</xref>a. As shown, the amount of ivermectin present in the skin was significantly greater, with most of the ivermectin localized in the upper layers of the skin. The authors reported that ivermectin permeation was accompanied by the formation of cutaneous depots of ivermectin; that partitioning of ivermectin into the skin was far greater in the presence of Transcutol in saturated solutions; that ivermectin &#x0201c;was permeating with Transcutol, in which it is very soluble.&#x0201d; It was also noted that there were no significant statistical differences in the flux of Transcutol as the concentration of Transcutol in the donor phase was increased. This was in contrast to what was expected on the basis of thermodynamic activity. A closer examination of the data (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">15</xref>b, c), however, reveals that overall, ivermectin solubility as well as skin permeation parameters (flux and Kp) increased significantly with the increasing concentration of Transcutol. Since this IVPT study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>) was completed in support of a veterinary product, it is important to note that the Franz cell study (dosed at 282&#x000a0;mg/cm<sup>2</sup> using a receptor solution of 25% glycerol in water) held the skin temperature at 39&#x000b0;C to match the skin temperature of living cattle. No quantitative correlation between bovine and human skin transport should be inferred from this study; however, the observation of how flux and permeability coefficient trend with increasing Transcutol concentration is noteworthy.<fig id="Fig15"><label>Fig. 15</label><caption><p><bold>a</bold> The distribution of ivermectin in bovine skin after topical application of ivermectin solutions (14&#x000a0;mg/ml) for 66&#x000a0;h <italic>in vitro</italic>. <bold>b</bold> Effect of solvent composition on the solubility and permeation rate of ivermectin across bovine skin. <bold>c</bold> Partition coefficient of ivermectin solutions (14&#x000a0;mg/ml) in Transcutol and MCT (medium-chain triglyceride) binary mixtures.

They mounted hairless mouse abdominal skin on a diffusion cell, dosed at 394&#x000a0;mg/cm<sup>2</sup>, and followed skin permeation for 96&#x000a0;h. In general, solubility for both the free base and hydrochloride salt of morphine increased with increasing Transcutol concentrations, with morphine HCl being about 60-fold less soluble in the formulations than the free base (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">16</xref>a). The morphine flux values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>) were very similar to those reported by Yazdanian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>) for ivermectin.

The flux of both actives from neat Transcutol dramatically decreased, likely due to neat Transcutol dehydrating the stratum corneum and increasing the barrier properties of the skin. Since all of the formulations were at equivalent, maximum thermodynamic driving force, the marked difference in the flux values between the morphine free base and the morphine HCL may be attributed to the lower permeability of the latter, <italic>i.e.</italic>, the HCL salt being in ionized form. Noteworthy is the proximity of the nearly equal flux values at 50:50 TRC/LABH for both species of the morphine, indicating the possibility of a solvent effect being responsible for reducing the morphine HCl charge.<fig id="Fig16"><label>Fig. 16</label><caption><p><bold>a</bold> Morphine solubility in binary blends of Transcutol and Labrafac (LABH). <bold>b</bold> Morphine flux from binary blends of Transcutol and LABH.

It should be noted that the relative bioavailability enhancement factor calculated by these researchers is very different than the simple ER values used throughout this review. The researchers also studied the test article application sites using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy.

Koprda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>) studied permeation in the rat skin of dicarbine (stobadine HCl) from TRC/W solutions at 1:1 and 2:1 ratio, with and without azone. The results summarized in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig17" ref-type="fig">17</xref> show that drug permeation increased with the addition of 1% and 5% azone and that the drug permeation was effectively higher from the 50:50 (TRC/W) than with the 66:33 (TRC/W) mixture, even if 1% azone was added. However, addition of 5% azone to the 2:1 TRC/W combination increased the flux dramatically by 16 times. The enhancing effect of azone has been attributed to direct interactions with the stratum corneum lipids and lowering their melt transition temperature, thus creating a more fluid environment amenable to permeant diffusion. The ability of Transcutol to preferentially partition into more polar environments and disturb the packing in the interfacial head group layer of the intercellular lipids works synergistically with azone&#x02019;s ability to melt the natural orthorhombic structure of the hydrocarbon chain packing of the intercellular lipids. This synergism between Transcutol and azone appears to be greatest at a specific ratio of Transcutol, water and azone. In addition to Transcutol facilitating azone fluidizing of the intercellular lipids, Transcutol is likely enhancing the solubility of dicarbine in the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>).<fig id="Fig17"><label>Fig. 17</label><caption><p>Permeation enhancement ratios for dicarbine (stobadine HCl) across rat skin from Transcutol/water combinations with 1% and 5% azone.

the frequently cited 1991 publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>), a 0.09% hydrocortisone gel consisting of 50% Transcutol, 12.00% PG, 10.00% Cab-O-Sil, and triethanolamine buffer pH&#x000a0;8.0 q.s. ad to 100% was prepared. Sprague-Dawley rats were dosed daily by applying 1&#x000a0;g of gel into a flexible Teflon ring (4.24&#x000a0;cm<sup>2</sup>). The dosing area was then closed with a polyethylene membrane and secured with bandage around the body of the rat. The skin under the dosing area was excised and prepared for autoradiography and morphological (both light and electron microscopy) study. Ritschel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>) proposed the following mechanism for forming the intracutaneous depot. &#x0201c;The major barrier for the absorption of drugs through the skin is the stratum corneum&#x02026;.The intercellular space volume is relatively small (1&#x02013;10%) and may be a major pathway for permeation but at the same time the intercellular lipids are important in controlling the percutaneous absorption. The swelling of intercellular spaces, and the accumulation of foreign material outside the cell membrane is seen in the presence of Transcutol (evident from electron micrographs). It appears that Transcutol may incorporate into the multiple bilayer due to its polar and non-polar nature and thereby swell the intercellular lipids without altering the multiple bilayer structure. These swollen lipids may hold hydrocortisone and thereby form an intracutaneous depot in the presence of Transcutol, since hydrocortisone has high affinity for Transcutol.&#x0201d;</p><p id="Par71">The aforementioned gel formulation (50% TRC:12% PG:10% Cab-O-Sil) was evaluated by Panchagnula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>) for delivery of hydrocortisone and dexamethasone <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. The amount of steroid permeating across the rat skin (<italic>in vitro</italic>) was significantly less compared to the control formulation (without Transcutol). This was concurrent with a 3-fold increase in the skin concentration of hydrocortisone with the Transcutol formulation. The subsequent <italic>in vivo</italic> rat experiments involving radiolabeled hydrocortisone, obtained by measuring the total radioactivity in the blood for up to 96&#x000a0;h corroborated with the <italic>in vitro</italic> results.

These drugs also have low water solubility (such as clobetasol 17-propionate at 0.004&#x000a0;mg/ml, griseofulvin at 0.008&#x000a0;mg/ml), papaverine at 0.013&#x000a0;mg/ml, dexamethasone at 0.089&#x000a0;mg/ml, or hydrocortisone at 0.32&#x000a0;mg/ml) or large octanol-water partition coefficients (such as meperidine having a log <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.7, clobetasol 17-propionate having a log <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.5, or papaverine having a log <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.2) and will not readily partition out of the stratum corneum into the viable epidermis. For this subset of drugs, certain <italic>in vitro</italic> techniques result in remarkably high concentrations of active being measured in the skin. Thus, the intracutaneous depot could also be termed Transcutol-enhanced stratum corneum reservoir function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>) .</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p id="Par73">This review was limited to a discussion of the enhancing mechanisms associated with simple Transcutol formulations, with a critical eye for the IVPT methodologies used in the published works. As presented, certain conclusions from past publications may be based on far less sophisticated evaluation techniques. An improved understanding of the skin physiology and emergence of new analytical techniques has facilitated this retrospective analysis of the past publications under a new light.</p><p id="Par74">Clearly, the role of Transcutol as drug solubilizer and/or enhancer for skin penetration, permeation, or retention varies depending on its use concentration (neat or diluted) and its mixtures with other enhancers (formulation). Alongside enhanced permeability, an increase of drug concentration in the skin is commonly observed with Transcutol formulations. This effect must not be confounded with certain reports of drug depot effect for Transcutol which in retrospect appear to be more dependent on the physical properties of the active and artifacts inherent to infinite dosing IVPT, than a phenomenon unique to Transcutol. The unique feature of Transcutol that should be the focus of formulation scientists is that Transcutol can readily penetrate the stratum corneum and strongly interact with the water of the intercellular path. This Transcutol/water interaction can modify the stratum corneum barrier in several ways. As Transcutol permeates the stratum corneum, it modifies the molecular mobility of the stratum corneum protein and lipids to be similar to PBS soaked skin, <italic>i.e.</italic>, decreases skin barrier function. When applied at high concentrations or neat, Transcutol dehydrates the stratum corneum and increases the skin barrier function. The skin permeation of Transcutol leads to increased drug solubility in the stratum corneum, decreasing the skin barrier for actives that readily partition into the viable epidermis and increases stratum corneum retention for actives that do not readily partition into the viable epidermis. The permeation of Transcutol facilitates also the co-administration of other penetration enhancers known to disrupt (fluidize) epidermal lipid structure, <italic>i.e.</italic>, decrease in skin barrier.</p><p id="Par75">Other important considerations highlighted in this review were monitoring of the changes in thermodynamic driving force and drug properties notably solubility and log <italic>P</italic> and charge. Important to consider is the potential solvent effect, <italic>i.e.</italic>, the ability of Transcutol to decrease charge of ionizable drugs due to its low dielectric constant when evaluating it as skin penetration enhancer.</p><p id="Par76">Acronyms<table-wrap id="Taba"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>Acronym</td><td>Description</td><td>Trade name</td></tr><tr><td>DEGEE</td><td>Diethylene glycol monoethyl ether</td><td>Transcutol&#x000ae;</td></tr><tr><td>DEGME</td><td>Diethylene glycol methyl ether</td><td>&#x02013;</td></tr><tr><td>EtOH</td><td>Ethanol</td><td>&#x02013;</td></tr><tr><td>IPM</td><td>Isopropyl myristate</td><td>&#x02013;</td></tr><tr><td>IVPT</td><td><italic>In vitro</italic> permeation test</td><td/></tr><tr><td>LABH</td><td>Caprylo-caproyl 4-macrogolglycerides</td><td>Labrafac&#x02122;

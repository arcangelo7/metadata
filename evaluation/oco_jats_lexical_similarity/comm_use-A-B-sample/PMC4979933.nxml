A systematic review exploring whether adherence to cardiovascular therapies influenced the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) concluded that a significant proportion of people did not adhere to cardiovascular medications and as much as 9% of all CVD events in Europe could be attributed to poor adherence to vascular medications alone.<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Elsewhere, De Simoni and colleagues found few trial interventions supporting the effect of medication adherence on lowering blood pressure in survivors of stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA). Trials, which included highly-selected stroke populations, largely excluded patients with any significant cognitive deficit and did not account for the caregiver role in the lives of stroke patients.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>There have been few studies on adherence barriers in stroke. Kronish and colleagues identified concerns about medication and knowledge of stroke prevention therapies as important barriers among survivors of stroke.<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In another study, beliefs about medication, side effects of medication and the inadequate provision of information were considered important barriers to medication adherence.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Further evidence on factors affecting adherence after stroke could address the poor uptake of these medications.

A list of patients aged &#x0003e;55 years, with a history of stroke or/TIA was compiled and sent to the GPs for review. Anyone who was considered unfit to participate in the research (that is, was seriously ill or terminally ill) was excluded and not approached by the practice. To achieve a maximum spread of age, socioeconomic status (Indices of Multiple Deprivation score<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), sex and disability (using modified Rankin score<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), purposive sampling was undertaken.

The final number of interviews was determined by the point of data saturation.</p><boxed-text position="float"><sec><title>How this fits in</title><p>Medication nonadherence is known to be problematic among stroke survivors, contributing to suboptimal health outcomes. Multiple barriers to medication adherence have been identified and characterised as specific to the individual, the medication, or the healthcare setting. This qualitative investigation of the attitudes of 28 survivors, 14 caregivers, and five GPs found patient barriers, such as their knowledge of stroke and medication, and medication barriers, such as patient beliefs about treatment, to be important. A collaborative approach is needed to address important barriers to medication adherence in UK general practice.</p></sec></boxed-text></sec><sec><title>Semi-structured interviews</title><p>Semi-structured interviews provided an opportunity for in-depth investigation of people&#x02019;s personal perspectives, using an open-ended line of questioning, which defined the area to be explored.<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> A topic schedule guided the line of questioning and prompts encouraged further discussion (<xref rid="app1" ref-type="app">Appendix 1</xref>). Two survivors piloted the patient topic guides and recommendations were incorporated. A clinical researcher provided feedback on the GP topic guide. Interviews were conducted in the patient&#x02019;s home or the practice. Discussion topics included attitudes to secondary prevention care, medication beliefs, adherence to treatment, carer role, GPs attitudes towards current practice, and barriers to uptake. Interviews were conducted between June 2013 and February 2014, lasted 1.0&#x02013;1.5 hours and were audiotaped and transcribed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Data analysis</title><p>To ensure reliability of interpretation, transcripts were initially read by one of the authors and inaccuracies resolved by listening to the recordings. NVivo 9 was used to organise, code, and manage the data. Transcripts were entered into the program and coded, using grounded theory and followed a constant comparative analysis<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> approach, in which key points were identified from the data and coded individually. An iterative process of data collection and data analysis was undertaken. Initially, chunks of data were coded. Codes were then grouped into similar concepts and themes and categories were formed. A process of identification and refinement of categories followed. As groups were compared further, more abstract categories developed until the core themes emerged. To strengthen the validity of findings and ensure rigour, 20% of all interviews were double-coded by a second member of the research team. Inconsistencies were resolved through discussion with a third author until a consensus on the final themes was reached.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In total, 33 interviews were completed: five with GPs and 28 with stroke survivors, 14 of whom had a caregiver present.

Two key themes were identified. The first, patient level barriers, included the subthemes ability to self-care, knowledge of stroke and medication, and survivor&#x02019;s tendency to trivialise stroke. The second key theme, medication level barriers, included the subthemes beliefs about how pills work, importance of taking medication, attitudes to missing tablets, difficulties taking medications, changing medication, and burden of treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>An important strength was the inclusion of caregivers and GPs alongside patients, providing diversity of opinion. Employing a semi-structured interview methodology allowed participants maximum scope to dictate the direction of conversation and permitted an in-depth assessment of the topic area. This study offers a unique perspective on medication adherence barriers through the perceptions of stroke survivors, caregivers, and GPs. Due to the small number of GPs, it is unclear whether these views are representative of health professionals. Recruitment through five practices may have also limited the potential to generalise findings to the wider stroke population. Survivors were predominantly white, few were significantly disabled, and none had substantial cognitive impairment. Future research could include patients with aphasia who are dependent on others and patients from ethnic minorities in whom CVD is known to be prevalent.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with existing literature</title><p>Similar investigations from France and UK also reported that lack of symptoms and knowledge were important barriers to adherence.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Poor knowledge contributed to misunderstanding, with stroke frequently trivialised and its symptoms ignored. This is perhaps not surprising, given that half of this study&#x02019;s sample reported experiencing a TIA or mini-stroke, where symptoms usually disappear within 24 hours. Indeed, this absence of symptoms has often been identified as an important reason for the lack of urgency among survivors seeking help following stroke onset.<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Elsewhere, a systematic review of qualitative studies on patients&#x02019; understanding of hypertension and medication-taking identified side effects and a dislike of medication as key reasons for not continuing treatment.<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>Lack of knowledge, doubts about treatment efficacy and prioritising medications are in line with previous work in which poor adherence was linked with being likely to question the purpose of medication, having a poor understanding of therapy and concerns around the lack of information provided by the health professional.<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Prioritising medications due to perceived importance and treating the most salient symptoms corresponds with patients performing a risk&#x02013;benefit assessment, in which condition severity and knowledge of medication influence the decision to use treatment.<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The potential for positive beliefs on medication to influence subsequent behaviour suggest that exploring beliefs among survivors of stroke should be considered in an effort to improve medication adherence.<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The lack of knowledge identified among stroke survivors and caregivers suggests a need for improved education around stroke and treatment of the condition. Although education is a key component of providing stroke care, both survivors and caregivers face considerable barriers to information.<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>The present investigation confirms previously reported barriers, including difficulties swallowing or accessing medication;<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> frequent changing of medication;<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> use of storage devices;<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> treatment complexity; and the influence of comorbidities.<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Complex medication regimens are important factors in adherence to chronic conditions, including hypertension and CVD.<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> While reducing the daily medication dose can improve adherence to antihypertensives,<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> recent research has suggested a fixed-dose combination (FDC) polypill can improve adherence to medications<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and address the barriers reported here.</p><p>These findings add to the growing body of literature on barriers to medication adherence in stroke. The failure of patients to act on stroke symptoms may represent a broader lack of knowledge associated with experiencing a TIA. Research into behaviour following a TIA indicates that a delay in seeking treatment is not uncommon, attributed not only to the recognition of symptoms but also the role of others and interactions with the healthcare provider.<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> This study highlights the important role of the caregiver in providing information and facilitating medication-taking behaviour. Further work exploring the role of the caregiver is therefore warranted. Inadequate stroke knowledge and information provided by the GP has been reported previously, indicating there are significant unmet needs within this group.<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> While the measurement of adherence was beyond the scope of the current study, exploring how the beliefs and perspectives of survivors reflect actual levels of adherence should also be considered. Determining how the barriers identified here relate to actual adherence may help determine where secondary prevention efforts should be focused in the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Implications for practice</title><p>These findings provide an important basis from where effective adherence interventions to improve stroke care may be developed and implemented in clinical practice. Interventions are needed to address barriers to medication adherence among survivors of stroke and ultimately improve stroke outcomes within this population. This study suggests that increased efforts to improve awareness of stroke and secondary prevention medication is warranted. Given their potentially significant role in managing medication, it is important that caregivers are fully engaged with efforts aimed at addressing barriers and improving adherence to stroke medication. It is likely that caregiver support may be important for maintaining adherence among those survivors with cognitive limitations, who were largely overlooked in the present study, and who may themselves face considerable barriers to adherence.</p><p>Adopting a collaborative approach between the patient, caregiver, and practitioner, as well as the wider primary healthcare team of practice nurses and pharmacists, who can also play a role in facilitating adherence, should be considered and can be a focus for future work in this area. Finally, developing the patient&#x02013;practitioner relationship and facilitating better communication can enhance survivors&#x02019; understanding and knowledge of stroke and medication, while encouraging better adherence through challenging barriers to treatment.</p><p>In conclusion, important barriers to stroke medication adherence within UK general practice have been identified. Interventions are needed to address challenges associated with suboptimal adherence, including the provision of inadequate information, the role of the caregiver, recognition of stroke symptoms, patient beliefs about medication, and the burden of secondary prevention treatment. This investigation provides insight on the perspectives of practitioners, caregivers, and survivors, highlighting the complex and multifactorial barriers they face to stroke medication.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank all the stroke survivors, caregivers, and health professionals who participated in this

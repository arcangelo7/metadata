Reports of the effects of vitamin D on osteoclasts, however, are conflicting, showing both inhibition and stimulation. Finding that resorbing osteoclasts in human bone express vitamin D receptor (VDR), we examined their response to different concentrations of 25-hydroxy vitamin D<sub>3</sub> [25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>] (100 or 500&#x02009;nmol<bold>&#x000b7;</bold>L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D<sub>3</sub> [1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>] (0.1 or 0.5&#x02009;nmol<bold>&#x000b7;</bold>L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) metabolites in cell cultures. Specifically, CD14+ monocytes were cultured in charcoal-stripped serum in the presence of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) histochemical staining assays and dentine resorption analysis were used to identify the size and number of osteoclast cells, number of nuclei per cell and resorption activity. The expression of VDR was detected in human bone tissue (<italic>ex vivo</italic>) by immunohistochemistry and <italic>in vitro</italic> cell cultures by western blotting. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to determine the level of expression of vitamin D-related genes in response to vitamin D metabolites. VDR-related genes during osteoclastogenesis, shown by qRT-PCR, was stimulated in response to 500&#x02009;nmol<bold>&#x000b7;</bold>L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> and 0.1&#x02013;0.5&#x02009;nmol<bold>&#x000b7;</bold>L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>, upregulating cytochrome P450 family 27 subfamily B member 1 (<italic>CYP27B1</italic>) and cytochrome P450 family 24 subfamily A member 1 (<italic>CYP24A1</italic>). Osteoclast fusion transcripts transmembrane 7 subfamily member 4 (<italic>tm7sf4</italic>) and nuclear factor of activated T-cell cytoplasmic 1 (<italic>nfatc1</italic>) where downregulated in response to vitamin D metabolites. Osteoclast number and resorption activity were also increased. Both 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> reduced osteoclast size and number when co-treated with RANKL and M-CSF. The evidence for VDR expression in resorbing osteoclasts <italic>in vivo</italic> and low-dose effects of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> on osteoclasts <italic>in vitro</italic> may therefore provide insight into the effects of clinical vitamin D treatments, further providing a counterpoint to the high-dose effects reported from <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Vitamin D was discovered based on its role as an anti-rachitic agent and it is now well understood that vitamin D deficiency results in rickets in adolescents and osteomalacia in adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> Regulation of calcium and phosphate by vitamin D is widely studied and it is known to have a major role in maintaining a healthy skeleton. Conversely, vitamin D deficiency on bone <italic>in vivo</italic> can be compensated by the administration of calcium and phosphate. There is also growing evidence that vitamin D has a direct effect on bone cells; osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts.<sup>2</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">&#x02013;4</xref></sup></p><p><italic>In vitro</italic> studies have revealed that osteoblasts and osteocytes can locally synthesize the active metabolite 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> as they express <italic>CYP27B1</italic>, as well as having the ability to locally catabolize vitamin D by expressing the <italic>CYP24A1</italic> enzyme.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-derived osteoclasts have been shown to express <italic>CYP27B1</italic> and are capable of metabolizing 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> into 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>, suggesting that metabolism of vitamin D has a role in osteoclast differentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> The level of <italic>CYP27B1</italic> transcript expression has been shown to increase during RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation in PBMCs as well as in RAW 264.7 murine cell line.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup></p><p>Our current understanding of the effect of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> on osteoclast behavior is that 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> promotes formation, but inhibits the resorptive activity of mature osteoclasts derived from human PBMCs and murine cell line RAW 264.7.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> The action of vitamin D on the reduction of osteoclastogenesis is not well defined, but it has been suggested that the metabolism of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> into 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> reduces osteoclast resorptive capacity by the modification of cellular adhesion and a reduction in the migration of resorptive osteoclasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> It has further been proposed that the action of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> on bone resorption might be by an increase in the proliferation of the precursors of osteoclasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup></p><p>It has been reported that VDR is not expressed by mature osteoclasts <italic>in vivo</italic> human tissues, but rather in osteoclast precursors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> Stimulation of osteoclast formation by 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> has been shown to be by the upregulation of RANKL in osteoblasts and osteocytes and a direct cell-to-cell contact between osteoclast precursors and osteoblasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> Osteoclast function can be blocked by osteoprotegerin, a decoy receptor for RANKL, and osteoprotegerin has been shown to be downregulated in osteoblasts by 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15 bib16 bib17">15&#x02013;17</xref></sup></p><p>Vitamin D metabolites have been used as therapeutic drugs for the treatment of osteoporosis, as bone mass density has been shown to increase in these patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> Paradoxically, suppression of bone resorption should lead to an increase in bone mass density. Several studies have been conducted to elucidate the effect of vitamin D on osteoclasts <italic>in vivo</italic>; however, the effects have been reported as both inhibitory and stimulatory, and the exact mechanisms remain unknown.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> In <italic>in vitro</italic> studies (doses of more than 1&#x02009;nmol&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> has been shown to have both stimulatory as well as inhibitory effects on osteoclast activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19 bib20 bib21 bib22">19&#x02013;22</xref></sup></p><p>In co-culture studies of osteoblasts and hematopoietic cells, active metabolites of vitamin D has been shown to stimulate osteoclastogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23 bib24 bib25">23&#x02013;25</xref></sup> This stimulation has been shown to be an increase in RANKL production and consequently osteoclast stimulation.

As the active metabolites of vitamin D has been used therapeutically, the increase in bone mass density in osteoporotic patients has been assumed to be suppression of bone resorption. Thus, the effects of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> on osteoclast bone resorption in <italic>in vitro</italic> studies seem to be opposite to <italic>in vivo</italic> studies.

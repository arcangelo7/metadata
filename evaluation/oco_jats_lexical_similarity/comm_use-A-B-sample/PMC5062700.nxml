and routine procedure nowadays, the Jatene operation (arterial switch operation - ASO)
being the treatment of choice for almost all cases of simple TGA and all other
presentations, including TGA with ventricular septal defects, pulmonary stenosis and
aortic arch anomalies.</p><p>In developing countries, issues like late presentation and lack of neonatal care
infrastructure are problems faced on a daily basis. Certainly, that interferes with
surgical results. It is also known that anatomical aspects impose morbidity for a child
with TGA that requires an operation. Coronary artery anomalies are on the top of the
list of anatomical abnormalities and can affect early and late results<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Considering all of the coronary artery anomalies described, one of the most frightening
types for surgical translocation are the coronaries with intramural
course<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. In
this edition of the Brazilian Journal of Cardiovascular Surgery, Mishra et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> report an
alternative technique to deal with intramural coronaries in TGA patients.</p><p>For a surgical team that is planning a Jatene operation, previous and detailed
information about coronary arteries anatomy is essential for an adequate operative plan.
Usually, transthoracic echocardiogram provides that information, but in some cases, the
surgeon identifies the anomaly while operating, during the initial dissection of the
great vessels or, more frequently, after opening and examining the aorta and the
ostia.</p><p>Identifying a coronary intramural course during the operation is not a desired situation.
The surgeon has to decide the best correction and strategy under such a great and
unexpected pressure. In their paper, Mishra et al had to deal with this situation in
every case, which affords more importance and relevance to the surgical team,
considering the adequate results achieved<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>There are many surgical techniques described in the literature to treat intramural
coronary arteries during a Jatene operation<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. Almost all of them follow the philosophy of using the
unroofing procedure for the intramural course and, often, separation of the coronary
ostia, particularly when they arise very close to each other<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. Then, right and left coronaries
(after being unroofed) are translocated to different spots at the neoaorta.</p><p>The absence of preoperative diagnosis is not uncommon and may cause eventual lesion
during coronary dissection in intramural cases<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>, mainly when the left coronary is committed by
the intramural course. When the surgeon begins the ostial excision with no information
or suspicious of an intramural course, the coronary can be damaged, with unpredictable
surgical maneuvers to fix it. The use of an instrument to explore the coronary route is
necessary when there is a possibility of coronary anomaly. The external view and
inspection of a possible intramural course must be completed with a meticulous internal
inspection and adequate definition of the trajectory and length of the intramural
course. It is also safer and better to separate the coronaries when they are very close
to each other and then reallocate them separately in a more favorable anatomical
position in the neoaorta, avoiding kinking, stretching and torsion.</p><p>The technique described by Mishra et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>, using intracoronary shunts inside the intramural course
of the coronary artery, seems to be very useful, providing more safety in the unroofing
procedure. We agree with the authors that we should have intracoronary shunts of
different sizes available during a Jatene operation to provide an additional strategy to
deal with such a challenging situation.</p><p>We shall emphasize that the Jatene operation in the presence of intramural coronary
arteries is a high-risk operation<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> and must be considered by a very well trained surgeon and
surgical team, in a hospital with adequate experience and structure, in order to achieve
the best result expected.</p></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Pasquali</surname><given-names>SK</given-names></name><name><surname>Hasselblad</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name><name><surname>Kong</surname><given-names>DF</given-names></name><name><surname>Sanders</surname><given-names>SP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Coronary artery pattern and outcome of arterial switch operation

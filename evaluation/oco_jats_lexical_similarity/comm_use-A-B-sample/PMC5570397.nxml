myocardial infarction (MI) ventricular septal rupture (VSR) and to develop a
protocol for its management.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This was a single center, retrospective-prospective study (2009-2014),
involving 55 patients with post MI VSR. The strengths of association between
risk factors and prognosis were assessed using multivariate logistic
regression analysis. The UNM Post MI VSR management and prognosis scoring
systems (UPMS &#x00026; UPPS) were developed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Thirty-day mortality was 52.5% (35% in the last 3 years). Twenty-eight (70%)
patients underwent concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting. Residual
ventricular septal defect was found in 3 (7.5%) patients. The multivariate
analysis showed low mean blood pressure with intra-aortic balloon pump (OR
11.43, <italic>P</italic>=0.001), higher EuroSCORE II (OR 7.47,
<italic>P</italic>=0.006), higher Killip class (OR 27.95,
<italic>P</italic>=0.00), and shorter intervals between MI and VSR (OR
7.90, <italic>P</italic>=0.005) as well as VSR and Surgery (OR 5.76,
<italic>P</italic>=0.016) to be strong predictors of mortality.
Concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting (<italic>P</italic>=0.17) and
location (<italic>P</italic>=0.25) of VSR did not affect the outcome. Mean
follow-up was 635.8&#x000b1;472.5 days and 17 out of 19 discharged patients
were in NYHA class I-II.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The UNM Post-MI VSR Scoring Systems (UPMS &#x00026; UPPS) help in management and
prognosis, respectively. They divide patients into 3 groups: 1) Immediate
Surgery - Patients with scores of &#x0003c;25 require immediate surgery,
preferably with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, and have poor
prognosis; 2) Those with scores of 25-75 should be managed with "Optimal
Delay" and they have intermediate outcomes; 3) Patients with scores of
&#x0003e;75 can undergo Elective Repair and they are likely to have good
outcomes.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Myocardial Infarction</kwd><kwd>Heart Septal Defects, Ventricular</kwd><kwd>Cardiac Surgical Procedures</kwd><kwd>Prognosis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><table-wrap id="t5" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="22%" span="1"/><col width="22%" span="1"/><col width="10%" span="1"/><col width="22%" span="1"/><col width="22%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th colspan="2" align="left" style="background-color:#e6e7e8" rowspan="1">Abbreviations,

infarction (MI) ventricular septal rupture (VSR) (post-MI VSR) is still associated
with a high mortality rate of 20%-50%<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. In unoperated
cases, early death is common; 50% die in &#x0003c;7 days, 70% within 2 weeks, and 80%-90%
die within 4 weeks<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The first surgical repair of post-MI VSR was performed by Cooley et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>, in 1957, followed by documentation
of several other series<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. However, the available
literature is very scant and scattered due to the rarity, discrepancy in clinical
presentation, and complex natural history of the condition<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>. Timing of surgery and associated
co-morbidities play an important role in determining the outcome of
patients<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. In recent
times, due to advances in interventional cardiology, extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation (ECMO) and intensive care unit (ICU) care, a multitude of options have
become available to the 'heart team' to do either an immediate surgery or
delay/defer surgery. However, objective guidelines for proper management of this
entity are still not available due to the relative rarity of this highly fatal
condition.</p><p>We present our center's experience with 55 patients with post-MI VSR and we suggest
the use of the UNM Post-MI VSR Scoring Systems to guide management and indicate
prognosis of patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>Between January 2009 and January 2014, 55 patients were diagnosed with post-MI VSR
and 40 of them (26 male; 14 female), who underwent surgery in the Department of
Cardiothoracic Surgery, U.N. Mehta Institute of Cardiology &#x00026; Research Center,
were included in our study. Ten patients who did not give consent for surgery were
managed medically. The remaining five patients underwent elective device closure
since they presented VSR later than 4 weeks after MI, were in New York Heart
Association (NYHA) I/II class, and did not require coronary artery bypass grafting
(CABG). After approval from the ethics committee, perioperative data were collected
from hospital records and written informed consent of the living patients was
obtained for follow-up. Data for the following variables were collected: age,
gender, time between MI and VSR, urgency of operation, prior cardiac surgery,
history of previous (&#x0003e;3 months) MI, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, respiratory
disease, renal dysfunction, congestive cardiac failure, cardiogenic shock,
intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) usage, mean blood pressure before and after IABP
insertion, inotrope usage, ventilatory support, EuroSCORE II, Killip class, extent
of coronary disease, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). The outcomes
measured for our study were: hospital mortality, length of ICU stay, post-operative
hospital stay, stroke, peri- operative MI, re-operation for bleeding, renal failure,
and need for tracheostomy. We also noted the incidence of arrhythmias and duration
of post-operative inotropes and IABP support.</p><sec><title>Surgical Technique</title><p>After complete cardiological assessment using echocardiography and coronary
angiography, the patients were approached through a median sternotomy. IABP was
instituted in all patients (if not inserted in the pre-operative period) just
after induction of anesthesia. After cardiopulmonary bypass was established
using aortic and bicaval cannulation, the aorta was cross-clamped and antegrade
blood cardioplegia and intermittent retrograde cardioplegia were used in all
cases. If CABG was required, distal anastomoses were made first. A vacuum
positioner system was used to expose the posterior VSRs. The septal rupture was
approached through the infarcted area of the myocardium, preferably through the
left ventricle. A variant of the Daggett's technique was used<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>. Infarctectomy was not
routinely performed, but care was taken to go at least 1 cm beyond the infarcted
margin. All the anterior and most of the posterior defects were closed by a 0.6
mm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) patch fixed to the non-infarcted region of the
septum with interrupted horizontal pledgeted 4-0 polypropylene mattress suture
(26 mm needle), keeping the pledget on right ventricular side. Deep bites
extending into healthy myocardium were taken to prevent sutures from cutting
through. Infarct exclusion technique was used when margins were too friable or
healthy area was indistinguishable from the infarcted area. The ventriculotomy
was closed using 4-0 polypropylene sutures (26 mm needle) in interrupted and
continuous fashion with PTFE felt strips on each side of the ventriculotomy, as
described by Daggett et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>. After, cardiopulmonary bypass was discontinued, oxygen
saturation of right atrial and pulmonary arterial blood was measured along with
transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to rule out residual ventricular septal
defect. IABP and inodilators (levosimendan/milrinone) were used to stabilize the
patient in the immediate postoperative period. Inotropes were guided by cardiac
output measured through the Swan Ganz catheter. All patients were started on
enteral nutrition through nasogastric tube from postoperative day 1. Patients
were routinely ventilated till inotropic requirement was high. Patients were
weaned off from the ventilator once inotropic requirement became reasonable
(vasoactive inotropic score of &#x0003c;10)<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> and respiratory parameters were satisfactory. IABP
continued to be used for at least 4-5 days postoperatively and then it was
gradually tapered off once inotropic support decreased to a minimal dose
(vasoactive score of &#x02264;5). Inodilators were tapered 1 or 2 days after IABP
removal. Postoperatively, patients were given amiodarone, antiplatelets,
statins, beta blockers, spironolactone, and angiotensin-converting-enzyme
inhibitor (ACE) inhibitors. Amiodarone was discontinued after 15 days of
surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Patient Follow-up</title><p>Late mortality, NYHA class, and residual defects were noted on follow-up.
Patients were followed up in an outpatient setting and/or by telephonic
interview. Echocardiography was performed at three-month intervals for the first
6 months, and then at 6-month intervals thereafter. Preoperative echo parameters
were compared with those at follow-up. Residual defects, if any, were analyzed.
Presence or absence of mitral regurgitation, right and left ventricular
function, and pulmonary artery pressures were also analyzed at follow-up
echocardiography.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The statistical calculations were performed using SPSS software v 20.0 (Chicago,
IL, USA). Continuous data were expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation
(SD). Patient survival rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier. Univariate
analysis of continuous data was performed using Student's t-test, whereas
chi-square test was used for the categorical data. Multivariate logistic
regression was used to estimate independent risk factors for the factors with a
significant <italic>P</italic> value (&#x0003c;0.05) on univariate analysis. An
attempt has been made to develop a deterministic quantitative risk score in
order to assess the risk involved with patient's clinical condition. Factors for
the risk score calculation were screened by a univariate logistic screening
model. Furthermore, these clinical factors were used in risk score calculations.
Theoretical details for the index can be given as follows. The risk score is
comprised of two elements: weightage {statistical weightage (as provided by
regression analysis) of factors thought to be important as per surgical
literature} and value of the clinical parameter. Let
'<bold><italic>X<sub>i</sub></italic></bold>' be the value of the corresponding clinical variable and
'<bold><italic>W<sub>i</sub></italic></bold>' be the combined weightage of the corresponding variable.
Thus, the proposed risk score is a linear function of clinical parameters given
as below:</p><p>
<disp-formula id="e1"><mml:math id="e01"><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle mathsize="12.0pt"><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">Risk</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.33em"/><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">Factor</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>&#x02211;</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">W</mml:mi><mml:mi mathsize="50.0%" mathvariant="italic">i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">x</mml:mi><mml:mi mathsize="50.0%" mathvariant="italic">i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula>
</p><p>To assess the performance of the risk score with respect to predicting survival,
a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted for the risk scores.
The area under the curve (AUC) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were then
estimated. Various cut-off scores were calculated and analyzed for survival.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Patient Characteristics</title><p>Sixty-five percent of the patients undergoing surgical post-MI VSR repair were

</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Post-MI VSR occurs only in 0.2% of patients with acute MI and it was first described
by Latham<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> in 1846. In the
current study, we have reviewed our experience of 55 patients with post-MI VSR
within a span of 5 years. Ten patients were either not referred for surgery or
refused surgery. This phenomenon has been documented by Labrousse et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> and GUSTO-I trial<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>, which suggest that cardiologists
themselves decide about suitability of patients for surgery, leading to fewer
patients being referred for surgery. In developing countries, financial constraints
also come into picture, further aggravating the situation. Ideally, those patients
should be evaluated by a "heart team" consisting of at least one cardiologist, one
cardiac surgeon, and one critical care expert.</p><p>All patients who were not operated eventually died. Our overall postoperative
mortality was 52.5%. However, considering the fact that patients who underwent
device closure (n=5) could also have been managed surgically with almost 100%
survival (as also seen in our study, all patients with score &#x0003e; 75 survived). This
could have resulted in a much lower mortality for our surgical series. Mortality has
also been decreasing progressively with better understanding of the condition,
'optimum delay' in surgery after occurrence of VSR, better cardiopulmonary bypass
management, improved postoperative care, and extended postoperative IABP usage. Our
mortality rate in the first 2 years (2009-2011) was 70% (14/20), decreasing to 35%
(7/20) in the last three years (2011-2014). To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first study reporting an experience of 55 (40 operated + 5 elective device
closure + 10 unoperated) patients within a time span of 5 years from a single
center. Higher incidence of post-MI VSR in developing countries could be due to
unavailability/delay in primary revascularization or thrombolysis of patients with
acute MI.</p><p>We found post-MI VSR to be more common in males, especially in those having
hypertension. This finding is similar to that observed by Arnaoutakis et al.
<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>. But it is
contradictory to the reports from GUSTO-1<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>, Barker et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>, and Serpytis et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> who found female gender to be a risk factor for the
development of VSR. We also found that single vessel disease (45%) was the most
common type of coronary artery disease associated with post-MI VSR, followed by
double vessel disease (37.5%). Similar findings have also been reported by
others<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Regarding clinical status, all authors found higher mortality in patients with
preoperative cardiogenic shock<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>. In our
series, lower mean blood pressure after IABP insertion was found to be an
independent risk factor for mortality. We have not found any effect of LVEF on
immediate outcome of patients, while Huang et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> found preserved LVEF to have a beneficial effect
on early outcomes. In patients with post-MI VSR, LVEF can be fallaciously high due
to the presence of a left to right shunt. Therefore, in those patients, pulmonary
blood flow/systemic blood flow (Qp/Qs), and pulmonary artery pressures should always
be measured to estimate the exact degree of myocardial dysfunction.</p><p>The prevalence of triple vessel disease and double vessel disease was higher in the
mortality group compared to the survivor group, however, the difference was not
statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>=0.11, 0.25). Thus, the number of
coronary vessels involved appears to have no significant effect on immediate
surgical outcome of the patients. Similar observations were made by Labrousse et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Unlike others, we
did not find any protective effect of concomitant CABG in terms of early
mortality<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>. During follow-up, there was no significant difference in
postoperative ejection fraction and NYHA status between patients with concurrent
CABG and those without CABG (37.7&#x000b1;6.01 <italic>vs.</italic>
42.5&#x000b1;7.05). This probably reflects the presence of SVD in most surviving
patients.</p><p>Jeppsson et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> and Dalrymple-Hay
et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> attributed the high
mortality rates in posterior VSRs to the difficulty of operative exposure and
associated right ventricular infarction. Posterior VSRs associated with right
ventricular infarction have worse prognosis as compared to posterior VSRs with left
ventricular infarction or anterior VSRs. In our study, these differences did not
reach a statistically significant level. Severe right ventricular dysfunction
appears to be a key factor affecting these findings. In patients with posterior VSR
and right ventricular infarction, VSR must be approached through the infarcted right
ventricle rather than the non-infarcted left ventricle to preserve left ventricular
function and to avoid inadvertent damage to a normal obtuse marginal
artery/posterior left ventricular artery supplying the inferior wall of left
ventricle. One should be very careful while closing the ventriculotomy as this right
ventricle is extremely friable and the sutures can give way. We recommend the use of
glue (cyanoacrylate adhesive) along with PTFE felt to buttress the whole inferior
wall around the ventriculotomy in such patients to prevent bleeding and late
aneurysm formation. The glue was applied to ventriculotomy margins before closure
began in order to prevent sutures from cutting through and needle holes from
bleeding. A second layer of glue can be applied later, if required, over the suture
margins. We do not however recommend the routine use of glue to decrease the chance
of postoperative bleeding as less postoperative bleeding and blood transfusion
requirements were observed if VSR was approached through the infarcted region of
left ventricle. Though in our study location of VSR did not affect results, we think
apical VSRs have the best prognosis because they are mostly associated with more
distal occlusion of the culprit vessel, thus preserving blood supply to most of the
septum. Being small and easily accessible, they are also easier to close
surgically/interventionally.</p><p>Time periods from MI to VSR and VSR to Surgery seem to be the crucial factors
affecting survival. The greater chances of mortality in patients operated early
after occurrence of VSR could be explained by the fact that unstable hemodynamics
and ischemia-reperfusion injury to recently infarcted myocardium further stuns the
myocardium. The beneficial effects of the optimum waiting period are also due to the
development of firmer scars in infarcted areas of the myocardium, facilitating
surgical repair, decreasing risk of recurrent or residual defects, and ultimately
improving prognosis<sup>[<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>. This was
also observed in the present study, as intervals between MI and VSR and VSR and
Surgery were found to be independent predictors of hospital mortality, thereby
prompting their use in our scoring system. Similar observations were made by Poulsen
et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>, Papalexopoulou et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>, and Jones et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup>. We also observed
that 16 (76%) out of 21 patients died if the surgery was carried out &#x0003c;3 days from
occurrence of VSR while only 26% (5/19) died when surgery was performed &#x0003e;3 days
after occurrence of VSR. This suggests that, if we can delay the surgery for &#x0003e;3
days after the occurrence of VSR, mortality of the patients decreases by 50% and if
we can delay it for 4-6 weeks, then it further decreases to almost 0. Time between
VSR and Surgery appears to be the most important interval (statistically) as it
signifies the time when the heart and various body systems get to adapt to the
hemodynamic consequences of sudden left to right shunt. Moreover, this is the most
important determinant of the quality of margins of VSR, whether fibrosed or friable.
A short interval between MI and VSR is suggestive of severe ischemia and
unavailability of collateral circulation. A long interval between MI and Surgery (MI
to VSR + VSR to Surgery) suggests the heart is well collateralized and/or systems
have had enough time to adapt to altered hemodynamics. This is where IABP proves so
beneficial. We emphasize the institution of preoperative IABP to stabilize the
patients. IABP acts by decreasing the afterload of left ventricle and improves
coronary circulation. Ultimately, the reperfusion injury associated with
cardiopulmonary bypass and revascularization is decreased, especially on a stunned
myocardium. We instituted IABP in 39 patients preoperatively. One patient had severe
aortoiliac disease with left subclavian stenosis, so IABP was inserted through the
right subclavian artery in the operating room. Some hemodynamically unstable
patients failed to stabilize despite high inotropic support and IABP could be
salvaged by using ECMO. ECMO was instituted in one patient as he could not be weaned
off cardiopulmonary bypass, even with IABP and higher inotropic support. ECMO could
be weaned off in this patient in 60 hours and he made a complete recovery. Thus, the
'optimal delay' approach is extremely beneficial for centers without ECMO support
since it improves patient outcomes.</p><p>UPMS helps in guiding the management of the patients with post-MI VSR. Based on our
results, our current protocol is that, upon arrival at an emergency unit, a 'heart
team' evaluates the patient. Patients with UPMS of &#x0003c;25 undergo emergency surgery
with ECMO support, if required. Patients with UPMS of 25-75 are optimally stabilized
before being taken up for surgery. This group benefits the most from 'Optimal Delay'
in surgery. Patients with a score of over 75 are most likely to survive and undergo
planned device or surgical closure. As described earlier, UPPS helps to
prognosticate patients with post-MI VSR. All patients with UPPS of &#x0003c;25 died
whereas none of the patients with UPPS &#x0003e; 75 did. Therefore, patients with a
higher UPPS have higher chances of survival.</p><p>In the current study, residual ventricular septal defects were observed in 3 (7.5%)
patients, which is lower than the various other series<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup>. These defects
were not present intraoperatively, but were found on postoperative echocardiography.
We close most of the VSRs with interrupted mattress sutures (modified Daggett's
technique<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>) so small
jets may be present in the gaps between the sutures or due to cutting through one of
the sutures. Infarct exclusion technique was used in 4 patients. However, it
requires a very big patch as well as bigger ventriculotomy and patch dehiscence
remains a possibility if even one bite cuts through. We feel that the interrupted
suture technique is the safest bet in VSRs with friable margins, as most of the
sutures will hold the patch in place, allowing for only small jets in case of suture
cutting through. We also observed that the proximal margin of the defect is usually
healthy as compared to the distal margin, probably due to better blood supply of
proximal septum, which may have patent septal arteries and collaterals. Hence, extra
care must be taken while suturing the distal margin to prevent residual ventricular
septal defects. Therefore, we grafted all LADs (in case of proximal LAD or left main
disease) if the first septal was visualized angiographically to preserve the blood
supply and to provide better healing of ventricular septum.</p><sec><title>Limitation</title><p>It should be mentioned that this study had some limitations. The main limitations
are the retrospective nature of our work and the sample size being smaller than
some multicenter trials. Also, all late presenting VSRs (&#x0003e; 4 weeks) were
closed by devices, which left only the worst patients for surgery. The mortality
rate of our study's surgical group may thus have been fallaciously high.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The strength of this study lies in it being a single, high-volume center data of a
considerably large group of patients undergoing surgical repair of post-MI VSR,

common/rare procedure provides a closer insight into the magnitude of a critical
condition than multicenter trials. Messages of the study are:</p><p>

cardiovascular surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Cross-sectional pilot study of a prospective cohort included in the
Documentation and Surgical Registry Center (CEDREC) for internal validation
of the QLCS questionnaire. Four hundred forty-five patients submitted to
cardiovascular surgery and who answered a QLCS questionnaire 30 days after
hospital discharge were included. It was applied via telephone. To verify
the questions' internal consistency, Cronbach's alpha was used. The total
QLCS score was calculated as the sum of 5 questions, ranging from 5 to 25
points. Mann-U-Whitney test was used to relate the symptoms with the quality
of life (QoL). Level of significance was 5%.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After 30 days of surgery, about 95% of the patients had already returned to
normal routine and 19% of them were already performing physical activity. In
the evaluation of the QLCS's internal consistency, a Cronbach's alpha of
0.74 was found, suggesting that this was probably an adequate questionnaire
to evaluate QoL in this population. In the comparison between the presence
and absence of symptoms and the median of QoL, the presence of pain at the
incision (<italic>P</italic>=0.002), chest pain
(<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001), shortness of breath
(<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001), and return to physical activity
(<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) were statistically significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The process of elaboration and validation of questionnaires includes a series

measurement are becoming a fundamental topic for the practice of Medicine<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>According to The World Health Organization Quality of Life Group (WHOQOL-group), QoL
is defined as an individual's perception of his/her position in life in the context
of the culture and value systems in which he/she lives and in relation to his/her
goals, expectations, standards, and concerns. It is a broad ranging concept affected
in a complex way by the person's physical health, psychological state, personal
beliefs, social relationships, and his/her relationship to salient features of
his/her environment<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The impact of any event or health status on a person's QoL depends to a large extent
on his/her personal projects, desires, and history<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. Although the most important indicator of health
status is the clinical outcome, QoL and patient satisfaction are key indicators for
the adequate understanding and treatment of pathologies<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. The QoL related to cardiovascular disease and the
impact of the treatment on each patient's life have been researched, contributing to
the clinical decision-making process, as well as improving patient care, aiming at a
more integral approach to health (physical, psychological, and social)<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>To evaluate QoL, you can choose to use generic questionnaires, which do not specify
the disease itself, such as the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health
Survey (MOS SF-36 or SF-36)<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>, and
its short version 12 (SF-12)<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>, or
The World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment (WHOQOL-100)<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>, and its summary version
(WHOQOL-BREF)<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>, or
specific questionnaires, developed for a particular pathology, such as the Kansas
City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) for heart failure<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Improving QoL is one of the main objectives for cardiovascular surgery, so a review
on this subject was published in 2011, which included 29 articles published between
January 2004 and December 2010, but only nine studies presented data on pre and
postoperative QoL, and that was a limitation<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. Another meta-analysis published in 2013<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> selected 15 articles on QoL in
the postoperative period of cardiovascular surgery, and most of the analyzed studies
showed a significant improvement in QoL in the evaluation instruments; the SF-36 was
the most used questionnaire in 43% of the studies.</p><p>Therefore, QoL measurement of the postoperative period of cardiovascular surgery is
crucial to evaluate the patients' treatment, and the creation and validation of a
current questionnaire which is more adequate for these patients' reality is of
fundamental importance. The objectives of this study were to create, based on an
adaptation of the main existing QoL questionnaires, and to validate a current and
adequate questionnaire, easy to apply, which can be performed via telephone, for the
reality of the postoperative period of cardiovascular surgery in Brazil.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>This is a pilot study for initial validation of the Quality of Life in Cardiovascular
Surgery (QLCS) questionnaire, using as sample the population included in the
Documentation and Surgical Registry Center (CEDREC) of a hospital specialized in
Cardiology. CEDREC is a computerized database specifically for patients undergoing
cardiovascular surgery in our hospital. Patients who were operated on and accepted
to participate in the database were included and monitored prospectively.</p><p>This cross-sectional study taken from a prospective cohort included patients who
underwent cardiovascular surgery, from July 2016 until October 2017, who accepted to
participate in CEDREC, and who properly answered a QoL questionnaire (the QLCS)
after thirty days of hospital discharge. Only patients under 18 years old were
excluded. All the other patients were included in the sample.</p><p>The questionnaire was created by a group of medical specialists, based on the main
existing QoL questionnaires (SF-36, SF-12, WHOQOL-100, WHOQOL-BREF), and adapted to
the current reality of Brazilian medicine. It is a simple and fast questionnaire,
easy to perform, and feasible to be applied via telephone. The questionnaire used by
CEDREC had 21 questions (<xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), being five
questions on QoL, which correspond to the QLCS questionnaire (<xref rid="t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), and the others were about medication, symptoms,
procedures, and internationalization in that period. These five QLCS questions were
created and considered adequate and clear enough by all medical experts to compose a
questionnaire whose main objective is to easily and quickly assess patients' QoL in
the postoperative period of cardiovascular surgery. The total QoL score was
calculated as the sum of the five QoL questions, ranging from 5 to 25 points. The
higher the value found, the better the QoL.</p><table-wrap id="t1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Complete questionnaire used by the Documentation and Surgical Registry Center

step with a pilot sample. In this pilot test, the questionnaire's final version is
administered to a large representative sample of respondents for whom the
questionnaire is intended. At this point, it is important to evaluate the
questionnaire's reliability. This is accomplished by assessing the internal
consistency and testing-retesting reliability. Internal consistency reflects the
extent to which the questionnaire items are intercorrelated or whether they are
consistent in measurement of the same construct<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. Internal consistency is commonly estimated using the
alpha coefficient, also known as Cronbach's alpha<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>For statistical analysis, Cronbach's alpha was used to verify the questionnaire's
internal consistency and to validate the questionnaire. Assuming a standard
deviation of approximately 6 units and a detectable difference of 3 points, with 5%
of alpha error and 95% of power, it would be required a total of 63 cases. The
quantitative variables were described by mean and standard deviation in the presence
of normal distribution, or median and interquartile range in the presence of
asymmetric distribution. The qualitative variables will be presented by absolute
frequencies (number of patients) and relative frequencies (percentages). The
Mann-U-Whitney test was used to relate the symptoms (qualitative variable) with the
QoL (quantitative variable). Level of significance was set at 5%.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS </title><p>Four hundred forty-five patients submitted to cardiovascular surgery, from July 2016

total of 198 (44%) cases, followed by coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with
164 (37%) cases, aortic surgeries with 39 (8.7%) cases, and congenital anomaly
correction surgery with 19 (4.2%) cases. The remainder comprised of 6 (1.3%) cases
of heart transplant surgeries, 7 (1.5%) cases of pericardiectomies, 4 (0.9%) cases
of myectomies, 3 (0.6%) cases of tumor removals, and 9 (2%) cases of reshaping and
cleaning. It is noteworthy that in some cases more than one type was performed at
the same surgery time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p><fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Types of surgeries performed.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-33-05-0476-g01"/></fig></p><p>After 30 days of surgery, 35% of the patients had incision pain, 17% wound infection,
23% chest pain, 22% lack of air, 1% fainting, 5% palpitation, and 43% other
symptoms. However, 95% of the patients had already returned to normal routine and
19% were already performing physical activity.</p><p>In the evaluation of the QLCS's internal consistency, a Cronbach's alpha of 0.74 was
found, proving this to be a questionnaire with adequate internal consistency. This
means that, in the evaluation of the degree of variation of these questions, it was
demonstrated that the items are appropriately related to each other.</p><p>When comparing between patients with and without incision pain after 30 days of
surgery, we observed that patients with this symptom presented a median of 19.0 in
the QLCS questionnaire, with lower quartile (LQ) of 16.0 and upper quartile (UQ) of
22.0, while those without incision pain presented a median of 20.0 (LQ=18.0; UQ=22).
When using the Mann-U-Whitney test, this observed reduction was significant
(<italic>P</italic>=0.002). The same was also observed for patients with chest
pain, with a median of 18.50 (LQ=16.0; UQ=21.0), when comparing with those without
chest pain, with a median of 20.0 (LQ=18.0; UQ=22.0); significant difference
(<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). The presence of shortness of breath also affected
the QLCS score, with a median of 18.0 (LQ=15.0; UQ=20.25), compared to its absence,
with a median of 21.0 (LQ=18.0; UQ=23.0); (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). So, in the
evaluation of symptoms and QLCS scores, the presence of pain at incision
(<italic>P</italic>=0.002), chest pain (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001), and
shortness of breath (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) negatively affected QoL. On the
other hand, other symptoms (<italic>P</italic>=0.075), fainting
(<italic>P</italic>=0.50), palpitations <italic>P</italic>=0.52), and infection
(<italic>P</italic>=0.48) weren't related to QoL. The return to physical
activity was also significant, the group that performed physical activity had a
higher median in the QLCS questionnaire (22.0; LQ=19.0; UQ=23.0) than the sedentary
group (19.0; LQ=17.0; UQ=22.0), improving QoL (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). When
comparing the median of the group that returned to the routine (20.0; LQ=18.0;
UQ=22.0) with the median of those who hadn't returned (17.0; LQ=16.0; UQ=22.0), it
wasn't significant (<italic>P</italic>=0.85). The comparison between the presence
and absence of symptoms and the median obtained in the QLCS questionnaire is shown
in box-and-whisker plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p><fig id="f2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Comparison between the presence and absence of symptoms and the median

in postoperative cardiovascular surgery patients in Brazil and other countries. The
QLCS is a new questionnaire with an internal consistency of 0.74 (Cronbach's alpha),
being probably a good questionnaire to evaluate QoL in this population in a fast,
easy, and objective way. Thus, it is possible to measure QoL in a practical way,
even in countries where there aren't many resources and incentives for research,
making possible a greater diffusion of QoL assessment by society, which contributes
to the universality of knowledge. When Cronbach's is 0, it indicates no internal
consistency (<italic>i.e.</italic>, none of the items are correlated with one
another), whereas, when it is 1, it reflects perfect internal consistency
(<italic>i.e.</italic>, all the items are perfectly correlated with one
another). In practice, Cronbach's alpha of at least 0.70 has been suggested to
indicate adequate internal consistency<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>. A low Cronbach's alpha value may be due to poor
inter-relatedness between items; as such, items with low correlations with the
questionnaire total score should be discarded or revised. On the other hand, an
alpha value that is too high (more than 0.90) suggests that some questionnaire items
may be redundant, and investigators may consider removing items that are essentially
asking the same thing in multiple ways<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The QoL in the postoperative period of cardiovascular surgery has been much studied
in the international literature, which justifies even more the creation of this
questionnaire. When referring to CABG, Aydin et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> compared pre and postoperative QoL in 120 patients
over 65 years, and the SF-36 for postoperative results were higher than the SF-36
for preoperative results (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). The same result of
improvement in QoL with CABG was also demonstrated by Dal Boni et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> and Gois et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>. In another study, Takiuti et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> compared clinical
treatment, percutaneous coronary intervention, and CABG in 483 patients with
coronary disease; there was an improvement in QoL in all domains and in the three
therapeutic options, but the surgery offered better results after four years of
follow-up.</p><p>In a Brazilian prospective cohort study with 44 elderly patients between 60 and 80
years of age, of both sexes, diagnosed with coronary artery disease, and undergoing
CABG, from June 2010 to June 2011, a significant increase was observed in SF-36
scores between the pre and postoperative periods (three and six months) for the
domains: functional capacity, pain, general health, vitality, and emotional
aspect.</p><p>Albert et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> found that in the
postoperative period of surgery for valvulopathy correction, the improvement of the
gradient resulted in an improvement in the QoL. Another study, conducted by Ferreira
et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>, showed that patients
with cardiovascular valvar disease have a better QoL three to six months after
surgery, compared to those awaiting surgical intervention.</p><p>Some studies addressed cardiovascular surgeries as a whole; a study published in 2008
by Colak et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>, which
analyzed 111 patients in pre and postoperative periods and the health status of the
patients one year after discharge, showed a statistically significant improvement,
and the group of high-risk patients had the best benefit (EuroSCORE 6). Koch et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>, in a study of
5581 patients, demonstrated that a lower socioeconomic status of the patient is
associated with a lower QoL, while Noyez et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> concluded that QoL in cardiovascular surgery is
overestimated, certainly for the elderly and those patients with preoperative low
QoL.</p><p>Several authors, as described above, have already performed studies about the QoL
assessment in the postoperative period of cardiovascular surgery, but a Brazilian
study with a questionnaire created in Brazil, adapted to our reality, hasn't been
conducted yet. In addition, this questionnaire was created to facilitate the
acquisition of data, not only via personal contact, but also via telephone. By
facilitating the way to obtain information about QoL, more people may be interested
in using this parameter in the assessment of individuals' health, especially in the
Brazilian context, where research isn't valued and resources are scarce.</p><p>The present study has some limitations. The first, it is a cross-sectional analysis
of a cohort. This was done only for the QLCS questionnaire's initial validation, the
work with longitudinal analysis of the patients is already being elaborated and the
test-retest reliability will be made. The second, it is an unicentric study. On the
other hand, once validated, we hope that many other scientific centers can take
advantage of this questionnaire. The third refers to the limited number of patients,
however, because it is a prospective study using the CEDREC registry, which began in
June 2016, it was not possible to recruit a larger sample. Still, it was enough to
perform the internal validation of the questionnaire, since only 63 patients were
required. A fourth limitation is the possible bias associated with any questionnaire
conducted via telephone. But it was created to be simpler and more objective to
reduce this bias, and all phone calls were made by the same researcher. A fifth
limitation could be the fact that we haven't chosen to create stricter exclusion
criteria, excluding patients with lung diseases or neurodegenerative diseases. The
QoL of these individuals would be invariably affected by these other conditions, and
the insertion of these patients could provide a bias for the misunderstanding of
adequately representing the impact of cardiovascular surgery on QoL. However, this
could be done in a future research.</p><p>Finally, this is only the first validation step of this questionnaire, which presents
adequate internal consistency. Subsequent steps will be performed to ensure the
adequate use in the clinical practice of postoperative cardiovascular surgery
patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The QLCS questionnaire is probably a good tool for the evaluation of QoL in the
postoperative period of cardiovascular surgery, with adequate internal consistency,
besides being an easy-to-apply instrument, which can even be done via telephone. The
presence of chest pain, incision pain, and shortness of breath seems to be related
to QoL, making it worse, while return to physical activity seems to improve QoL.</p><table-wrap id="t5" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="50%" span="1"/><col width="50%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MMKB</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Substantial contributions to the conception or design

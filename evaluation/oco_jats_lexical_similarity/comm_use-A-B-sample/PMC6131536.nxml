As an important medium for signal communication, exosomes can transfer important information, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), from donors to receptors. MiRNAs are known to fine-tune a variety of biological processes, including maxillofacial development; however, the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. In the present study, transient apoptosis was found to be due to the expression of a miniature swine maxillofacial-specific miRNA, ssc-mir-133b. Upregulation of ssc-mir-133b resulted in robust apoptosis in primary dental mesenchymal cells in the maxillofacial region. Cell leukemia myeloid 1 (Mcl-1) was verified as the functional target, which triggered further downstream activation of endogenous mitochondria-related apoptotic processes during tooth development. More importantly, mandible exosomes were responsible for the initial apoptosis signal. An animal study demonstrated that ectopic expression of ssc-mir-133b resulted in failed tooth formation after 12 weeks of subcutaneous transplantation in nude mice. The tooth germ developed abnormally without the indispensable exosomal signals from the mandible.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="LongSummary"><title>Tooth development: special delivery from the mandible</title><p id="Par2">The delivery of the small regulatory molecule microRNA-133b via extracellular vesicles released from the lower jaw is required for tooth formation in pigs and mice. Several microRNAs have been implicated in tooth development, but their precise roles are poorly understood. Songlin Wang at Capital Medical University, China, and colleagues found that microRNA-133b causes temporary cell death at sites of molar development by reducing the levels of the pro-survival protein myeloid cell leukemia-1. Moreover, they showed that microRNA-133b is delivered from the lower jaw in exosomes and that interrupting this signal prevents tooth development. These findings highlight the importance of cross-talk between jaw and tooth tissue for normal development and reveal a possible mechanism for the prevention and treatment of abnormal tooth formation.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science Foundation of China)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>No. 81701037</award-id><award-id>No. 81371108, 81670955</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Ye</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Normally developed organs are the result of the accurate spatiotemporal expression of related genes and appropriate signals &#x0201c;talking&#x0201d; between donors and receptors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> Maxillofacial development is a complex process because different tissues and organs are involved.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> Teeth and the mandible are functionally and locally related tissues in the maxillofacial region, as they are adjacent to one another and disruptions that affect the mandible also negatively affect dental patterning during development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> Cross-talk between the teeth and mandible are crucially important for maintaining the normal development of both tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup></p><p id="Par4">As a newly discovered player in tissue and organ cross-talk, exosomes play important roles in diverse biological processes, such as tissue growth, organ development, and body immune regulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> The basis of exosome signal transduction is the multiple signaling molecules contained therein, among which microRNAs (miRNAs) have attracted the most attention in recent years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> Exosomes can transfer miRNA information from donor to recipient cells, regulating the biological functions of the recipient cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup></p><p id="Par5">MiRNAs are known to be involved in the regulation of many important biological processes, including maxillofacial development.

Many apoptotic cells were located in the mesenchyme and enamel knots in the E40 and E50 premolars (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), which also showed expression of ssc-mir-133b. However, the apoptosis signal was almost invisible in the E60 premolar. Because a transient apoptotic signal was found in the ssc-mir-133b expression region, we hypothesized that the expression of ssc-mir-133b might be closely related to the apoptotic regulation of tooth development during this period. Additionally, since ssc-mir-133b was mainly expressed in premolar primary dental mesenchymal cells, these cells were selected to validate the role of ssc-mir-133b in the subsequent study. Lentivirus transfection was performed with neg-miR and miR-133b expression vectors and the most effective multiplicity of infection (MOI) value was determined by real-time PCR. For both the miR-133b overexpression and inhibition vectors, an MOI of 5 was chosen as the most effective transfection MOI (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, up). Moreover, the miR-133b expression vector was used to transfect tooth germs, and the effect of transfection is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref> (bottom).

The bioinformatics data identified several apoptosis-related genes (such as Bcorl-1, Bcl2l-1, Bcl2l-2, Mcl-1, Bnop3l) as putative miR-133b target genes. However, when miR-133b was overexpressed in premolar primary dental mesenchymal cells, Mcl-1 was the only gene that was downregulated. Mcl-1 is a critical anti-apoptotic gene in Bcl-2-related apoptosis, and aberrant Mcl-1 expression may lead to abnormal apoptosis. Interestingly, in situ hybridization results in the present study showed that Mcl-1 had the same expression pattern as ssc-mir-133b in early tooth development, and more specifically in E40, E50, and E60 premolars (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Therefore, Mcl-1 may be the ssc-mir-133b target gene that is involved in tooth development. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, Mcl-1 had a conserved ssc-mir-133b binding site in the structure of its 3&#x02032;-untranslated region (UTR). To validate the regulatory role of ssc-mir-133b on Mcl-1, we cloned the wild-type Mcl-1 3&#x02032;-UTR that contained the binding sites for ssc-mir-133b and a mutated version into the luciferase reporter plasmid pmir-glo (Promega, American). The cloned plasmids were co-transfected with ssc-mir-133b mimics and inhibitors separately in 293&#x02009;T cells.

In the wild-type Mcl-1 3&#x02032;-UTR group, ssc-mir-133b suppressed approximately 50% of the luciferase activity, whereas luciferase activity was not affected in the mutant Mcl-1 3&#x02032;-UTR group. Moreover, the ssc-mir-133b inhibitor substantially restored the luciferase activity of the wild-type Mcl-1 3&#x02032;-UTR, whereas no significant change was found in the mutant Mcl-1 3&#x02032;-UTR (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>).

By day E35 of embryonic development, weak apoptotic signals were detected in the dental mesenchyme (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Additionally, strong ssc-mir-133b expression was found in the E30, E35, E40, and E50 mandibles (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that during tooth germ development, the mandible transmits apoptotic signals to the tooth germs and further regulates their development. To confirm this hypothesis, we separately isolated mandible and tooth germs from miniature swine at E35. Additionally, mandible exosomes were isolated and characterized (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). Mandibles showed robust ssc-mir-133b expression compared with the tooth germ, and exosomes from the mandible showed a similar ssc-mir-133b expression pattern compared with the tooth germ (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d, e</xref>). As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f, g</xref>, when co-cultured with the mandible in a Transwell system, the tooth germ showed upregulated ssc-mir-133b expression. When ssc-mir-133b was inhibited in the mandible, co-culture of both tissues did not change the expression levels in the tooth germ. Exosomes were isolated after 72&#x02009;h of mandible in vitro culture, and tooth germ ssc-mir-133b was upregulated when co-cultured with exosomes from the mandible. When an inhibitor of exosomes, GW4869, was added as a control, the expression of ssc-mir-133b in the tooth germ was not upregulated.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>The mandible regulated tooth germ development through exosome-transferred ssc-mir-133b. <bold>a</bold> Apoptosis was measured with a TUNEL assay in E30 and E35 mandibles.

More importantly, the mandible is the origin of the initial signal and sends the apoptotic order to the tooth through exosomes to regulate normal tooth formation. We confirmed that mandible exosome-transmitted ssc-mir-133b can mediate the endogenous mitochondria-related apoptotic process during premolar development.</p><p id="Par15">The specific spatiotemporal expression of particular genes is crucial for normal development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> Therefore, the expression pattern of ssc-mir-133b in tooth germ was first investigated. Ssc-mir-133b was mainly expressed in the dental mesenchyme during the early stages of development, which indicated a regulatory role in the dental mesenchyme. Additionally, ssc-mir-133b expression was visible in the enamel knot, which is the center of tooth development,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> suggesting its crucial role in normal tooth development.</p><p id="Par16">The present study demonstrated that ssc-mir-133b was highly related to apoptosis in the early stages of premolar development.

From the present data, we hypothesized that ssc-mir-133b is spatiotemporally expressed during tooth morphogenesis as an effector to help remove unwanted cells in tooth germs to form a tooth with normal morphogenesis.</p><p id="Par17">In the current study, Mcl-1 was confirmed as the downstream target of ssc-mir-133b that regulates tooth development during the early stages. During embryonic development, Mcl-1 is expressed in a wide variety of tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> However, its role in tooth development has rarely been reported. Mcl-1 can be transcriptionally and translationally controlled by staurosporine and aspirin, as well as by non-coding RNAs, which revealed the diversity in its regulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> The co-localization of ssc-mir-133b and Mcl-1 together with the direct combination of both in the present research strongly suggested that ssc-mir-133b could directly regulate cell apoptosis through Mcl-1 during the early stage of tooth development, thus maintaining the normal tooth morphogenesis of miniature swine.</p><p id="Par18">Mitochondria are organelles that coordinate caspase activation during apoptosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup> The permeable outer mitochondrial membrane allows for cytochrome c release by integrating death signals from Bcl-2 family members, such as Mcl-1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> Overexpression of ssc-mir-133b destroyed the mitochondrial membrane potential and upregulated the levels of caspase-3, caspace-7, and caspace-9 through the downregulation of Mcl-1, which suggested that ssc-mir-133b regulated tooth morphogenesis through endogenous mitochondria-related apoptotic processes.</p><p id="Par19">In the current study, we observed that the mandible is the donor of ssc-mir-133b/Mcl-1 signaling in tooth germs during early development. More importantly, exosomes mediated this process. Recent studies have demonstrated that exosomes are predominantly endosomal in origin and contain a cargo of miRNAs, mRNAs, and proteins that are transferred from their original cells to target cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup> Exosomes are released into the extracellular environment and interact with recipient cells via three pathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup> They may enter cells via endocytic uptake or by direct fusion of the vesicles to the cell membrane. They may also transmit their contents through adhesion to the cell surface mediated by the interaction of a lipid&#x02013;ligand receptor. These interactions indicate that exosomes possess pivotal roles in cell-to-cell communication in different physiological and pathological conditions. During development, cells communicate with one another to achieve coordinated tissue patterning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup> Signals are sent and received to regulate internal activities. In our case, exosomes from the mandible regulated the related process of tooth development through miRNAs. We isolated RNA from the mandible, mandible exosomes, and tooth germs to detect the expression of ssc-mir-133b and found that its expression in tooth germs was highly related to co-culture with mandible or mandible exosomes, which indicates that the regulation of tooth development is due to the cross-talk between the mandible and tooth germs. When exosomes were inhibited by GW4869, ssc-mir-133b/Mcl-1 regulation in the tooth germ was correspondingly inhibited.</p><p id="Par20">In the present animal study, we found that overexpression of ssc-mir-133b in tooth germs could lead to failure of premolar formation. To date, little evidence has been found to indicate the key apoptotic molecules involved in tooth development. Msx-2, eda, and p21 have been reportedly correlated with cell death in odontogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup> Mutations in these genes result in tooth agenesis. The loss of Mcl-1 expression leads to tooth formation failure, suggesting that Mcl-1 may be another candidate pathogenic gene related to tooth agenesis. Additionally, loss of exosome secretion leads to abnormal tooth formation during tooth germ development, indicating that exosomes are indispensable mediators in maxillofacial development.</p><p id="Par21">In conclusion, the existing data in the present study indicated that the mandible secretes exosomal ssc-mir-133b to the developing tooth to regulate its morphogenesis. Physiological ssc-mir-133b/Mcl-1 levels are critical for maintaining normal tooth development. By targeting Mcl-1, ssc-mir-133b activates apoptotic signals in developing dental mesenchyme, resulting in endogenous mitochondria-related apoptosis, which eventually regulates morphogenesis in the formation of premolars (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Schematic of mandible exosomal ssc-mir-133b regulation in tooth morphogenesis.

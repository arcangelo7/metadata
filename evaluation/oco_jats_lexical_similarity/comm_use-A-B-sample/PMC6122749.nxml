vomiting occurring for the first 24-48 hours after surgery in inpatients. The
incidence of PONV is about 30% in all post-surgical patients and up to 80% in
high-risk patients, it is one of the most common causes of patient dissatisfaction
after anesthesia<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.
The physiology of PONV is complex and not perfectly understood. The brain structures
involved in the pathophysiology of vomiting are distributed throughout the medulla
oblongata of the brainstem, not centralized in an anatomically defined center of
vomiting<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.
Regarding PONV, enterochromaffin cells in the stomach and intestine release
serotonin, which binds to 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT<sub>3</sub>) receptors in
the gastrointestinal tract? This binding will lead to stimulation of vagal afferents
in the gastrointestinal tract that conduct impulses reaching brainstem structures
located between the obex levels and the nucleus ambiguus, such as the area postrema.
Located on the dorsal surface of the medulla oblongata at the caudal end of the
fourth ventricle, the area postrema has a critical role in the central mechanism of
vomiting<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.
Neurotransmitter receptor systems involved in mediating signals leading to nausea
and vomiting include dopaminergic (D<sub>2</sub>), cholinergic (muscarinic),
histaminergic (H<sub>1</sub>) serotonergic (5-HT<sub>3</sub>), and neurokinin NK1
systems. The corresponding receptors are potential targets for antiemetic drugs.
Even if the numerous neurochemicals involved in the neurocircuitry of emesis may not
have been fully identified, the two main inputs to the central pattern generator are
from the abdominal vagal afferents via the nucleus tractus
solitarius<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>
and from the chemoceptive trigger zone located in the area
postrema<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>While studies of PONV have concentrated on non&#x02010;cardiac surgical
procedures<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>, limited data suggest that
the incidence of PONV in patients undergoing cardiac surgery may be as high as
45-50%<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Fast-track cardiac anesthesia (FTCA) is a perioperative anesthetic management that
aims to facilitate tracheal extubation of patients within 1-6 hours after cardiac
surgery. Most centers consider fast-track extubation up to 8-10 hours after
surgery<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of PONV after FTCA in the first
24-48 hours in the cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) after open-heart surgery, risk
factors for PONV and its influence on CICU length of stay.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>In this prospective observational study, we collected data from 300 patients
undergoing open-heart surgery from two cardiac centers, Princess Muna Al-Hussein
Cardiac Center, King Abdullah University Hospital in the North of Jordan and Queen
Alia Heart Institute, Royal Medical Services, Amman, Jordan, over a three years
period from the January 1, 2013 to the end of December 2015. These patients
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting, valve replacement or combined procedures
with FTCA. We did not lose any patients involved in this study, as the mortality was
excluded at the beginning of our study. Tracheal extubation performed within 6-10
hours in the CICU when patients were conscious, oriented, with stable hemodynamic
status and no bleeding. We did not use routinely nasogastric tube insertion, neither
prophylactic antiemetic drug. After completion of surgery, patients were transferred
to the CICU, where inotropic, vasodilatory agents were started depending on their
hemodynamic status. A light heater was used to ensure the normothermic temperature
of the patient. Propofol was immediately used for postoperative sedation (1-4
mg/kg/h) in the first 3 hours, then stopped as spontaneous breathing test and to
improve the patient's level of consciousness. After that, analgesia was provided by
intermittent boluses according to the patient's condition using low doses of
intravenous (IV) morphine (5-15 mg). After 48 hours, we are usually used paracetamol
(1 g) IV as analgesia every 6 hours. When patients still complained of severe pain,
we used oral tramadol 100 mg tablet(s) twice a day if there was no renal
dysfunction, history of peptic ulcer or history of bronchial asthma. The patients
were discharged from CICU after 3-4 days, as we do not have a telemetry monitor in
the general cardiac ward.</p><p>Preoperative (<xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), postoperative and CICU
length of stay data (<xref rid="t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) were collected.

infusion (0.05-2 &#x000b5;g/kg/min) + propofol infusion (50-100 &#x000b5;g/kg/min)
+ isoflurane (1-2%) or sevoflurane (2-2.5%) for maintenance of anaesthesia.
Pharmacological reversal of neuromuscular blockade was not used. Mechanical
ventilation was performed through a closed circuit with a tidal volume of 7
mL/kg. Along with the standard ASA monitors (pulse oximetry, electrocardiogram,
capnography and nasopharyngeal temperature probe), all patients had an arterial
line, central venous line, urinary bladder catheter. Frequent laboratory values
for arterial blood gases, blood sugar, hematocrit and electrolytes were
obtained. Chest X-ray and echocardiography were done routinely before
surgery.</p><p>The record of any episodes of nausea, retching or vomiting was started by CICU
nurses immediately after extubation and hourly until the end of 48 hours of CICU
stay. Because of the fact that retching is similar to vomiting in all aspects
except the production of vomitus<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>, both were considered as vomiting in the study.
Metoclopramide (Plasil) 10 mg IV as antiemetic drug was initially prescribed for
all patients by an attending cardiac resident. When there was no response to
metoclopramide up to 1 hour and patients still complained of nausea or vomiting,
then ondansetron (Zofran) 4 mg IV was prescribed. We did not notice any
extrapyramidal symptoms or any other adverse reaction from metoclopramide, and
this may be due to irregular use of the drug (single-used, as a single-dose when
needed) and not a routine prescription as a regular prophylactic, even with the
use of ondansetron. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social
Sciences (SPSS, IBM version 20) and were described using percentages. The
differences between percentages were analyzed by the chi-square test. A

from anaesthesia. There is little information on the incidence or management of
nausea and vomiting after cardiac surgery although most studies about PONV have
concentrated frequently on women undergoing gynaecological
procedures<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>After cardiac surgery, intestinal mucosal hypoperfusion is common and is a known
factor that explains the high associated incidence of postoperative nausea and
vomiting<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the expansion of
plasma volume during cardiac surgery is associated with the maintenance of
intestinal perfusion and reduction of postoperative morbidity, including persistence
of nausea and vomiting<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Several hypotheses about the cause of PONV are possible, including prolonged surgery,
a large amount of preoperative opioids, and intestinal hypoperfusion in patients
without prolonged sedation<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Lerman<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> has
suggested that the incidence of PONV is approximately 2-3 times greater in women
than in men. Women have a 2- to 3-fold greater incidence of PONV than men. This is
attributed to increased levels of estrogen, gonadotropin, and plasma
progesterone<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>. Administration of
antiemetic drugs to prevent PONV after surgery can be used during, before or after
surgery, or to treat well-established PONV. This latter approach is a satisfactory
option for patients undergoing surgical procedures with a low frequency of PONV,
such as FTCA<sup>[<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>.
Although it still provides reasonable control of emesis, the strategy of
administering antiemetics as needed may be useful to avoid routine prophylactic
administration and avoid the side effects and cost of unneeded antiemetic
therapy<sup>[<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>.
The role of prophylaxis for PONV in cardiac surgery is still a subject of
debate<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>.
In our practice, we do not use prophylactic antiemetic drugs. The control of emesis
by the administration of antiemetic drugs when necessary after extubation in our
practice may be the cause of not noticing any extrapyramidal symptoms or any other
adverse reaction of metoclopramide or ondansetron. The previous study by Grebenik
and Allman<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> and
Woodwarg et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>
have previously reported a 46-49% incidence of nausea and 37-42% incidence of
vomiting in their patients after cardiac surgery. In our study, the incidence of
PONV was considerably lower in comparison with their study. This may be related to
our anaesthetic protocol, low doses of fentanyl (10-15 &#x000b5;g/kg) and relatively
low doses of morphine (5-15 mg) during the postoperative period. Rafiq et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>, in
their prospective randomized controlled trial evaluating whether a multimodal opioid
sparing regimen of dexamethasone, gabapentin, ibuprofen and paracetamol had better
analgesic effect, fewer side effects and was safe compared to a traditional regimen
of morphine and paracetamol after cardiac surgery. They concluded that, in patients
undergoing cardiac surgery, a multimodal regimen offered significantly better
analgesia than a traditional opiate regimen. Complaints of nausea and vomiting were
significantly reduced. No safety issues were observed with the multimodal regimen.
In our study, we observed a relatively low incidence of PONV with single regimen,
our anaesthetic protocol was relatively well followed, using low dose of morphine
(5-15 mg) during the postoperative period, safely and without complications. The
argument against the use of prophylaxis may be due to the fact that droperidol and
ondansetron may be associated with cardiac arrhythmias<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>. The use of prophylaxis,
as we mentioned before for PONV in cardiac surgery, is up for debate, following a
report from a study showing a considerably lower prevalence of nausea (19.7%) and
vomiting (4.3%) after cardiac surgery with fast-track anesthesia when effective
rescue treatment was implemented, leading the authors to discourage the use of
prophylaxis<sup>[<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The Cochrane database systematic reviews, by Wong et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup>, sought to determine the
safety and effectiveness of fast-track cardiac care compared with conventional (not
fast-track) care in adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Fast-track cardiac
care intervention includes the administration of low-dose opioid-based general
anaesthesia or the use of a time-directed extubation protocol, or both. This is an
update of a Cochrane review first published in 2003<sup>[<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup>, updated in
2012<sup>[<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> and
updated again in 2016<sup>[<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>They searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015,
Issue 5), MEDLINE (January 2012 to May 2015), Embase (January 2012 to May 2015), the
Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; January 2012 to
May 2015) and the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science (January
2012 to May 2015), along with reference lists of articles to identify additional
trials. They did not apply language restrictions. Their analysis of the Cochrane
database systematic reviews included all randomized controlled trials of adult
cardiac surgical patients (coronary artery bypass grafts, aortic valve replacement,
mitral valve replacement) that compared fast-track cardiac care and conventional
(not fast-track) care groups. They focused on the following fast-track
interventions, which were designed for early extubation after surgery:
administration of low-dose opioid-based general anaesthesia during cardiac surgery
and use of a time-directed extubation protocol after surgery. The primary outcome
was a mortality risk. Secondary outcomes included postoperative complications,
reintubation within 24 hours of surgery, time to extubation, length of stay in the
intensive care unit and in the hospital, quality of life after surgery and hospital
costs. They concluded that low-dose opioid-based general anaesthesia and
time-directed extubation protocols for fast-track interventions have mortality risks
and major postoperative complications similar to those of conventional (not
fast-track) care, and therefore appear to be safe for use in low- to moderate-risk
patients. These fast-track interventions reduced time to extubation and shortened
the length of stay in the intensive care unit, but did not reduce the length of stay
in the hospital.</p><p>A specific PONV risk assessment tool may be useful for predicting those at higher
risk after cardiac surgery. Further research is required to identify strategies to
reduce PONV<sup>[<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup>.</p><sec><title>Limitation of the Study</title><p>Although this is a prospective observational study of two cardiac centers with
the same anesthetic protocol, a prospective, randomized, double-blind study with
single-center experience, involving a greater number of patients with a
standardized anesthetic protocol, even with different surgeons, will be more
valuable and we think will be of value to consider a prophylactic approach
beside side effects and costs, taking into account the patient satisfaction. It
will be of value to test groups of patients of different age and sex, in a
randomized double-blind study involving both groups of patients younger than 60
years of age, male and female, with groups of patients over 60 years old.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In our study, the incidence of PONV is relatively low after cardiac anesthesia. We
found that female patients, younger than 60 years, were more likely to develop
postoperative nausea and vomiting, and did not prolong CICU stay. Control of emesis

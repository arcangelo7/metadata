the clinical practice of the Brazilian medicine occur with some immense delay behind the
so-called first world countries. There are several reasons for that, ranging from the
bureaucracy of the registration and import processes to the issues related to exchange
differences - leveraged in recent months, passing through voracious federal, state and
local taxation, as well as the recurring economic limitation of health funding
institutions, in other words, the National Health System and health insurances
companies, besides the natural learning process of professionals, usually physicians,
who use these technologies in the daily treatment. Inevitably, we are always lagging
behind of what happens in Europe and the United States. Worse than that is to see that
our neighbors, with much weaker economies than ours, can incorporate these technologies
with greater ease, making us reflect: Why insist on this archaic and retrograde
model?</p><p>There was a panel with the same title as this article on October 23, 2015, promoted by
Hospital Brasilia, Distrito Federal, ending the 1<sup>st</sup> Advanced Heart Failure
and Circulatory Assistance Symposium. Hospitals, health insurance company managers,
industry representatives of hospital medical equipment, government, the Federal Council
of Medicine, the Judiciary, and of course, physicians who daily face the dilemma of
knowing that they can always offer a little more, in light of what is already in
operation in the world, but are hampered by bureaucracy, budget constraints, and even a
certain amount of ignorance and inefficiency.</p><p>The debate could be directed to any area of Medicine. In all, I am sure, dilemmas,
problems and complaints resound with equal intensity. Since it is a specific event, we
focused the discussion on the current wave of incorporation and the use of circulatory
support devices. In fact, it is important to emphasize that the current methods for us
have already been routine for other nations for decades. See the example of
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig.
1</xref>), incorporated into clinical practice about 40 years ago and still gets in our
country the stamp of "experimental technique". This label is not given exclusively by
the health insurance companies or even by the National Health System, with its
well-known and alleged financial needs. We were appalled, when the Federal Council of
Medicine gives a six-line opinion without any biographical source that gives them
protection, saying that is an experimental procedure. On the other hand, we note that,
despite this, the ANVISA (Brazilian Health Surveillance Agency) and the ANS (National
Regulatory Agency for Private Health Insurance and Plans), respectively, authorized the
incorporation of this technology in the country and put on the list of approved medical
procedures for clinical use. The international and even national guidelines, some of
them still "in process", recognize and define the criteria for recommendations and
management of such equipment. Even then, the Federal Council of Medicine still considers
it an "experimental technique".</p><p>

</p><p>Backed up by the medical knowledge built and assimilated over decades, I, as a doctor, am
able to recommend and perform a widely supported procedure, but I may be accused of
doing tests on human guinea pigs through the eyes of those who interpret and guard the
Code of Medical Ethics. What to do? Should I give up on everything or run the risk of
staining my unblemished career? Many of us are faced with this same conflict and
fear.</p><p>More than a simple drama of consciousness, this dilemma ends up favoring those who, for
financial reasons, hamper the development of the honorable "art of healing". I do not
want to belittle or relegate the costs of incorporating these and other technologies. It
is worth remembering that the final costs involving such equipments, most of the times,
are higher when compared to the costs practiced in Europe and the USA. Do not tell me
that this is due exclusively to the exchange-taxes binomial. We all have witnessed that
the action of some bad professionals contribute to the price increase and non-viability
of these technologies. However, supported in alleged technical opinions, the right to
life is denied to those individuals who could take advantage of this primary
legislation.</p><p>On the other hand, hospitals that try to put themselves at the forefront of this
technological incorporation collide with successive negative responses from the
institutions, and frequently, succumb to reality and avoid the quixotic confrontation.
After all, many other legitimate interests are at stake.</p><p>In a scenario where the characters involved in the health system do not get along, that
it is, the most fragile one that would be the direct beneficiary of new technologies -
the patient, needs the aid of justice. The big problem is that justice does not
understand anything about the subject and is put in the condition to arbitrate disputes
and demands that never stop coming. How can someone without the minimum technical and
scientific insight decide on such delicate and risky issues? Well, we delegate the
guidelines and decisions to lay people. It happens because we are incapable of talking
it over and jointly define the criteria for these incorporating technologies occur. But
who should have the initiative to start the dialogue and reconciliation? Medical
associations, health institutions or the government? It does not matter. If the
willingness for dialogue, common sense and the interest to do something new do not
permeate the behavior of these characters, nothing will happen. We could give the
government the role to lead this great discussion, something that has never happened
before. Of course we could, but the immobility of the Brazilian state at this time
prevents simple and elementary actions from being put into action.</p><p>In broad terms, this was the synthesis of a nearly two-hour debate, which maintained the
high level of information and respect. A debate that deserves and needs to be held in
other scientific meetings as a way to clarify and especially raise awareness that
medical science itself is not enough. It is supported especially in social science,
where the contradictory factors and reconciliations are the mainspring for the
scientific update, the constant search for quality of care we want, can and must provide
with respect, knowledge and maturity.</p><sig-block><sig><bold>Helmgton Souza - MD, PhD, UNIFESP-EPM,</bold> Coordinator of the Advanced

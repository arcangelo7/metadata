the Revista Brasileira de Cirurgia Cardiovascular, known today as the Brazilian Journal
of Cardiovascular Surgery (BJCVS).</p><p>These 30 years represent the history of our Society.</p><p>The journal was founded by idealists led by Dr. Adib Jatene, and they represent the
pioneers of cardiac surgery in Brazil and South America.</p><p>Professor Adib was the Editor-in-Chief for the first 10 years, from 1986 to 1996.</p><p>Our current President followed in his footsteps, showing his permanent dedication to the
Brazilian Society of Cardiovascular Surgery (BSCVS).</p><p>Prof. Fabio Jatene was the Editor-in-Chief during 6 years, from 1996 to 2002.</p><p>In 2002, I put myself at disposal and I have been the Editor-in-chief since then.</p><p>Due to our growth and complexity, our Associated Editors currently play a bigger role, in
which they are responsible for the entire process of dealing with the articles they are
attributed. The Editor-in-Chief still has the final word.</p><p>Space limitations do not allow me to name every single person that has worked, without
pay or advantage, for the greater good of the BJCVS.</p><p>I ask all the coleagues to access at the journal's webpage at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bjcvs.org">www.bjcvs.org</ext-link>, in
the "Editorial Board" session to see the names of those who throughout our history have
gone to great lengths to create and maintain the BJCVS and that is why they deserve to
be praised by all.</p><p>In addition, at the end of every issue, all our reviewers are listed, to whom I pay
tribute for sacrificing their leisure time not only to review the manuscripts, but
especially to guide the authors who show potential, helping them conform to scientific
methods, to the guidelines of the journal and standard language, thereby acting as
professors.</p><p>This kind of attitude has gradually improved the level of our publications, though we
still have to improve our work.</p><p>Changing the name of the journal on its 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary was a difficult
decision, but a necessary one in order to meet the needs of a new international
reality.</p><p>Nowadays, English is the lingua franca of scientific communication.</p><p>We could not be tied down by nostalgia, remaining unread and not understood by the
international community.</p><p>You are witness to the care we took to make this transition.</p><p>First, as required by SciELO, PubMed etc., the abstract was published in Portuguese and
English.</p><p>Then, for a long time, we became a bilingual publication, which was very interesting, but
also a demanding job since for every issue we actually published two "journals", one in
Portuguese and the other in English.</p><p>The titles of the articles continued in Portuguese for some time, until we decided to
publish them in English to call the attention of readers who did not understand our
language.</p><p>We also modified our submission system, which became fully in English to make it easier
for researchers from other countries.</p><p>Such measures had some effect as we have received articles from Portugal, Colombia,
United States, Canada, Germany, Iraq, Iran, Mexico (where we are in a Portal similar to
SciELO), and many from China and Turkey, but not enough to increase our citations and
Impact Factor, which is now our main goal.</p><p>We are in almost all international databases, allowing easy access to our articles, which
is essential to attract readers, especially because our journal is completely free, both
for authors and readers.</p><p>The change in our designation to English required several d&#x000e9;marches, both in
Brazil and abroad.</p><p>Finally, it became a reality, primarily because we had had the designation in English as
a subtitle for a long time!</p><p>Another question arose: whether to completely change our identity and remove the word
"Brazilian", following in the footsteps of many other publications that do not identify
their country of origin.</p><p>Many people helped us with this task, Professor Abel Packer, Director of SciELO, being
one of them, who insisted we should not lose our national identity.</p><p>I believe it was a wise decision. Brazil is much greater than the crises it faces. It is
essential to show what we are capable of in order to stand amidst other nations.</p><p>Among the advantages of producing our issues in only one language, there was an important
byproduct: we went from quarterly to bimonthly publication, that is, six issues per
year.</p><p>I would like to call your attention to an important fact: every economic sacrifice has
been made, but the new changes will have been in vain unless we publish work of proven
scientific value.</p><p>Dear colleagues, I ask you to ponder these terms. We have a modern tool in accordance
with global standards; however, we will not fall within the scope of leading
publications if our articles are mediocre.</p><p>Our constant obsession with having a better impact factor and, as a result, a Qualis
ranking compatible with our specialty, will suffer another drawback: due to the change
of name, the BJCVS citation will be only in English and thereby counted by Thomson and
Scopus from now on. These are problems to be faced in order to improve for the
future.</p><sec><title>ARTICLES</title><p>In this issue, there are 13 articles, six originals, three reviews, one
clinical-surgical correlation, one brief communication, one experimental work, and a
letter to the editor.</p><p>Among these articles, we have four international studies - Transposition of Great
Arteries with Intramural Coronary Artery: Experience with a Modified Surgical
Technique (page 15), from India; Comparison of Transcatheter Aortic Valve
Implantation <italic>versus</italic> Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement to Improve
Quality of Life in Patients &#x0003e;70 Years of Age with Severe Aortic Stenosis (page
1), from Turkey; and Aberrant Origin of Vertebral Artery and its Clinical
Implications (page 52) and Myocardial Bridging (page 60), from China.</p></sec><sec><title>CME</title><p>In this BJCVS issue, the following articles are available to test the Continuing
Medical Education (CME): "Results of Open and Endovascular Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm
Repair According to the E-PASS Score" (page 22); "Congenital Heart Disease and
Impacts on Child Development" (page 31); and "Double Aortic Arch Associated with
Pulmonary Atresia with Ventricular Septal Defect" (page 63)</p></sec><sec><title>BJCVS 30 YEARS</title><p>It is with great joy that we also publish reviews celebrating our 30<sup>th</sup>
anniversary, written with warmth by the following colleagues:</p><p>Marcela da Cunha Sales, "The Evolution of Cardiac Surgery in Brazil and the BJCVS"
(page 74); Vinicius Jos&#x000e9; da Silva Nina, "The 30<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of
the Brazilian Journal of Cardiovascular Surgery" (page 75); Rubens Tofano de Barros,
"BJCVS: A Success Story" (page 77); Milton de Miranda Santoro, "The Myth of Atlas"
(page 78); and Luiz C&#x000e9;sar Guarita-Souza, "The Thirty Years of the Brazilian
Journal of Cardiovascular Surgery" (page 79).</p><p>In the next issues, we wish to have many more descriptions of the history of the
Brazilian cardiovascular surgery, including the BJCVS.</p></sec><sec><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</title><p>Among all the changes we have been through, there is one more: the resignation of
Ricardo Brandau Quitete, who throughout the last 13 years helped us shape the
profile of the journal. That is how life is, things change and we have to change
along. All BSCVS partners and I can only thank Brandau for his dedication and work
and wish him success in the new challenges to come.</p></sec><sec><title>43<sup>rd</sup> BRAZILIAN CONGRESS OF CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY</title><p>From April 7 to 9, the 43<sup>rd</sup> Brazilian Congress of Cardiovascular Surgery
will take place at Centro de Eventos do Cear&#x000e1; in Fortaleza, CE.</p><p>Besides the scientific program, containing innovations that make it an all-around
event, on par with similar international events, this year the Congress will mark
the celebration of the 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the BJCVS.</p><p>This year's theme is "Innovation, New Horizons in Cardiovascular Surgery".</p><p>At the same time, the 6<sup>th</sup> Symposium of Nursing in Cardiovascular Surgery,
the 6<sup>th</sup> Symposium of Physiotherapy in Cardiovascular Surgery, the
5<sup>th</sup> Academic Congress in Cardiovascular Surgery, the 34<sup>th</sup>
Brazilian Congress of Cardiopulmonary Bypass, the Female Surgeons Meeting, and the
Residents Meeting will take place.</p><p>With the purpose of discussing the most recent advances in surgical techniques and
the incorporation of new technology, we will have important international
guests.</p><p>The presence of several international guests consolidates the growth and fundamental
integration of BSCVS with international Societies and values the essential exchange
of knowledge. In addition, participants will enjoy moments with colleagues and
family as well as leisure time visiting the beautiful capital of Cear&#x000e1;.</p><p>I congratulate the Board of the BSCVS and the Organizing Committee, coordinated by
Dr. Glauco Lobo, on the effort made so that the scientific program was interesting
for all the Congress participants.</p><p>On April 8<sup>th</sup>, from 10am to 12pm in Auditorium 7, there will be a meeting
of the Editorial Board of the BJCVS with Associate Editors and Editorial Board
members, also open to all members. We will address very strongly the issues that I
mentioned above and it will be of great importance to have all suggestions and
criticisms in this transitional phase, so that we can improve the journal and make
it in accordance with the requirements of all Databases and aspiration of our
readers around the globe.</p><p>Warm regards,</p></sec><sig-block><sig>Domingo M. Braile<break/>Editor-in-Chief - BJCVS</sig></sig-block></body></article>

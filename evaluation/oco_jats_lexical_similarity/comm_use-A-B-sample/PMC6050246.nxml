Here, we report that the cilia of nucleus pulposus (NP) cells mediate mechanotransduction to maintain anabolic activity in the discs. We found that mechanical stress promotes transport of parathyroid hormone 1 receptor (PTH1R) to the cilia and enhances parathyroid hormone (PTH) signaling in NP cells. PTH induces transcription of integrin &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>6</sub> to activate the transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b2;-connective tissue growth factor (CCN2)-matrix proteins signaling cascade. Intermittent injection of PTH (iPTH) effectively attenuates disc degeneration of aged mice by direct signaling through NP cells, specifically improving intervertebral disc height and volume by increasing levels of TGF-&#x003b2; activity, CCN2, and aggrecan. PTH1R is expressed in both mouse and human NP cells. Importantly, knockout PTH1R or cilia in the NP cells results in significant disc degeneration and blunts the effect of PTH on attenuation of aged discs. Thus, mechanical stress-induced transport of PTH1R to the cilia enhances PTH signaling, which helps maintain intervertebral disc homeostasis, particularly during aging, indicating therapeutic potential of iPTH for DDD.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="LongSummary"><title>Degenerative disc disease: hormone signaling keeps intervertebral core in balance</title><p id="Par2">Sensory structures found in the jelly-like space between spinal discs release a hormone that helps preserve back health in aging mice. Xu Cao from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, USA, and colleagues observed that levels of a critical growth factor declined in the space between adjacent vertebrae as mice aged, and that injecting a naturally occurring hormone that activates this growth factor could attenuate disc degeneration in older animals. The researchers showed, in response to mechanical stresses, receptor proteins that respond to this hormone relocate themselves to particular sensory organelles known as cilia that found within cells of the intervertebral core. That results in elevated hormone signaling&#x02014;and drugs designed to have the same effect could help treat degenerative disc disease, one of the most common causes of chronic back pain.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000009</institution-id><institution>Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, Inc.)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR071432</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Yong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Degenerative disc disease (DDD) is one of the most common musculoskeletal disorders as the leading cause of disability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> Disc degeneration has been detected as early as adolescence, and 60% of people aged 70 years have severe disc degeneration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> Despite the prevalence of DDD, we still have no effective disease-modifying therapy, largely due to our limited knowledge about mechanisms of intervertebral disc homeostasis and degeneration. The cost of the disease is over $100 billion annually in the US alone, more than stroke, respiratory infection, diabetes, coronary artery disease, and rheumatoid disease combined.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> The current treatments are primarily on symptomatic relief from pain through injections, physical therapy, and activity modification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> or surgical intervention, such as disc decompression, spinal fusion, and disc replacement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> These interventions do not halt progression of degeneration nor restore the physiologic disc function.</p><p id="Par4">Intervertebral disc consists of gel-like nucleus pulposus (NP) in the central compartment surrounded by an outer network of collagen as the annulus fibrosus (AF). Its function as pads between vertebral bodies is to absorb axial compressive forces transmitted along the spine while permitting flexibility in bending and twisting. The NP cells of notochordal origin synthesize extracellular matrix (ECM) (primarily proteoglycans and fine collagen type-II fibrils) in response to hydrostatic pressure, whereas cells in AF synthesize mostly collagen type I in response to the deformation in the maintenance of disc homeostasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> During aging, the cell density, proteoglycan, and water content in the disc decreases, especially in the nucleus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> Disc degeneration is a cell-mediated progressive structural failure with accelerated signs of aging, and early degenerative changes are primarily accelerated sign of aging in a structurally intact disc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup></p><p id="Par5">Intervertebral disc cells embedded in the different areas are exposed to wide ranges of mechanical loads. NP cells are located at the center of discs with higher water content and the types of in vivo loading are hydrostatic pressure, as well as compressive load and shear stress due to the swelling properties of NP tissue,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> whereas cells in AF are exposed predominantly to tensile strain. Disc cells are able to sense mechanical stress and transform it into biological signals to maintain homeostasis of intervertebral discs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> This mechanotransduction enables cells to translate different physical forces into biochemical activities in regulation of tissue function, whereas aberrant mechanotransduction often lead to pathological changes or degenerative states.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> The mechanisms of mechanotransduction has been extensively studied in osteoblasts and chondrocytes. The transmembrane calcium ion channels, receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), and integrins appear to mediate mechanotransduction in these cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> However, the knowledge of mechanotransduction in disc cells is rather limited relative to bone and chondrocytes. Certain integrins have been implicated in the compressive loading-induced down-regulation of aggrecan gene expression in human NP cell cultures with an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-inhibitory peptide prior to compression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> Active transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b2; is known to act upstream of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2) and aggrecan, both of which are involved in DDD development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> We have recently found that mechanical loads induce integrin &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>6</sub>-mediated activation of TGF&#x003b2;, which in return induces transcription of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2) to increase matrix proteoglycan production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> Knockout of TGF&#x003b2; type II receptor (T&#x003b2;RII) or integrin &#x003b1;v in the NP cells results in disc degeneration. Thus, integrin-mediated activation of TGF&#x003b2; in response to mechanical loads maintains disc function and homeostasis.</p><p id="Par6">The primary cilium is the immotile microtubule-based extensions as a single cellular protrusion presenting on nearly every mammalian cell. Primary cilium functions as a mechanosensor and dynamic signaling organelle that projects from the cell surface to sense microenvironment changes including diverse signal molecules and chemicals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> The specialized subcellular compartment of a cilium concentrates membrane-bound receptors to effectively detect mechanical stimuli, as well as sensory inputs and ligands from the extracellular environment for the cellular responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> Recent studies revealed that the vertebrate cell requires a single non-motile primary cilium to respond to Hedgehog (HH) family ligands.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> Interestingly, many G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are found to signal effectively in the cilia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> Cells with cilia defects cannot sense the changes in mechanical environment and are associated with numerous human diseases including spinal deformity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> NP cells stimulate anabolic synthesis of ECM proteins in the disc in response to mechanical stress. It is believed that cilia have a critical role in intervertebral disc function although there is no report regarding cilia on NP cells.</p><p id="Par7">Parathyroid hormone (PTH) secreted by the parathyroid gland binds to the type 1 PTH receptor (PTH1R), a GPCR and stimulates adenylate cyclase for formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> Increased cAMP levels activate protein kinase A (PKA) to induce phosphorylation of cAMP response element binding (CREB) protein, a transcription factor responsible for PTH downstream gene expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> PTH stimulates bone remodeling and orchestrates signaling of multiple growth factors and cytokines including TGF-&#x003b2;, Wnts, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), and Insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> PTH also spatially relocates small blood vessels closer to sites of new bone formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> The closer proximity of blood vessels allows more efficient delivery of nutrients for new bone formation. PTH emerges during the evolution of amphibians as they adapted to terrestrial life, indicating a potential role of PTH in spinal activity, particularly in intervertebral disc function. In this study, we sought to investigate how mechanotransduction in NP cells maintains the anabolic activity in the intervertebral disc. Our findings reveal that ciliary PTH signaling enables mechanotransduction for disc anabolic activity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>TGF-&#x003b2; activity decreased during disc degeneration of aging</title><p id="Par8">We systematically examined the changes of intervertebral disc during aging.

The current management modalities including total disc replacement and spinal lumbar fusion are unable to effectively slow or reverse the disease process. Spine provides the stable mechanical support for the body and protection of spinal cord with an array of joined vertebral bodies with cartilage at each end. Intervertebral discs, gel-like soft tissue, connect the vertebral bodies to provide flexibility for spine and absorb the mechanical loading transmitted along the spinal axis. In this study, we found that mechanical stress induces transport of PTH1R to primary cilia of NP cells to stimulate PTH-induced expression of &#x003b2;<sub>6</sub> integrin in activation of extracellular latent TGF-&#x003b2;. Importantly, mechanical loads in discs are necessary for transport of PTH1R to cilia in activation of PTH downstream signaling. iPTH treatment attenuates disc degeneration during aging, and disruption of primary cilia specifically in NP cells blunted the effect. Moreover, PTH1R was highly expressed in NP cells of aged rat and human discs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a&#x02013;d</xref>).

Discs depends on nutrients, oxygen, etc. from diffusion of sounding tissue with blood vessels, particularly endplates.

For bone tissue model, because of the large amount of trabecular microstructure, use of the geometry solid model may result in topological errors and undesired geometric features; hence, the need to preprocess with geometry repair and optimization operations. Subsequently, the finite-element mesh models can be directly discretized by 10-node quadratic tetrahedral elements from the geometry solid models, by an adaptive meshing tool in the VG Studio Max 3D software.

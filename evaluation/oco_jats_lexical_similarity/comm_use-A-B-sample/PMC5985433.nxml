All of these viruses are also transmitted in an urban cycle comprising humans and <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref></p><p>Urban epidemics of yellow fever were effectively controlled in the 1950s and 1960s by mosquito control and human vaccination programmes combined with strict enforcement of the International Health Regulations (IHR) requirement that travellers to and from endemic areas show evidence of yellow fever vaccination.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> The success of these programmes led to complacency and redirection of resources, which resulted in decreased compliance with vaccination requirements in endemic countries. This situation, combined with less strict enforcement of IHR for travellers, contributed to increasing epidemic transmission in some African and American countries.</p><p>Human cases of yellow fever in the past three years are at the highest level in decades, particularly in South America, where there were 3481 reported cases for the period July 2017 &#x02013; February 2018, more than double the total from the same period the year before. In 2016, 11 workers returning to China from Angola were diagnosed with yellow fever. Fortunately, no known secondary transmission occurred. This was the first time yellow fever had been reported from the Western Pacific and South-East Asian Regions, where approximately 2 billion people live in areas inhabited by <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> The people in these regions have had no previous exposure to yellow fever virus, are not covered by routine vaccination for the disease, and therefore have no immunity.</p><p>In this issue of the <italic>Bulletin</italic>, Shannon E Brent et al. estimated the number of air travellers to and from yellow fever virus-endemic countries.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Although these estimates are likely to be conservative,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> the data are alarming. With millions of unvaccinated travellers visiting yellow fever virus-endemic countries, it is only a matter of time before people infected with yellow fever virus travel to countries in South-East Asia and the Western Pacific and secondary transmission occurs. The number of unvaccinated travellers who become infected and export the virus between endemic countries is the highest in decades, with 10 cases already confirmed in 2018.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> If yellow fever is introduced to their countries, governments are likely to demand vaccine, but the global manufacturing capacity is inadequate. Although the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 50 million doses will be produced in 2018, this is not enough to provide emergency vaccination for a major epidemic. A yellow fever epidemic is likely to affect the global air transport system, causing delays and/or shortages in delivery of food and medicines, with potentially significant negative health and economic impact.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Passive laboratory-based surveillance, as currently practiced in most at-risk countries, is unlikely to detect the introduction of yellow fever virus in time to contain its spread. All governments in countries at risk of yellow fever introduction need to adjust their policies and funding priorities accordingly, to ensure adequate surveillance, vaccination and capacity for containment.</p><p>WHO&#x02019;s Eliminate yellow fever epidemics (EYE) strategy calls on countries to improve IHR adherence, strengthen surveillance by improving laboratory capacity and develop more effective urban mosquito control programmes.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> The strategy also suggests that endemic countries expand their national immunization programmes to include yellow fever vaccine. However, such expansion will not be feasible until the vaccine shortage is solved. Considering the current high risk of yellow fever spread, a global fund for yellow fever and other <italic>Aedes</italic>-transmitted diseases should be created to fund research, vaccination and capacity building programmes.</p></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><string-name><surname>Gubler</surname>

</p></sec><sec><title>Tobacco packaging breakthrough</title><p>Thailand has become the first country in Asia to adopt plain packaging for tobacco products. </p><p>Legislation requiring plain packaging for tobacco products will enter into force on 10 September 2019. </p><p>Under the new rules, cigarettes will be sold in drab brown coloured packs, free of any logos or images except for graphic health warnings, which are already obligatory in Thailand, as are textual warnings. Thailand also bans tobacco advertisement and promotion, restricts sponsorship and forbids the sale of tobacco products to people less than 20 years of age as well as the sale of single cigarettes. </p><p>Despite these control efforts the prevalence of tobacco use remains high in Thailand where, according to its 2017 national <italic>Smoking and drinking behaviour survey</italic>, roughly one in every five adults in the country smokes. The same survey reported that 37.7% of males aged 15 and above smoked, compared with 1.7% of females in the same age group. </p><p>Plain packaging of tobacco products is recommended under the Guidelines for the Implementation of Articles 11 and 13 of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC), a legal treaty that aims to protect present and future generations against the devastating health and socio-economic impacts of tobacco use. The introduction of plain packaging is expected to further boost the country&#x02019;s tobacco control efforts.</p><p>&#x0201c;Thailand&#x02019;s bold steps against tobacco &#x02013; the single most important cause of preventable deaths worldwide &#x02013; is commendable and reflects the country&#x02019;s earnest efforts in promoting health and well-being of its people,&#x0201d; said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director of the WHO South-East Asia, congratulating Thailand on its new tobacco legislation.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.searo.who.int/mediacentre/releases/2018/1704/en/">http://www.searo.who.int/mediacentre/releases/2018/1704/en/</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>WHO Director-General pushes for end of polio</title><p>WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus underlined WHO&#x02019;s commitment to the final push to eradicate polio on a 4-day visit to Afghanistan and Pakistan, the only two countries where wild poliovirus cases were reported last year.</p><p>Together with WHO Regional-Director for the Eastern Mediterranean Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari, Dr Tedros met with heads of state and senior government officials in both countries and witnessed first-hand WHO-supported health programmes.</p><p>Dr Tedros also visited the Emergency Operations Centre for Polio Eradication in Islamabad, Pakistan, where he commended the work of government and partners as &#x0201c;one team under one roof&#x0201d; and highlighted the critical importance of Pakistan working closely with Afghanistan to prevent cross-border transmission.</p><p>&#x0201c;We must all give our best on this last mile to eradicate polio once and for all. My wish for 2019 is for zero polio transmission. You have WHO&#x02019;s full support to help reach every child and stop this virus for good,&#x0201d; Dr Tedros said.</p><p>As recently as 30 years ago, wild poliovirus paralysed more than 350 000 children in more than 125 countries every year. In 2018 there were 29 reported cases in just two countries &#x02013; Afghanistan and Pakistan.</p><p>Polio eradication requires high immunization coverage everywhere to block transmission. Unfortunately, some children are still missing out on polio vaccination for several reasons, including lack of infrastructure, remote locations, population movement, conflict and insecurity and resistance to vaccination.</p><p>Failure to eradicate polio from these last remaining strongholds could result in a resurgence of the disease, with as many as 200 000 new cases predicted worldwide every year within 10 years.</p></sec><sec><title>India to tackle air pollution</title><p>India has launched an action plan to cut air pollution in the country&#x02019;s 102 worst affected cities. Announced on 10 January, the <italic>National clean air plan</italic> targets cuts in industrial and vehicular emissions as well as a reduction in the burning of biomass. The overall aim of the plan is to achieve a 20-30% reduction in particulate matter concentrations by 2024, relative to levels reported in 2017.</p><p>According to the WHO global ambient air quality database, 14 of the 15 cities with the worst air pollution in the world are in India. A study published in Lancet Planetary Health in December 2018, reported that toxic air claimed 1.24 million lives in India in 2017. </p><boxed-text id="Bb" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Cover photo</title></caption><p>Village women carry dried cow dung cakes in the Teliarganj area on the outskirts of the city of Allahabad, in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India.

Pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists are the main victims and those living in developing countries are worst affected.</p><p>&#x0201c;These deaths are an unacceptable price to pay for mobility,&#x0201d; said Dr Tedros at the launch of the report.</p><p>He noted that there are proven measures to reduce road traffic injury, including strategies to reduce speeding and address drinking and driving, among other dangerous behaviours. Also, safer infrastructure such as dedicated lanes for cyclists and motorcyclists can also help, as can improved vehicle standards such as those that mandate electronic stability control. Finally, prompt, effective post-crash care is vital to improving survival. </p></sec><sec><title>The Prince Mahidol Award Conference </title><p>This annual conference, held in Bangkok, Thailand, focuses this year on noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), under the banner: &#x0201c;The Political Economy of NCDs: A Whole-of-Society Approach&#x0201d;.

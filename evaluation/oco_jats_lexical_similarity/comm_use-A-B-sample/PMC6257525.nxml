artery and femoral vein cannulations for the safety of the operation and cardiac
decompression before sternotomy<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.
Also, minimally invasive surgery, robotic surgery, and adult extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation (ECMO) procedures<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>
usually require femoral vein cannulation as well. Moreover, femoral vein cannulation
may be preferred in emergency departments, catheterization laboratories, and even in
thoracic cases such as lung transplantation<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. However, when a femoral venous cannula is needed, venous
blood drainage difficulty is a key challenge for both perfusionists and cardiac
surgeons.</p><p>Hypovolemia, particularly in the venous system, creates a venous blood return
problem. Even in the presence of sufficient circulatory blood volume, blood may not
reach the pump if there is a venous collapse<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. It is known that the quality of venous drainage can be
affected by pre-load volume, after-load volume, and pump design<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>, as well as the venous cannula's
size and its design. Moreover, venous blood drainage can be affected by many
reasons, such as the venous cannula's position, small sizes of vessel lumens,
anatomic pathologies creating obstacles for vascular structures, massive air bloc in
the venous cannula or in the tubing line, kink of the cannula or the tubing line,
and obstruction of venous cannula's stages by vessels tissues or right atrial
tissues, which mostly results from excessive negative pressure inside the venous
tubing line<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. All the above-cited
reasons affect arterial blood flow and quality of perfusion. This situation
obligates cardiac surgeons to insert a second venous cannula through the internal
jugular vein or the axillary vein. However, some patients may, unfortunately,
present with contraindications to a second venous cannula insertion from the upper
site caused by a large goitre or severe neck arthrosis problems<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>. Therefore, a more effective
femoral venous cannula is required to decrease the problems mentioned above.</p><p>The aim of this study is to find out what features should be found on femoral venous
cannulas in order to provide a better drainage. In the literature, we couldn't find
any experimental study including artificial venous circulation design with renal,
mesenteric, and hepatic veins (HVs) lines. To perform the drainage tests under this
experimental venous circulation design, we utilised four mock femoral venous
cannulas (MFVCs), having different stages and different numbers of holes on the
polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tube, and we performed the experiment. After some
measurements and comparisons, we found that more holes on the venous cannula
resulted in better venous drainage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Mock Cannulas</title><p>There are various femoral venous cannulas available on the market today. All of
them have different diameters, lengths, stages, shapes, and numbers of holes. In
order to create equal conditions for the test, real cannulas were not used. To
realise this condition, four different MFVCs simulating femoral venous cannulas
were designed. These mock cannulas were made from PVC tube lines (RAUMEDIC-ECC)
with 1/4&#x0201d; inner diameter and 1/16&#x0201d; lumen thickness. The lengths of these mock
cannulas were kept the same at 68 cm. To compare the effectiveness of the number
of holes, a 5 mm aortic punch was used in order to get a standardised hole
diameter on the PVC tube. As indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure
1</xref>, four MFVCs were used to test and compare the performance of the
different number of holes on them. These MFVCs are: model A, simulates a
single-stage (SS) cannula; model B, simulates a two-stage (TS) cannula; model C,
simulates a multi-stage (MS) cannula; and model D, simulates a new designed mock
cannula as completely punched (CP). The SS model has no extra hole on the PVC
tubing line. The TS model has six holes on the PVC line: three on the proximal
tip and three 15 cm from the proximal tip of the model. The MS model has a 15 cm
punched area. There are 33 holes on the proximal side of the PVC line.</p><p><fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Four mock femoral venous cannulas designed from 1/4&#x0201d; polyvinyl
chloride (PVC) tubes: single-stage cannula (A), two-stage cannula

completely punched cannula (D).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-33-05-0435-g01"/></fig></p><p>The number of holes or drainage surface area is particularly significant for this
study. Therefore, the last MFVC model has a 50 cm punched area with holes on the
PVC line. Because of the large number of holes throughout this line, it is
called a CP model. The main difference of the CP model compared with other MFVC
models is that it has basically more holes on the PVC line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Mock Circulation</title><p>In order to compare four different MFVCs, a test circuit model was assembled, as
shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>. Various cardiopulmonary
bypass (CPB) equipments and assemblies were used, including two hard-shell
reservoirs, a roller pump, a digital touch screen monitor, pressure transducers
(Zyron disposable blood pressure transducer set, Point Medikal, Ankara, Turkey),
reusable transducer plates (Logical&#x000ae;, Medex), two pressure lines (150
cm), six 1/2&#x0201d;x1/2&#x0201d; luer lock (LL) connectors, four 3/8&#x0201d;x3/8&#x0201d; LL connectors, two
3/8&#x0201d;x1/2&#x0201d; connectors, a 3/8&#x0201d;x3/8&#x0201d;x3/8&#x0201d; Y-connector, a tubing clamp, a liquid
tank (LT), a plastic clamp band, and PVC tubes in different internal diameters
(ID), such as 1/8&#x0201d;, 1/4&#x0201d;, 3/8&#x0201d;, and 1/2&#x0201d;.</p><p><fig id="f2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Schematic test circuit design of the four mock femoral venous

they were filled with 2,500 mL of gelofusine solution by using 3/8&#x0201d; PVC lines
and a roller pump (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). Reservoir 1
(R1) volume represented superior vena cava and right atrial volume. Reservoir 2
(R2) volume represented inferior vena cava (IVC) and abdominal region venous
volume. The reservoirs' outlet connectors were connected by a 3/8&#x0201d; (ID) PVC line
(50 cm) and both 3/8&#x0201d; PVC lines were also connected to a 1/2&#x0201d; PVC tubing line
imitating the IVC. In order to imitate IVC well, four 1/8&#x0201d; PVC lines were also
connected to this 1/2&#x0201d; PVC line. These lines, from proximal to distal, simulated
HVs, right renal vein (RRV), left renal vein (LRV), and left common iliac vein
(LCIV), respectively. This designed circuit was ended with a 1/2&#x0201d;x3/8&#x0201d;
connector. This circuit mainly imitated the IVC's blood flow, but it also
imitated the blood volume and flow of the superior vena cava and right
atrium.</p></sec><sec><title>Application</title><p>To evaluate the MFVCs' hydrodynamic performance, the tests were performed in a
laboratory at 22<sup>o</sup>C room temperature, and gelofusine solution as a
colloidal fluid was used in order to mimic the blood. The test circuit was
completed with four MFVCs (SS, TS, 15 cm-MS, and CP), which were placed into the
1/2&#x0201d;x3/32&#x0201d; PVC line that was designed as the mock IVC. Initially, a SS mock
cannula was inserted into the mock IVC. To provide priming, both reservoirs were
filled with 2,500 mL of gelofusine solution withdrawn from LT by a roller pump.
In order to create free gravitational force, the whole circuit and pressure
lines were filled with gelofusine solution. Before test initiation, the roller
pump was stopped and a tubing clamp was put on the distal tip of the mock
cannula.</p><p>Pressure transducers were calibrated to &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; mmHg to ensure reliability. Whenever
the tubing clamp was removed from the distal tip of this line, the countdown
began at 60 seconds. The fluid in the reservoirs was drained into the measuring
cup (MC) via the effect of gravity syphonic drainage. At the end of 60 seconds,
the MFVC was clamped again.</p><p>Subsequently, the amount of this drained fluid was measured and recorded. After
each measurement, the reservoirs were refilled up to 2,500 mL level. These
measurements were repeated 34 times for each MFVC, and a total of 136
measurements were made during the entire experiment. During the drainage
process, different pressures were obtained in both distal and proximal parts of
the mock IVC. At the 5<sup>th</sup> second, both proximal and distal pressures
of the mock IVC were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Since the study used a within-subject design measuring four different dependent
variables (SS, TS, MS, CP) and as the dependent variables had a normal
distribution (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05) according to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test, then one-way repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) from
parametric tests were performed to determine statistical differences among the
groups. Also, from the <italic>post-hoc</italic> tests, Bonferroni tests were
executed to compare the drainage flow of the four different variables for the
experiment, which was repeated 34 times (n=34). A one-way repeated measures
ANOVA revealed a signi&#x0fb01;cant difference among the four different variables for
the drained fluid flow; F<sub>(3,99)</sub>=8725.22, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01.
Subsequently, a one-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed a signi&#x0fb01;cant difference
among the four different variables for distal pressure (Pd); F<sub>(3,99)</sub>=
9247.20, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01. Also, a one-way repeated measures ANOVA
revealed a signi&#x0fb01;cant difference among the four different variables for proximal
pressure (Pp); F<sub>(3,99)</sub>= 180.38, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The data obtained from the measurements of flow amounts and pressures provide
evidence to support the argument that, as the number of holes increases, the
pressure markedly decreases, particularly on the proximal side. Thus, the drained
volume of gelofusine increased significantly. According to the measurement results,
the flow volume of the TS venous cannula was higher than that of the SS venous
cannula. As expected, the volume performance of the MS venous cannula was better
than those of the SS and TS cannulas. However, better drainage performances were
obtained with the CP venous cannula. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figures 3</xref>
to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">6</xref> indicate pressures obtained from both
distal and proximal sides of SS, TS, MS, and CP MFVCs, respectively.</p><p><fig id="f3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Distal (Pd) and proximal pressures (Pp) of the single-stage (SS) mock

were obtained from CP MFVC. The mean pressures of the distal sides of SS, TS, MS,
and CP MFVCs were 22.029 mmHg, 20.882 mmHg, 19.029 mmHg, and 9.176 mmHg,
respectively. On the other hand, the highest Pp were obtained from SS MFVC, while
the lowest Pp were obtained from CP MFVC. The mean pressures of the proximal sides
of SS, TS, MS, and CP MFVCs were 20.852 mmHg, 20.588 mmHg, 20.059 mmHg, and 17.676
mmHg, respectively. The tests revealed that there was a statistically significant
difference among the mean pressures of the proximal side of each MFVC. The results
demonstrate that, as the number of holes on the MFVCs increases, both the Pp and Pd
of the cannulas decrease contrarily. Pressure differences of the MFVCs resulted in
different flow amounts provided by gravitation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure
7</xref> indicates the differences among flow amounts of these four MFVCs.
According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7</xref>, while the lowest flows
were obtained from SS MFVC, the highest flows were obtained from CP MFVC. The tests
revealed that there was a statistically significant difference among the mean flow
amounts of each MFVC. The mean flow amounts of the MFVCs reveal that, as the number
of holes increases, the flow volume increases linearly. In summary, both distal and
proximal mean pressures of the four variables decreased as the number of holes on
MFVCs increased.</p><p><fig id="f7" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Comparison among the flow amounts provided by gravitation of four mock
femoral venous cannulas in the end of 60 seconds.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-33-05-0435-g07"/></fig></p><p>One-way repeated measures ANOVAs indicate that the mean flow drainage is 2,483.23 mL,
2,561.17 mL, 2,603.23 mL, and 2,988.52 mL for the four dependent variables SS, TS,
MS, and CP MFVCs, respectively (<xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The
result of the Bonferroni test shows that, as the number of holes increases, the
amount of drained fluid by gravitation rises significantly. On the other hand, it
can be observed in <xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> that, as the
number of holes or the drainage surface area increased, the mean Pd of the MFVCs
significantly decreased from 22.02 mmHg (SS model) to 9.17 mmHg (CP model).
Similarly, as the number of holes increased, the mean Pp of the MFVCs significantly
decreased from 20.85 mmHg (SS model) to 17.67 mmHg (CP model).</p><table-wrap id="t1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Comparison among the flow amounts provided by gravitation.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="all"><colgroup span="1"><col width="16%" span="1"/><col width="16%" span="1"/><col width="16%" span="1"/><col width="16%" span="1"/><col width="16%" span="1"/><col width="16%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mock Cannulas</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean Pd (mmHg)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SD<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="TFN1">*</xref></th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean Pp (mmHg)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean Flow (mL)SD<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="TFN1">*</xref></th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SD<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="TFN1">*</xref></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SS (1 hole)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.02</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.38</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.85</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2483.23</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.76</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TS (6 holes)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.88</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.32</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.58</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2561.17</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.65</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MS (33 holes)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19.02</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.17</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.05</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2603.23</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.99</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CP (258 holes)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.17</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.45</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17.67</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2988.52</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17.77</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="TFN1"><label>*</label><p>SD=standard deviation.</p></fn><fn id="TFN2"><p>CP=completely punched; MS=multi-stage; Pd=distal pressure; Pp=proximal

having more holes on it. In our study, we found that the CP MFVC model performed
better for fluid drainage under the same test conditions than each mock cannula. Our
study revealed that a greater drainage area (number of holes on the tube) is the key
factor for a better fluid drainage amount.</p><p>In fact, the main reason behind the difficulties experienced with venous blood
drainage is the smaller size of the femoral vein. In such situation, the vein's
diameter is generally not suitable for insertion of a larger venous cannula for full
perfusion. To overcome this problem and to achieve full perfusion flow during a CPB
procedure, perfusionists generally must use a centrifugal pump on a venous line or
use negative pressure (-20 to -40 mmHg), which is called vacuum-assisted venous
drainage (VAVD). Unfortunately, these techniques create more complex connections and
may increase complications during CPB. When applying higher negative pressure into
the venous line<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>, gas microembolus will increase. Also, assisted
venous drainage may lead to air incoming to the venous bloodstream. Furthermore, the
higher negative pressure in the venous line will create higher shear stress and
haemolysis. To avoid such complications and to prevent vein collapse, additional
monitoring is also required<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. Under these conditions, the
design of femoral venous cannulas is highly important.</p><p>The four different mock cannulas shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure
7</xref> were tested regarding the relationship between the number of holes on
their tubing walls and the amount of fluid drainage. In fact, there were many
factors affecting fluid drainage and creating handicaps during these tests, such as
the position of the lines, position of the MFVCs that were inserted throughout the
inside of the mock IVC, level of the distal tip of the MFVCs, starting or stopping
fails on chronometry, fluid's viscosity, test room's temperature, etc. Obviously,
all these variables may affect liquid dynamics and measurements of the fluid amount.
Nonetheless, this test design simulating femoral venous cannula and human IVC
provided the facility to measure and compare four MFVCs, not only regarding their Pd
and Pp inside but also their provided amount of fluid.</p><p>In fact, the venous blood return towards to the right atrium is a result of the
pressure difference between the mean circulatory filling pressure and the pressure
in the right atrium. All these pressures and inner surfaces of the vessels create
intravascular resistance against the blood flow, and they contribute to the creation
of shear stress. In this experimental circuit, there was no such contrary pressure
making resistance to the gelofusine solution in the tip of the MFVC. This
peculiarity of the artificial circuit provided a very similar condition regarding
venous blood drainage to the venous reservoir during open heart surgery.</p><p>Many factors, such as the diameters and shapes of the cannulas, connections and
structures of the MFVCs, fluid's temperature, test room's viscosity, and velocity of
the fluid used in the test circuit, are influential on shear stress. We estimate
that all the above-cited factors affected the shear stress and the flow volumes
drained by gravitation in the tubes. Thus, they all contributed to create different
pressures in the distal and proximal sides of the MFVCs. These factors create shear
stress differences among the MFVCs, consequently causing flow differences.</p><p>The possible venous blood contribution for the VCI blood flow mainly comes from the
HV, RRV, LRV, LCIV and right common iliac vein. If a femoral venous cannula is
inserted into the right femoral vein towards the right atrium, the cannula itself
will form a barrier to the venous blood coming from iliac veins and renal veins. In
order to simulate this scenario, four 1/8&#x0201d; PVC lines were connected to the mock IVC
in the test circuit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). Through this
design, different drainage capabilities of four MFVCs were evaluated and compared.
In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the CP MFVC provided better fluid
drainage by free gravitation than the other MFVC models.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>In the clinical application, all the holes of the CP femoral venous cannula (FVC)
must be inserted completely into the venous system, therefore different sizes of
CP FVCs must be kept ready in the operating theatre and they must be selected
according to the length of the patient.</p><p>This study may be criticised regarding its simulation efficiency and its fidelity
of MFVC or mock IVC. In fact, our objective was not to achieve the perfect
fidelity of the circulatory and vascular systems. The aim of this study was
limited to created standard conditions for the MFVC tests. Yet, many more
variations, such as other fluids (hetastarch 6%, plasma, and even whole blood
with different hematocrit) in different rooms and fluid temperatures, precise
chronometry usage, the fidelity of vascular response and flexibility, <italic>in
vivo</italic> studies in animal laboratory, etc., may be considered
throughout the test circuit design in future studies about drainage performance
of CP MFVC.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>When we compared the results, they suggested that the CP MFVC model provided better
fluid drainage under the same test conditions than other MFVC models. While the CP
MFVC shows a reduced pressure for distal and proximal sides of the cannula, it
drained much more fluid. Our study may shed light on <italic>in vivo</italic>
studies, which need to be addressed in the future. This novel cannula design aims to
provide better and simply venous blood drainage from femoral vein.</p><table-wrap id="t3" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="50%" span="1"/><col width="50%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TS</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Conception and design of the work; acquisition of data;

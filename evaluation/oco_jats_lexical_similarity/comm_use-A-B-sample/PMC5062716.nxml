</p><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Aortoenteric fistulas represent a rare but life-threating condition, with an annual
incidence of 0.007 per million. In the scientific literature, there are about 350
cases of primary aortoenteric fistulas, fewer than 200 primary aortoduodenal
fistulas, and a total of 791 primary and secondary aortoduodenal fistulas<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. Autopsy reports suggest an
incidence of 0.02%-0.07% of primary fistulas and 1% in patients with abdominal aorta
reconstructions<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Due to
its close proximity with the abdominal aorta, the third and fourth duodenum
represent the most common involved digestive segments in aortoenteric fistulas,
followed by jejunum and ileum. The aortoenteric fistulas are classified into
primary, in which the digestive tract is compressed by an aortic aneurysm, and
secondary fistulas, produced by erosion of an aortic prosthesis into the digestive
tract. Mortality is very high, being 100% in untreated patients and 30-40% in
surgically approached fistulas<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.
The clinical picture of aortoenteric fistulas is characterized by a 'herald
gastrointestinal bleeding', with hematemesis and melena, followed by severe bleeding
and exsanguination. In clinical practice, there must be a high level of suspicion
combined with emergency computed tomography (CT) in order to allow a timely surgical
approach with or without a preoperative endovascular access. Despite current
imagistic advances, up to two thirds of the primary aortoenteric fistulas are
diagnosed on exploratory laparotomy.</p><p>The objective of this case report is to illustrate a rare cause of upper
gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be successfully managed. Written informed
consent for publishing the medical data and ethical approval of the hospital's
review board were obtained.</p></sec><sec><title>CASE REPORT</title><p>A 59 year-old patient was referred to our hospital for upper gastrointestinal
bleeding, revealed by hematemesis and melena. On clinical exam, the patient was
mildly hypotensive (110/60 mmHg), with significant paleness. Blood samples revealed
acute anemia (hemoglobin = 7.5 g/dl), and emergency upper gastrointestinal endoscopy
revealed a hiatal hernia and antral gastritis, with no visible source of bleeding.
Lower gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed no significant pathologies up to the final
10 cm of the ileum. An abdominal ultrasonography showed communication between the
abdominal aorta, below the origin of the renal arteries, and an anterior
pseudoaneurysm, with a diameter of 4.7/3.5 cm and orifice of 5.4 mm. Emergency CT
showed an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, 5.5 cm distal to the renal arteries
emergence, with thick walls and edema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure
1</xref>). Anterior to the aneurysmal aortic area, a 45/35 mm pseudoaneurysm in
close contact with a small bowel loop was observed, together with extravasation of
the arterial contrast material into the digestive tract. There was no free
retroperitoneal fluid.</p><p>

</p><p>The patient was transported to the operating room for emergency laparotomy. After
extensive Kocher and Catell-Brasch maneuvers, the aortic aneurysm was exposed in
close contact with the fourth duodenum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure
2</xref>). The upper pole of the aortic aneurysm was located 5 below the origin
of the renal arteries. After proximal and distal aortic vascular control, the fourth
duodenum was dissected from the aneurysmal area, and a 5 mm communication was
identified between the two anatomical structures. The duodenal defect was closed
with a continuous, double layer suture. The aortic aneurysmal tear was closed using
a Dacron patch, which was covered with biological glue and an omental pedicle. The
postoperative recovery was uneventful, with a restart of the oral diet in the fifth
postoperative day and discharge after 12 days.</p><p>

</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We presented the case of a successfully managed primary aortoduodenal fistula, based
on high resolution imaging and a multidisciplinary surgical team.</p><p>The primary aortoduodenal fistulas are clinically revealed by gastrointestinal
bleeding in approximately 80% of the cases, abdominal pain in 32% of the patients,
and a pulsating abdominal mass in 25% of the cases. The upper gastrointestinal
bleeding is usually self-limited, with a secondary massive hemorrhage within the
next six hours in one-third of the cases<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>One of the most suggestive CT signs for aortoenteric fistulas is ectopic gas outside
the intestinal lumen. It should be noted that ectopic gas may be found up to one
month after normal aortic graft repairs and perigraft fluid can be identified up to
three months later. Hagspiel et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> published the results of CT angiography in nine patients, one
with primary and eight with secondary aortoenteric fistulas. Primary CTs were
present in only 3 (33%) cases, showing active extravasation of the aortic contrast
into the bowel lumen in one (11%) case and migration of the aortic graft within the
bowel lumen in two (22%) cases. Secondary signs, which suggest aortoenteric fistulas
but may also be present in patients with graft infection, were: absence of
periaortic or perigraft fat planes (100%), thickening of the bowel wall located in
contact with the graft (89%), free fluid surrounding the graft (78%), and ectopic
gas (56%)<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Therapeutic approaches in patients with primary aortoenteric fistula may be either
open surgery or endovascular repair. Menezes et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> showed that there are no differences in overall
mortality when comparing endovascular with open aortic aneurysm repair (7.69%
<italic>versus</italic> 11.89%, <italic>P</italic>=0.263). However, patients
with a ruptured or inflammatory aortic aneurysm were excluded from this
cohort<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. In our case, we
decided for an emergency open approach instead of endovascular repair due to
significant contrast extravasation on CT and patient's decreased physiological
reserve in case of a failed endovascular approach. Burks et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> published their five-year
experience in endovascular repair of bleeding aortoenteric fistulas. Out of seven
patients managed with coil embolization (one) or endovascular stent graft (six),
three (43%) were alive at a mean of 36 months (range, 23-67 months) after the
procedure. There was one perioperative death due to fungal sepsis, persistent sepsis
that required laparotomy and bowel resection in one patient, and one patient with
recurrent sepsis managed by antibiotic therapy<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>. A Greek multicenter study compared open (17 patients) and
endovascular (8 patients) repair of secondary aortoenteric fistulas (mean of four
years after initial aortic surgery)<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. Although endovascular repair was associated with a lower early
morbidity and mortality, the long-term survival rates were similar after two years,
due to sepsis and/or recurrence of the fistula in the endovascular group<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The objectives of the open surgery are proximal and distal aortic control, management
of the intestinal defect and aortic repair. Reviewing the operative results of 81
primary aortoenteric fistulas, managed between 1818 and 1998, Lee et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> found a survival rate of 77.35% for
<italic>in situ</italic> grafting, 11.76% for extraanatomic bypass, 100% for
aneurysmorrhaphy, and 62.5% for rifampicin-soaked patch usage. We chose the patch
aortoplasty due to the simplicity of the method, with favorable short-term results
and low postoperative morbidity. The two-step approach was considered safer, with
high risk of infection for a definitive emergency aortic aneurysmal repair
concomitant with the duodenal closure. After postoperative recovery, the patient was
scheduled for elective aneurysmal repair in the cardiovascular service.</p><p>Lastly, Rodrigues dos Santos et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> analyzed the results of surgical repair in 791 cases of
aortoduodenal fistula. The results of the multivariate analysis revealed that
omentum interposition is the strongest independent predictor of survival. The most
common cause of death is fistula recurrence (41.8%), which is significantly higher
in patients with simple duodenorrhaphy<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Only an appropriate diagnostic workup based on a high level of suspicion can offer a
chance of survival in patients with aortoduodenal fistulas. Emergency referral to a
tertiary center with appropriate material and human resources may decrease the
morbidity and mortality of these patients.</p><p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="15%" span="1"/><col width="85%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1"><bold>Authors' roles &#x00026;

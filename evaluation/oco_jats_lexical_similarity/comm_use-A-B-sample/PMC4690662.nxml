which can take years of experience and training, working hard. The "new paradigm of
continuing education in surgery" says, "to provide appropriate educational
opportunities and gain knowledge, you must perform the trial
skills"<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>"The surgery simulation plays an increasingly important role in the educational
process and serves to bridge the gap in the current training model, which is the
operative exposure"<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. It also allows us to assess the cognitive components
and expertise of the operator in cardiothoracic surgery. Training in crisis
management and staff training have become more present in the care of critically ill
patients. The addition of adverse conditions in scenarios enhances the value of the
training exercise and provides a method to test responses to emergency situations.
The suggested support of interactive and intensive programs will increase the
ability of staff to effectively manage the perioperative events of cardiac surgery,
simulating specific and global crises in the operating room and intensive care unit
(ICU).</p><p>As in other surgical specialties, different procedures in cardiac surgery can be
divided into sub-areas of expertise. In this sense, different types of simulators
may be used, providing the opportunity to develop and evaluate a training program
for Resident Medical Doctors.</p><p>In particular, how to approach the coronary arteries and the knowledge of anastomoses
are fundamental techniques before entering the operating room. Using simulator
models, the resident has the opportunity to put into practice their theoretical
learning of the literature on coronary surgery requirements.</p><p>In response to the myriad of factors that currently influence the training of the
cardiovascular surgeon, there have been combined efforts to reform and transform the
medical training practices, allowing the resident to repeatedly perform the usual
surgical procedures, with the advantage of filling the most important gap in the
current training model: Exposure surgery<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Due to the aforementioned reasons, The European Association for Cardio-Thoracic
Surgery (EACTS), concerned with the cardiovascular surgeon training of their
institution, focused their efforts on changing the surgical training practices and
encouraged the opening of a competition for cardiac surgery trainees to build their
own simulator for coronary anastomosis, using everyday materials.</p><p>Six simulation prototypes were built by cardiovascular surgery trainees competing for
a prize. They were presented in the 25<sup>th</sup> European Association for
Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) Annual Meeting on October 1-5, 2011, in Lisbon,
Portugal. The overall evaluation of each prototype was performed according to preset
development criteria and all simulators provided a considerable contribution to the
simulation field in cardiovascular surgery.</p><p>The cardiovascular surgery team from Valladolid, Spain, was selected for the "Ethicon
Prize" for building a simulator for coronary anastomosis surgery, known as Arroyo
simulator<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>When designing simulation prototypes, trainees have demonstrated their ability to
think, which is very important for the development of the future of surgical
technique innovation.</p><p>In the following EACTS Congress in 2012 and 2013, prototypes for mitral valve repair
and aortic surgery were presented, respectively.</p><sec><title>Objective</title><p>To assess the technical performance of cardiovascular surgery residents, through
systematic training in coronary anastomosis using Arroyo simulator and three
different types of UNIFESP simulation models.</p><p>To provide adequate educational opportunities to gain the necessary knowledge in
the trial of surgical skills.</p><p>To maximize the training effect through continuous personalized feedback,
provided by the supervising surgeon.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>This project was scheduled by the Cardiovascular Surgery Division and developed in
the Alpha Center of Health Skills, Undergraduate Rectory, EPM - UNIFESP. The
training began in May 2013 and the data collection ended on February 28, 2014.</p><p>Ten residents of the Cardiovascular Surgery Division were invited to perform coronary
anastomosis on surgical training simulators. Participated in this survey:
1<sup>st</sup> year residents=3; 4<sup>th</sup> year=1; 5<sup>th</sup> year=3;
and 6<sup>th</sup> year=3. This work was also extended to 5<sup>th</sup> year
medical degree students participating in surgical training activities in the
Cardiovascular Surgery Division during their 40-weekperiod. Our Division, at that
time, did not have 2<sup>nd</sup> or 3<sup>rd</sup> year residents.</p><p>For teaching purposes, the participants were divided into three groups: Group 1:
1<sup>st</sup> year residents; Group 2: 4<sup>th</sup> or 5<sup>th</sup> year
residents; and Group 3: 6<sup>th</sup> year residents. The 5<sup>th</sup> year
medical degree students participated as observers and initiated practical
experience, with only 6 hours of practice, under the supervision of the
residents.</p><p>The training workload during the first 24 sections (6 months) was 2 hours weekly or 8
hours per month, using only the Arroyo simulator model, followed by 16 sections (2
months) with increased complexity of surgical procedures performing 4 hours weekly
or 16 hours per month, using four simulation models.</p><p>Supervision of surgical training with simulators was performed by a Cardiac Surgeon
in constant observation of activities, changing the systematic training for more
complex situations, and trying to assess logical reasoning and residents'
performance compared to different situations created at the time.</p><p>The Alpha Center for Health Skills - EPM - UNIFESP was used so that the residents'
training could take place in a non-sterile simulated operating room environment. The
workplace simulating an operating room had all the usual components. The surgery was
performed in Arroyo's simulators box type or dummy Unifesp model, which has an
opening in the chest cage, with access to mobile cardiopulmonary structures. The
training was videotaped, allowing for further analysis of the images in order to
assess the applicant's evolution as well as correct technique and systematic
surgical procedures performance.</p><p>Four simulation models were used to perform the coronary anastomosis technique:</p><list list-type="roman-upper"><list-item><p>- Arroyo simulator model;</p></list-item><list-item><p>- simulation model with dummy;</p></list-item><list-item><p>- simulation model with dummy and bovine heart;</p></list-item><list-item><p>- simulation model with dummy and pulsatile pig heart.</p></list-item></list><sec><title>I - Arroyo simulator model</title><p>The Arroyo simulator, developed by Heart Surgery trainees from Valladolid, Spain,
was featured in the 40<sup>th</sup> Congress of the Brazilian Society of
Cardiovascular Surgery, in Florian&#x000f3;polis in April 2013. Professor Paul
Sergeant (Belgium) was responsible for the presentation of the simulator to
guest surgeons and the orientation of the coronary anastomosis training. For the
simulator training, the Arroyo - Ethicon box, silicone tubing, wire
polypropylene (Prolene) 7-0, and Castroviejo needle holder were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Arroyo box Simulator - Instrumental used for coronary anastomosis

started in May 2013, remaining active until December 2013. It was composed of 24
training sessions with the Arroyo simulator. Initially, ten residents
participated in the activities, grouped in pairs with varying degrees of
experience (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><fig id="f2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Residents in training using Arroyo simulator.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-30-05-0562-g02"/></fig><p>Working inside the Arroyo simulator box allowed residents to simulate in-depth
anastomosis, using silicone tubes of approximately 5mm diameter. Three
modalities of anastomoses were performed: end-to-side, end-to-end, and
sequential, with polypropylene suture (Prolene) 7-0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><fig id="f3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Anastomoses confection with silicone tubes: a- end-toside anastomosis; b-

coronary arteries in different walls of the heart.</p><p>The supervision was performed by the same Cardiac Surgeon, guiding the coronary
anastomosis technique. The training time for each working section was 1 hour and
30 minutes to 2 hours.</p><p>For the evaluation of residents' performance, we used criteria already
standardized and classified in 10 items (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table

heart and externalized by the left atrium. Then, it was connected to the console
of an intra-aortic balloon pump (Datascope); and, finally, a softer simulating

sessions was 40 anastomoses each. The classification was based on two parameters:
reviewed score in each class and time that it took each group to reach 50 points or
90% of the maximum score.</p><p>Out of the ten cardiac surgery residents who were invited to attend the Training
Program, only two first year residents completed 36 sessions between May 2013 and
March 2014, performing 40 anastomoses each and using the four simulator models,
reaching 50 points.</p><p>The technical quality of the anastomoses improved with the evolution of the program
and through the combination of simulators. There was mastery of technique, skill in
handling the surgical instruments and anastomosis surgical performance. Throughout
the training, the time taken to perform the anastomosis was shortened by half and
the amount of issues in each anastomosis decreased significantly.</p><p>The anastomoses were performed with a single 7-0 polypropylene suture and tested with
aqueous or red dye solution; the number of additional stitches to contain the leak
decreased as experience increased. The types of anastomoses were end-to-side and
sequential.</p><p>The two 1<sup>st</sup> year residents underwent continuous (without interruption),
systematic (following the proposed methods) and sequential (attending to a schedule)
training, showing a progression in their score, bringing it up to 50 points, set as
the maximum score to be reached. The skills and ability in the surgical performance
also improved significantly with practice. The learning curve for operating time and
the number of events stabilized at about 30 anastomoses. As much as the residents
kept training, they had the opportunity to try all simulator models, until they
reached the highest score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f11">Figure 11</xref>).</p><fig id="f11" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig.11</label><caption><p>Evolution of First Year Resident Training in Cardiovascular Surgery, with

different difficulties created on purpose showed increasing improvement in the
confection of coronary anastomoses.</p><p>The use of the Arroyo simulator for 24 sessions facilitated the manipulation of the
subsequent three UNIFESP simulation models, increasing participants' expectations
for several reasons: 1. It is closer to real-life situation as it uses a porcine
beating heart; 2. The coronary arteries had diameters between 1.25 and 1.50 mm,
similar to human coronary arteries; and 3. There was the possibility of performing
the procedure with the heart beating and testing the use of a coronary stabilizer,
simulating myocardial revascularization without cardiopulmonary bypass (off-pump
coronary artery bypass grafting - OPCABG).</p><p>The use of a pig heart in the simulation of coronary anastomosis surgery allowed for
the expansion of this training to other simulation techniques, with an approach to
intracardiac structures with or without a heartbeat (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Chart 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Chart 1</label><caption><p>Programmed procedures with UNIFESP simulation models.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="none" style="background-color:#e6e7e8"><tbody><tr><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Coronary anastomosis</td></tr><tr><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Tricuspid valve repair</td></tr><tr><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Tricuspid valve replacement</td></tr><tr><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ebstein's anomaly operation</td></tr><tr><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Right ventricle remodelation surgery</td></tr><tr><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Blalock-Taussig shunt</td></tr><tr><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Bidirectional Glenn</td></tr><tr><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Aortic ring enlargement (Manouguian-Konno)</td></tr><tr><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ross operation</td></tr><tr><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Heart transplant</td></tr><tr><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total cavopulmonary anastomosis</td></tr><tr><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mitral valve repair</td></tr><tr><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mitral valve replacement</td></tr><tr><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14.</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Aortic valve replacement</td></tr><tr><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ASD Closure</td></tr><tr><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16.</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">VSD Closure</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="TFN01"><p>ASD=atrial septal defect; VSD=Ventricularseptal defect</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Cardiovascular surgery has greater difficulty in adopting new surgical techniques
compared to other medical and nonmedical areas. The first generation of cardiac
surgeons were brave pioneers, struggling with increasingly complex heart disease and
rewarded with the success of their techniques and procedures. Subsequent generations
transformed these observations into repeatable processes by establishing routines
while enjoying the use of imagination and creativity to develop new techniques or
modify already established ones, which contributed to the development of the current
cardiovascular surgery, benefiting patients of all ages.</p><p>Cardiac surgery has made considerable progress over the last 50 years. However,
effective processes that provide active learning and disseminate these advances are
missing.</p><p>The advances in medical and other instrumental techniques have revolutionized the
diagnosis and treatment of heart disease. At the same time, patients have become
aware of their own illness, through media and educational methods, and learned how
to look after their health.</p><p>The competence of the educational system database, now recognized as the most
popular, is achieved in the laboratory with the use of simulators. Similar to
simulators in the aircraft industry, this concept has become increasingly popular in
medical education worldwide.</p><p>Excellence Medical Centers have shown significant progress in teaching and learning
with simulators, which are increasingly sophisticated. Developing countries such as
India enhance training centers with low operating costs, using simple, inexpensive
simulators, but with great efficiency.</p><p>The technique requires good psychomotor skills development, through regular practice
and accompanied by expert suggestions. For each learning situation, different skill
components are defined.</p><p>The evolution of training methods in surgical technique has caused changes in the
traditional curriculum, in which the resident used to learn the surgical technique
in the operating room in a stressful atmosphere.</p><p>Practical methods to teach more complex surgical techniques were presented to
students in the 5<sup>th</sup> year of Medical School at EPM - UNIFESP, in
1991-1992, facilitating the understanding of surgical correction of heart defects in
discussion and awakening the interest of students. This material, prepared in the
Operative Technique Course at the Institution, allowed the scientific documentation
of techniques such as posterior enlargement of the aortic annulus (Manouguian
operation), anterior enlargement of the aortic annulus (Konno operation), remodeling
of the right ventricular outflow tract, among others.</p><p>The success of this educational model encouraged the professors of our Cardiovascular
Surgery Division to increase the demand for virtual medicine model, with simulators,
approaching the real-life situations in the operating environment.</p><p>On July 23, 1993, this new methodology for teaching and testing surgical techniques
in cardiac surgery was presented to the Brazilian Society of Cardiovascular Surgery
at the XI Unicor International Symposium, in S&#x000e3;o Paulo, where six surgical
procedures were performed by professors from Unifesp, surgeons and guests, in the
following order: Senning operation (Dr. Miguel Maluf), enlargement of the aortic
annulus (Dr. Luiz Carlos Bento de Souza), unsupported mitral valve implantation (Dr.
Bayard Gontijo), Atrial fibrillation (Dr. Marcelo Jatene), mitral valve repair (Dr.
Francisco Gregori), and cardiac transplantation (Dr. Jo&#x000e3;o Nelson Rodrigues
Branco)<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The successful outcome of this Cardiac Surgery Laboratory made it possible to
replicate this experience in other National Events, namely: the 3<sup>rd</sup>
Congress of the Society of Cardiovascular Surgery of S&#x000e3;o Paulo (SCICVESP) -
S&#x000e3;o Jos&#x000e9; do Rio Preto - 1993<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> and the 21<sup>st</sup> Congress of Cardiac
Surgery (BSCVS) - Porto Alegre - 1994<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. The results of this experiment program led to
Prof. Jos&#x000e9; Carlos de Andrade's<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> thesis defense. It was also cause for a
presentation at an International Congress, The Second World Congress of Pediatric
Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery, in Honolulu, Hawaii, 1997<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The Brazilian Society of Cardiovascular Surgery (BSCVS) adopted this training model
in their last six national congresses, under the name of Hands On, where new
specific simulators used for each module as well as ours had been developed by an
author for the same purpose as that of our study and used by 408
surgeons<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>At the time, the scientific documentation through recording tapes allowed the
organization of a file of surgical procedures available in our institution, with
free access to interested parties to review the technical details of the procedures
performed and teach at undergraduate and graduate levels.</p><p>After 24 training sessions with the Arroyo simulator, there was considerable progress
in manual skills and dexterity of surgical residents. Among the advantages of the
simulator, there were ease of transport and the possibility of individual training
in any working environment.</p><p>The increased complexity of surgical technique training, now with vascular structures
of smaller calibers (1.25 to 1.50 mm), and the ability to work in more real-like
tissues led us to train with two new simulator models: Bovine and porcine heart.</p><p>The adaptation to new models and simulators was facilitated by the continuous,
systematic and sequential training conducted with the Arroyo simulator.</p><p>Coronary artery bypass surgery without the aid of cardiopulmonary bypass with a
beating heart resurfaced with the introduction of minimally invasive techniques and
new stabilizers. For this reason, it was important to develop a method for forming
surgeons who perform accurate anastomoses, despite the rhythmic motion of the heart,
and to develop technical skills in order to get consistent results in this very
demanding field of cardiovascular surgery.</p><p>Encouraged by the experience of other authors<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> with the use of simulators keeping desktop pulsing to
mimic the "off pump" surgery, we built a pulsatile simulator at the Alpha Center for
Health Skills in order to train coronary anastomosis surgery as well as other intra-
and extra-cardiac techniques that compromise the right side of the heart structures
while keeping a rhythmic heartbeat.</p><p>The training in this type of mobile simulator did not present great difficulties for
the 1<sup>st</sup> year residents in training, who are used to practicing with the
Arroyo simulator and two previous UNIFESP models.</p><p>The progression of skills in training residents at this time evolved into simulation
techniques to correct heart defects on the right side of the heart using the
pulsatile model and on the left side of the heart with a stationary heart.</p><p>With these simulation models, we can demonstrate the feasibility of setting up a
program based on the simulation of complex surgical procedures in a systematic way.
The complexity of each level was determined by the objectives of a predefined
training checklist and evaluation. In addition, it was developed and validated as
specific content of assessment tools for each simulation scenario.</p><p>"In the future, the health system will likely follow the example of civil aviation,
military and nuclear power plants, making training based on rigorous simulation and
evaluation as part of routine education and medical practice"<sup>[<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The Leuven Training Center (Belgium) has effectively employed a multimodal simulation
approach, incorporating virtual learning since 2000. This center has trained 950
surgeons and anesthesiologists from 61 countries<sup>[<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Finally, training activities, and specifically the Surgical Division, should be
valued and rewarded. Surgeons' training is supposed to encourage academic promotion
and leadership positions. Few academic institutions use this criterion, even though
their main mission is the education of future professionals.</p><p>It is time to invest in our profession, emphasizing the science of learning and
establishing the extensive use of safe and effective learning tools in combination
with systematic supervision, essential for the future of Cardiovascular Surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The residents' training in Cardiovascular Surgery (CVS) must not be occasional, but a
continuous, systematic and sequential process to achieve the desired results.</p><p>The four prototype simulators used for CVS Residents' training have been developed at
low cost and have increasingly higher fidelity in simulating real-life
situations.</p><p>Residents in training have shown interest, commitment and engagement in scheduled
activities, with increasing improvement in skills, creativity and logical thinking,
which are very important for the development of surgical techniques and innovative
procedures.</p><p>This training was incorporated into the Medical Residency Program of Cardiovascular
Surgery at EPM - UNIFESP and may be useful in the preparation of candidates to
become Specialists.</p><p>We believe that all institutions that have a medical residency program should have
mandatory training of their residents, considering the need for an initial
investment and low maintenance cost.</p><table-wrap id="t4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-top-style:solid"><th colspan="4" align="left" rowspan="1">

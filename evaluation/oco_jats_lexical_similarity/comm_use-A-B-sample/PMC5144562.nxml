importance of repair for mitral valve. Besides, we have attended a lot of meetings
describing several repair techniques for different pathologies. Both European and
American guidelines offer mitral valve repair whenever it is possible and they even do
not suggest surgery under some circumstances if the likelihood of successful repair is
not more than 95%. Papers from Europe and United States declare up to 70% repair rate
for mitral valve and the trend is increasing each year<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Is it the case for us? As junior cardiac surgeons, we feel sorry for each valve we
replace in our centre. That's why we checked our databases to answer the question, "what
are we doing to the mitral valve?" The result was far beyond the results of developed
countries. We repaired 28% of mitral valves in 2014. This was almost 50% more than the
year 2012 as we repaired only 20% of mitral valves but still too low. Low for whom?
Developed countries...</p><p>In a speech during the 28<sup>th</sup> European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery
Annual Meeting, Maldonado reported the rate of mitral repair in Latin America, and the
results were almost the same as ours. Surgeons in Colombia, Chile, Mexico and Brazil
repaired 30%, 32%, 39% and 42% of mitral valves, respectively, during 2013. What does
this mean? Developing surgeons! Don't they know how to repair mitral valves in
developing countries? It shouldn't be the case as each of the above countries has
worldwide known and experienced surgeons, for example, the Brazilian Cardiac Surgery
Society has more than 1200 surgeons performing around 70 thousand cardiac operations
every year.</p><p>Etiology of mitral valve disease is the most probable answer for the difference between
developing and developed countries. Degenerative mitral valve regurgitation is the most
suitable target for repair. Euro Heart Survey revealed that 72% of mitral valve diseases
were pure mitral regurgitation and the majority (61%) of etiology was degenerative
disease of the valve<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. On the other
hand, the Turkish registry of heart valve disease showed that only 30% of pure mitral
regurgitation was due to degenerative valve disease and the majority has either ischemic
or rheumatic origin. Only 15% of the mitral valves were repaired during the
registry<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>As the majority of the valves referring to surgery are not suitable for repair, surgeons
in developing countries, such as Turkey, will be replacing them for a long time. As it
is the case, chordal preservation should be considered<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. Repairable
valve pool is so shallow that a relatively inexperienced surgeon may ignore it during
his daily practice and replace a suitable valve. That shouldn't be the case as repair is
superior to replacement in many ways. That's why all patients with mitral valve disease
should be evaluated by an experienced clinician (echocardiographer) for the possibility
of repair. Valve repair requires a unique collection of techniques. A valve with an
isolated annular dilatation isolated posterior leaflet prolapse (chordal rupture) or
isolated posterior leaflet restriction may be repaired by a relatively inexperienced
surgeon but an experienced surgeon is needed for isolated anterior leaflet prolapse,
bi-leaflet prolapse or diffuse prolapse of posterior leaflet. More complex lesions of
mitral valve like, commissural prolapses, Barlow disease with diffuse involvement,
rheumatic disease or calcified leaflet/annulus, should be operated by a reference
surgeon in a Heart Valve Centre of Excellence<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Physical conditions of a Heart Valve Centre of Excellence may be mimicked in a developing
country but here comes another question, "who is a reference surgeon?''. Lack of open
access database for surgical results makes this question unanswerable in the developing
world.</p><p>As a conclusion, we believe in mitral valve repair. We don't have as much suitable valve
as developed countries so we are going to replace mitral valve for a long time. When a
surgeon faces with a diseased mitral valve he/she should give a chance to repair. But
one should be aware that ''not all that he/she can do is, what he/she has to do'',
he/she must know what he can do but also he/she must know what he can't do. We should
know our limitations and don't be afraid of asking for some help. The patient safety
must always come first.</p></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Iung</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Baron</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Butchart</surname><given-names>EG</given-names></name><name><surname>Delahaye</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Gohlke-B&#x000e4;rwolf</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Levang</surname><given-names>OW</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>A prospective survey of patients with valvular heart disease in

of human beings and preserving its anatomical and physiopathological characteristics
are needed for research on the development of endovascular devices<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. Materials used in the
correction of aortic endovascular aneurysms are under constant improvement in search
of the ideal device for a minimally invasive treatment<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Experimental models in animals have been used in vascular and endovascular surgery
for decades. The literature is rich in studies proposing models of aortic aneurysms
with the used of a myriad of techniques<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. However, the fast pace of advancements in science
demands frequent evaluations of established methods in search of improvements and
adaptations according to the changing needs of clinical research.</p><p>The objective of our study is to propose modifications to an experimental model of
aortic aneurysm in swine with bovine pericardial patch (Perini,
2008)<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>,
aiming at better reproducibility, to be used in the study and development of
endovascular prostheses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>This was an experimental study conducted at the Center of Experimental Surgery and
Bioterium (CCEB) of the University of Health Sciences of Alagoas (UNCISAL) in
Macei&#x000f3;, AL, Brazil.</p><p>The project was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of UNCISAL. The ethical

by the same farmer, properly vaccinated and dewormed, according to their age. The
animals were kept in individual stalls with water <italic>ad libitum</italic> and
fed with feed, without the addition of lipid supplements, balanced and adapted to
their age.</p><p>The experiment consisted of two phases. In the first phase, the saccular aneurysm was
created using a bovine pericardial patch. In the second phase, 15 days after the
first one, patency was confirmed through Doppler ultrasonography, using LOGIQe
(GE<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>). In both phases, anesthesia was administered in
compliance with the protocol for general anesthesia in swine of the
CCEB/UNCISAL.</p><sec><title>Technical anesthesia</title><p>The animals were placed under a 12-hour solid food fast and a 3-hour liquid fast
and were weighted before pre-anesthetic induction. Anesthesia was administered
according to the CCEB/UNCISAL protocol, using subcutaneous atropine, ketamine,
and intramuscular midazolam as pre-anesthetic drugs. Next, venoclysis was
performed in the marginal ear vein with Jelco 20 catheter for the infusion of
liquids and drugs. Fluid replacement was achieved with 0.9% saline solution at
20 ml/kg/hour. Inhalation anesthesia was maintained with halothane and oxygen
using a facial mask.</p></sec><sec><title>Surgical procedure</title><p>In the first phase, the abdominal aorta was exposed using the transabdominal
approach, with a median xiphopubic incision, followed by circumferential
dissection of the aorta between the renal arteries and the distal branch (common
iliac arteries and internal iliac artery branch).</p><p>A 3 cm segment was chosen to make the aneurysm, the branches were repaired with
3.0 linen thread, and intravenous heparin (100UI/kg) was administered. Then, the
proximal and distal aorta was clamped to the chosen segment and longitudinal
arteriotomy was performed, followed by suturing of the previously made 3x3 cm
bovine pericardial patch in the shape of a sac using 6.0 polypropylene
continuous suture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2</xref>). Layered closure of the cavity was
performed: retroperitoneum with 3.0 catgut running suture; peritoneum with 2.0
catgut running suture; aponeurosis with 0 mononylon U-suture; skin with 3.0
mononylon Donati suture.</p><p>

aneurysm has brought the need for experimental models to improve related materials
and techniques, being the <italic>in vivo</italic> experimentation with animals the
most adequate for the execution of these studies<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The models adopted should correspond as much as possible to the physiology and
physiopathology of humans. Since the similarities in the anatomy and fibrinolytic
and coagulation systems of humans and swine are established in the literature -
which is less observed for other species such as rabbits, dogs, rats, and mice, the
pig was chosen for this study<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Among the advantages of using swine in cardiovascular research, the following can be
highlighted: easy handling; characteristics of the lipid metabolism, lipoprotein
profile, and platelet aggregation; formation of thrombus and deposits of fibrin
after endothelial lesion; and histological similarity to human neointima. The
disadvantages are the rapid weight gain, the cost of maintenance, lower tolerance to
anesthesia, and the risk of medullary ischemia with paralysis of the hind
paws<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Several studies have described models of aortic aneurysm in experimental
animals<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>. Among others, of importance are methods such as
the use of anterior synthetic patches [polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or
Dacron], fascia, peritoneum, intestine, and internal jugular vein;
adventitial resection; interposition of the patch; the use of elastase; and
transluminal dilation. All of them have advantages and disadvantages, therefore, the
researcher must be aware of the characteristics of each technique <sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In this study, we opted for creating an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm from a
bovine pericardial patch according to the model proposed by Perini<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>, but with a few
modifications.</p><p>Bovine pericardium has been used in vascular surgery since 1971, when Ionesco and
colleagues used a cardiac valve prosthesis made with bovine pericardium preserved in
glutaraldehyde. The purpose of the glutaraldehyde solution is to reduce antigenicity
and increase resistance to degradation. Aneurysmal dilation of the pericardial patch
may occur, but there are no reports of rupture with other synthetic patches
<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In 2008, Perini<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>
reported a new abdominal aortic aneurysm model in swine, with a bovine pericardium
sac. To that end, 11 Large White female swine, with an average weight of 20 kg, were
used. The study was divided into two phases, with a 15-day interval between the
creation of the aneurysm and the analysis of its variables (thrombosis, rupture,
surgical morbidity and mortality). Our study followed the same procedure, with an
equal number of animals, the same gender and weight characteristics, and respecting
the 15-day interval between the creation of the aneurysm and the analysis of the
variables. However, a few alterations were made in order to simplify the method and
further reduce its cost.</p><p>In terms of animals, hybrid swine were used, crossbred Large White and Landrace,
rather than the usual purebred Landrace or Large White. For the anesthesia,
halothane was used for inhalation instead of isoflurane, which lowered the costs.
Despite reports in the literature of the incidence of malignant hyperthermia with
the use of halothane in Landrace and Large White swine <sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>, this was not observed in
the hybrid animals used in this study.</p><p>The transperitoneal approach was used to access the aorta rather than the
retroperitoneal. Since the swine gain weight rapidly, making them difficult to
handle when they are bigger, swine with an average weight of 20 kg were used. In
these animals, dissection and exposure of the aorta through the retroperitoneal
approach is more technically difficult to achieve due to the limited surgical field
and small caliber of the vessels. There were no cases of evisceration nor
complications related to handling intestinal loops, as described in the literature
(cardiac arrhythmia, distension or difficulty to close the abdominal wall).</p><p>Patency of the aorta and the aneurysm sac 15 days after it was created was verified
with Doppler ultrasonography. This method made it possible to analyze not only the
presence of flow inside the aneurysm sac, but also the hemodynamic characteristics
of the flow, providing a greater amount of information. In addition, the cost is
lower and there is no exposure to radiation, compared to an angiographic study.</p><p>Experimental models of aortic aneurysm to be used in the training of endovascular
techniques should have as many characteristics as possible in common with those
found in humans. Among them, it is essential to have an increase in diameter of 50%
compared to the diameter of a normal aorta, patency of lumbar arteries, and
stability of the aneurysm allowing for surgical manipulation in a few weeks or
months <sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>. So far, no other model had associated the
aforementioned characteristics with other advantages, such as the lower cost, low
morbidity and mortality, and easy reproducibility.</p><p>The saccular aneurysm model with bovine pericardium proved to be adequate to test
endovascular devices, since it mimics a similar situation to that found in aneurysms
observed in humans, with proper diameter, patency of the collateral and terminal
branches of the lumbar plexus, and partial thrombosis of the wall. Bovine
pericardium is commercially available as a patch for arterial repair, in a range of
cuts and sizes and cheaper than Dacron and PTFE. The short interval between the
creation and maturation of the aneurysm (15 days) allows the model to be used in
larger animals without increasing maintenance costs with medication and feed.
Surgical time needed to perform this technique was well tolerated by the swine,
without the complications described in the literature, such as paralysis of the hind
paws, death from anesthetic complications, renal failure, intestinal perforation,
sepsis, early rupture, and thrombosis of the aorta or iliac arteries.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Based on this study, we have shown that the technique proposed for the confection of
abdominal aortic aneurysm using bovine pericardium has good patency rates and it
could be used to prepare experimental models for the development of new endovascular
prostheses. The modifications made to the original technique have helped to
reproduce the model at a reduced cost, without prejudice to the analysis of the
proposed variables.</p><table-wrap id="t3" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="10%" span="1"/><col width="90%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1">

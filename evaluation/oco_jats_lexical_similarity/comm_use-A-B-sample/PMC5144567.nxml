It has been reported that the incidence of carotid artery disease in patients
scheduled for coronary revascularization is 2.8%-22% and the incidence of coronary
artery disease in patients scheduled for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is
28-40%<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Simultaneous CEA and coronary artery bypass
grafting (CABG) was first described by Bernhard et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>, in 1972. Since then, the most efficacious and
safest surgical procedure, minimizing mortality and neurological complications, has
been sought, but there is still no clear consensus on the ideal approach.</p><p>The aim of this study is to compare safety and efficacy of different surgical
techniques for combined CABG and CEA, with the main outcome measures being the
in-hospital neurologic complications and mortality.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>This retrospective study involves 136 patients who had concomitant CABG and CEA in
our institution, between January 2002 and December 2012. The institutional review
board of the hospital approved the study. Preoperative, intraoperative and
postoperative data of patients were reviewed from patient records.</p><p>Mean age of patients was 65.9 years. There were 29 (21.3%) females and 107 (78.7%)
males. Most of the patients (94.1%) had multivessel coronary involvement and only 8
(5.9%) patients had single vessel disease. Previous myocardial infarction (MI) was
observed in 54 (39.7%) patients and 106 (77.9%) patients had unstable angina
pectoris (USAP). Carotid duplex scanning was routinely performed in patients
scheduled for coronary revascularization. Symptomatic patients with stenosis of more
than 70% were considered for combined operation. Asymptomatic patients were further
evaluated with conventional or tomographic angiography before decision making for
combined surgery. Thirty two (23.5%) patients had history of stroke and 19 (13.9%)
had history of transient ischemic attack (TIA), and 85 (62.5%) patients were
asymptomatic. Bilateral involvement of carotid arteries was reported in 94 (69.1%)
patients. Patients with permanent neurological deficit and patients having
concomitant procedures besides revascularization were excluded. Demographic

harvesting under general anesthesia. Carotid arteries were explored in standard
manner, then clamped and opened, followed by endarterectomy using a carotid
shunt in most of the cases. Arteriotomy was closed directly or by using
saphenous patch, then it was deaired and clamps were released. Leaving the
incision open to avoid hematoma formation, cardiac part of the operation was
iniated with a standard median sternotomy. After this, left internal mammarian
artery was harvested, cardiopulmonary bypass was established with standard
aortic arterial-unicaval venous cannulation and systemic heparinization. Body
temperature was lowered to 30-32&#x000ba;C. Antegrade or combined antegrade-retrograde
blood cardioplegia was used for cardiac arrest and myocardial protection. After
distal anastomosis was completed, cross-clamp was removed and proximal
anastomosis was constructed with a partial occlusion clamp while the patient was
being rewarmed. With discontinuation of cardiopulmonary bypass, heparin was
reversed and both incisions were closed in routine fashion.</p><p>In the second group of patients, CEA was applied as described, followed by
coronary revascularization with off-pump technique using mechanical stabilizers.
Proximal anastomoses were performed with a partial occlusion clamp in an area of
ascending aorta deemed free of atherosclerotic disease.</p><p>In third group of patients, surgery started with the cardiac procedure.
Cardiopulmonary bypass was established in routine manner, and after this, distal
anastamosis were constructed. Continuous retrograde blood cardioplegia was used
and patients were cooled to a mean systemic temperature of 25&#x000ba;C (22&#x000ba;C-27&#x000ba;C) for
cerebral protection. Afterwards cardiac procedure finalization, CEA was
performed in the same manner, except without using a shunt while the aorta
remained clamped. The remaining part of cardiac procedure was completed while
the patient was being warmed to normal systemic temperature of 37&#x000ba;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for Social
Science (SPSS) version 15.0 for Windows. Data were analysed using descriptive
statistical methods (mean, standard deviation, frequency) and qualitative data
were compared using Chi-square test for categorical variables. Quantitative data
were analysed using Student t test for comparing intergroup differences of
continous parameters. Kruskal Wallis and Mann Whitney U tests were used for
comparing quantitative parameters not normally distributed between groups.</p><p>Statistical significance was assessed with <italic>P</italic> value less than

revascularization<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.
Carotid artery disease has been shown to be an important etiological factor in
postoperative stroke<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. Naylor et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>, in their review
article, reported the incidence of stroke following a total of 190449 CABG to be
1.5-2.0%, but in case of co-existing severe carotid artery disease, the risk
increases to 6.7%. Once happens, mortality of post-CABG stroke was reported to be
23.1%. Nwakanma et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> stated
that adding CEA to CABG did not increase short and long term morbidity and
mortality, and combined procedure can be done safely in this high risk group of
patients.</p><p>Optimal surgical treatment for patients having concomitant severe coronary artery and
carotid artery stenosis remains uncertain. There are different surgical techniques
that may be chosen depending on the patient characteristics, severity and morphology
of lesions in vascular beds, the experience and preference of the center and the
surgeon. Surgical options include staged approaches in which CEA or CABG are
performed following one another with a certain time interval in between and
synchronous approach in which CEA and CABG are performed under same anesthesiology
session. Although several studies report higher mortality and stroke rates with
combined surgery compared to staged surgery<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>, most of the
papers report comparable and better outcomes with synchronous procedures<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>. Outcomes of different studies documenting the results of
synchronous surgery vary widely, with a stroke rate between 1% to 4% and mortality
rate between 1% to 5.4%<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>-<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>. This variation might be due to patient profiles included
in the studies (symptomatic <italic>versus</italic> asymptomatic). In our study
stroke rate was 5.1% which is higher than would be expected, but 37.4% of our
patients were symptomatic and 69.1% had bilateral involvement of carotid
arteries.</p><p>Postoperative stroke is believed to be multifactorial; besides carotid artery
disease, atherosclerosis of ascending aorta is an important source of emboli in
on-pump CABG. Inadequate cerebral perfusion pressure, systemic vasodilatory
response, risk of atheroembolization due to cannulation and aortic clamping,
increase the risk of operative stroke during CPB<sup>[<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>-<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup>. In
order to avoid these factors, some centers preferred off-pump coronary
revascularization with CEA. Meharwal et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> reported results of their 82 patients who had combined CEA
and off-pump CABG without stroke and mortality, stating off-pump CABG avoids
cardiopulmonary bypass as one of the contributing factors for stroke. Two years
later the same group reported that this procedure is safe and effective, with
shorter intubation time, intensive care unit stay and hospital stay even in a group
of patients with high risk for perioperative stroke due to aortic arch
atherosclerosis, advanced age, severe ventricular dysfunction besides carotid artery
disease<sup>[<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup>. The study by
Gopaldas et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>, also
supported off-pump CABG to be associated with lower stroke risk than on-pump CABG in
synchronous surgery group. In our clinic, off-pump CABG has been in practice since
1993, and is mainly preferred for single or double vessel revascularization. A
previous study by Eren et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup>
from our center reported no stroke and 3.7% mortality for patients who had CEA and
simultaneous off-pump CABG. In the literature, reported rate of mortality is between
0-4.5% and rate of stroke is between 0-3.1% for combined CEA and off-pump
CABG<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>-<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup>. In
this group of patients, our mortality and stroke rates were 6.9% for both. One of
the mortalities was secondary to stroke in a high risk patient with bilateral
carotid lesions and recent MI who was probably operated by off-pump technique due to
this profile. We did not observe any further benefit with off-pump technique
compared to on-pump technique, except for shorter intensive care unit and
hospitalization times.</p><p>Systemic hypothermia reduces the metabolic tissue rate and is generally employed for
neuroprotection during cardiac and aortic surgeries. Khaitan et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> reported simultaneous CEA and
CABG during single cross-clamp, under 25&#x000b0;C of hypothermia for further cerebral
protection, as a safe technique with a mortality rate of 5.8% and stroke incidence
of 5.8%. Guibaud et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> also
stated hypothermia below 28&#x000b0;C provides better cerebral protection especially for
patients with bilateral carotid lesions. Eren et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> reported the results of the first 15 patients of
our center being operated under 25&#x000b0;C of hypothermia without stroke and
mortality.</p><p>Although statistically it was not found to be an important difference among groups,
there was no postoperative stroke in group III. There was a statistically
significant relation between postoperative stroke and body temperature; systemic
temperatures &#x0003e; 28&#x000b0;C, increase stroke risk 6.7 times (OR: 6.712; 95% CI:
0.831-54.192). In contrast to this benefit, hypothermia was found to increase risk
of myocardial infarction 3.5 times (OR: 3.490; 95% CI: 0.785-15.515). This might be
due to increased ACC and CPB times which were increased significantly compared to
group I and it might have contributed to cardiac event related to mortality seen in
this group of patients.</p><p>The main limitation of this study is its retrospective nature rather than being a
prospective randomized clinical study. Patients were not divided into different
surgical treatment groups depending on pre-determined criteria and the decision of
using off-pump technique or moderate hypothermia was surgeon dependent. Although
preoperative characteristics were not significantly different among groups in terms
of cardiac and neurological status, this might have created bias.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In this study, we aimed to compare different management techniques of synchronous
surgery for coronary and carotid disease, in order to obtain a consensus regarding
the best approach. Low rate of neurological events with hypothermia was
de-emphasized by its detrimental cardiac effects. We found no advantage of one
technique over the other; therefore it was impossible to conclude that a single
principle might be adapted into standard practice. Patient specific risk factors and
morphology of the atherosclerotic disease might be more important determinants of
postoperative morbidity and mortality rather than the surgical technique.</p><table-wrap id="t5" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="10%" span="1"/><col width="90%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors&#x02019; roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">AAD</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Analysis and/or data interpretation; conception and

unspecified and severe trauma, characterized by elevated morbidity and
mortality. The complex inflammatory MOFS-related reactions generate
important ischemia-reperfusion responses in the induction of this syndrome.
Nitric oxide elevation, through the activation of cyclic guanosine
monophosphate (cGMP), has the potential of counteracting the typical
systemic vasoconstriction, and platelet-induced hypercoagulation. Tadalafil
would possibly act protectively by reducing cGMP degradation with consequent
diffuse vasodilatation, besides reduction of platelet-induced
hypercoagulation, thus, preventing multiple organ failure syndrome
development.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The experimental protocol was previously approved by an institution animal
research committee. Experimental MOFS was induced through the stereotaxic
micro-neurosurgical bilateral anterior hypothalamic lesions model. Groups of

disseminated multiple-organs lesions, provoked primarily by diffusely spread
micro-thrombi. The treatment with tadalafil 2 hours after the
micro-neurosurgical lesions reduced the experimental MOFS lesions
development, in a highly significant level (P&#x0003c;0.01) of 58.75%. The
treatment with tadalafil, 4 hours after the micro-neurosurgically-induced
MOFS lesions, also reduced in 49.71%, in a highly significant level
(P&#x0003c;0.01). Finally, the treatment with tadalafil 8 hours after the
neurosurgical procedure resulted in a statistically significant reduction of
30.50% (P&#x0003c;0.05) of the experimentally-induced MOFS gravity scores.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor, tadalafil, in the doses and timing

societies, especially in the last hundred years<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. In United States, trauma is the leading cause of morbidity
and mortality for persons, from birth to 44 years of age. In the last decade, more
than 13 million adults with 20-49 years of age were injured, and nearly 80,000 were
killed, with US$ 406 billion in lost productivity and medical bills every
year<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. In this scenario,
the prevalence of multiple organ failure syndrome (MOFS) has been very high,
affecting one-third of all in-hospital patients, being responsible for more than 50%
of all intensive care unit (ICU) patients' deaths<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. This previously unknown post-trauma sequential
dysfunction syndrome, despite being suspected by medical teams, since the ICU
emergence, in 1958, was only officially recognized when the global term "multiple
organ failure" (MOF) first appeared in Index Medicus, in 1983<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. However, its existence could be
found in very remote descriptions, like the one, in 1823, of William
Cumin<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>, surgeon of the
Royal Infirmary and the Asylum of Lunatics, of Glasgow, and by Joseph Swan,
physician of the Lincoln County Hospital, in the same number of the Edinburgh
Medical and Surgical Journal. They reported the pathological lesions in several
organs not primarily damaged of six burned patients that died days after trauma.</p><p>Cumin<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> observed, with high
accuracy: "...distant internal parts sympathized with the burned surface and suffer
inflammation...". Other XIX century authors, such as Cooper<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>, in 1839; Long<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>, in 1840; or Curling<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>, in 1842, among others, had
described similar findings, with no repercussion in the scientific community.</p><p>Recent authors had described similar pathological findings secondarily associated
with trauma, in soldiers wounded in military actions during the World War II, as
Moon<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>, in 1947, and
Mallory et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>, in 1950. These
papers described the occurrence of a picture of global and diffuse organic
deterioration, typical of MOF, an unknown pathology at that time. They reported the
presence of diffuse endothelial lesions, in several organs, with capillary and
venules engorgement. The development of disseminated micro-thrombosis was a most
common finding. In 85% of the cases, the examined lungs showed edema and congestion.
Atelectasis could be found in 70%, and fat emboli in 65% of the cases.
Intra-alveolar hemorrhages were found in 51% of all cases. The cardiac
histopathology showed fat vacuolization in 24 of 44 (54.5%) examined cases. The
liver examination presented fat vacuolization in 53 of 60 (88.3%) examined cases in
patients that died up to 96 hours after trauma. In these cases, were detected the
presence of centrilobular pyknosis and nuclear disintegration. In these studies,
kidneys microscopy showed presence of fat vacuolization, especially of the ascending
limb of loop of Henle, in 55% of cases, reaching 85% when death occurred between the
first and fourth post-trauma day. Tubular epithelial necrosis, basal membrane
lesion, presence of hyaline, granular or hematic cylinders, diffuse endothelial
lesions, vascular engorgement and diffuse micro-thrombosis were some of the most
frequent secondary post-traumatic findings reported by these authors.
Moon<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> and
Mallory's<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> descriptions
reported a clinical picture of global, diffuse organic deterioration, in association
to typical MOFS histopathological findings. Coincidentally, these histopathological
findings were the same as reported afterwards, in cases of MOFS.</p><p>Maire and Patton<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>, in 1956,
reported the development of multiple organic lesions in rats submitted to pre-optic
nuclei stereotaxic electrolytic experimental lesions. This paper was the basis for
Oliveira et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> experimental
methods, to conjecture on the hypothesis of the occurrence of a trauma-induced
multiple-system derangement pathophysiologic process, that they called secondary
post-traumatic syndrome, possibly based on a central nervous system (CNS)<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> imbalance. These authors proposed, based on the Wiener's
Theory of Systems logic, that non-specified trauma would result in an adaptation
Selye's alarm reaction (AR) CNS-induced syndrome<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>. For this reason, in this experimentation, it
will be utilized a similar micro-neurosurgical experimental model of MOFS
induction.</p><p>MOFS can be defined as a complex, subacute, pathological manifestation, necessarily
developed after a gap of apparent clinical stability, to a generalized picture of
multiple organic deterioration, characterized by confluent anatomic lesions,
typically associated to ischemia/reperfusion lesions, finally translated into
diffuse micro-thrombosis and tissue hemorrhages<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. MOFS may occur in any severe trauma, such as burns,
pulmonary aspiration, multiple transfusions, acute pancreatitis, extracorporeal
circulation, sepsis, among many other causes<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>. It is important to reinforce that sepsis is only
one of the possible causes of activation of several humoral, inflammatory,
coagulation, immunological factors, inducing an average of 35% of all MOFS cases.
The remaining 65% of cases are probably based on AR CNS-induced
pathophysiology<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>.</p><sec><title>Possible Beneficial Actions of Nitric Oxide in MOFS Development</title><p>In 1987, Ignarro et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>
detected that the endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), described in 1980
by Furchgott and Zawadzki<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>,
was, indeed, a very simple molecule: nitric oxide, that proved, however, to have
several important physiologic actions. Such actions, mediated by cyclic
guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), can be listed as:</p><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>a) regulation of vascular tone, influencing tissue blood flow and
arterial pressure;</p></list-item><list-item><p>b) platelet function, by controlling its adhesion and
aggregation;</p></list-item><list-item><p>c) neurotransmission at the level of some motor neurons of the
parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system that
modulates intestinal peristalsis and penile erection;</p></list-item><list-item><p>d) also acts at nitric oxide-sensitive neurons of the respiratory
centers of medulla oblongata;</p></list-item><list-item><p>e) nitric oxide (NO) stimulates NMDA receptors at hippocampal area,
improving mechanisms of long-term memory;</p></list-item><list-item><p>f) activation of immunity/inflammatory systems, aiding to kill
various pathogens, such as virus and bacteria;</p></list-item><list-item><p>g) inhibition of inflammation and exocytosis of various mediators,
from endothelial cells, macrophages and cytotoxic T lymphocytes;</p></list-item><list-item><p>h) increase of renal blood flow, with improvement of rate of

gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH);</p></list-item><list-item><p>j) adrenaline from adrenals or other exocrine secretions, such as
amylase from the pancreas<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup>.</p></list-item></list></p><p>NO is a labile lipid soluble gas synthesized in several areas of the organic
system. Is synthesized from the amino acid l-arginine by the NO synthase (NOS).
During this synthesis, NO is transformed into a monomer that, in the presence of
tetrahydrobiopterin, turns into a dimer. Therefore, in the presence of
calmodulin and molecular oxygen, it converts l-arginine to NO, and citrulline,
as a by-product<sup>[<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Ischiropoulos et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>, in
1994, and Preiser et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>,
in 1995, were the first to suggest the therapeutic utilization of inhaled NO in
prophylaxis and treatment of adult respiratory distress syndrome, the most
important component of MOFS pathologic constellation. In addition, it was
reported that inhaled NO-induced improvement in the pulmonary hypertension
associated with experimental septic shock in pigs, with concomitant elevation in
the cardiac ejection fraction.</p><p>It is important to emphasize that inhaled NO has very short half-lives varying
between 6 and 40 seconds<sup>[<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup>. However, when released into the intrapulmonary spaces
and pulmonary vessels, NO is inactivated very quickly by combination with
hemoglobin, yielding methemoglobin as an end-product. Therefore, the important
vasodilator effect of inhaled NO is rapidly neutralized, and remains restricted
to the lung vascular and airways systems, with reduced or no systemic effects.
In addition, it is very important to emphasize that most of NO systemic effects
are due to the activation of cGMP that, on the other hand, is neutralized by 11
different phosphodiesterases. Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) has the most desirable
characteristics to be inhibited if secondary vascular and coagulation profile
are to be preserved for a longer period. Therefore, if systemic actions are
intended, as the needed in MOFS, it must be used a PDE5 inhibitor, that will
maintain the NO-induced cGMP activation functioning for a long period, in the
entire organic system<sup>[<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Therefore, it became obvious that, instead of utilizing inhaled NO, a short
half-life gas<sup>[<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup>, the most effective way to universally elevate tissues
levels of NO would be through the utilization of PDE5 inhibitors, such as
tadalafil, sildenafil, vardenafil, udenafil or avanafil<sup>[<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup>. Tadalafil would be the best PDE5 inhibitor candidate
to inhibit NO degradation and, hence, enhancing the system NO circulating
levels, for a prolonged period. NO, indeed, has several beneficial actions,
especially the systemic vasodilatation, and reduction of platelet aggregation,
that would possibly reduce the development of micro-thrombosis - the MOFS basic
inducing factor<sup>[<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup>. Therefore, it was decided to
ascertain the potential protective effects of tadalafil, in the MOFS
development, utilizing an experimental neurosurgical model in this syndrome
induction<sup>[<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The choice of tadalafil was pharmacologically based on its easy and fast
absorption, favorable pharmacokinetic profile, such as low first-pass
degradation, large volume of distribution, and relatively slow metabolism and
excretion<sup>[<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup>. In addition, and specially
for its long half-life and benign therapeutic profile, it was finally chosen as
the drug that, for its characteristics of inducing long-term NO tissue
concentrations, would result in of vasodilation and reduction of the coagulation
profile<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup>. This would act reducing the
potential of development of micro-thrombosis, the pathologic basis for MOFS
development. For this reason, the authors proposed to experimentally verify its
efficacy in reducing MOFS development, especially by prolonging its
multiple-system half-life through the utilization of a PDE5 inhibitor:
tadalafil.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Animals, Environment and General Procedures</title><p>The <italic>in-vivo</italic> experiments protocol was approved after a review

electrolytic procedure, under ethyl ether anesthesia, by sectioning the
abdominal vessels. In our laboratory experience, this period was enough to allow
the development of intermediate-to-severe gravity MOFS pattern. In addition,
intermediate-to-severe levels of multiorgan involvement would make possible the
evaluation of, either attenuation or potentiation of MOFS evolution. Aorta
washing was not performed in order to preserve the already formed
microthrombosis in several organs. The following organs were removed, fixed in
neutral 10% formaldehyde solution and after embedded in paraffin and stained
with hematoxylin-eosin for further histological examination: brain, lungs,
heart, spleen, liver, kidneys (and adrenals), and stomach-duodenum. Spleen,
duodenum, heart and adrenals histology were not studied in this work due to its
minimal MOFS-related deterioration. Animals with inappropriately placed cerebral
lesions were discarded and replaced in the experimental series. MOFS evolution
will be presented as follows: the histopathological assessment was quantitated
by reviewing ten microscopic field of every slide, the following an arbitrary
grading scale, basing on literature and to our previous experience. The gravity
scores varied from 0 to IV.</p><p>The histopathology examination was performed by a "blind" physician
(pathologist). The microscopic slides were identified only by a
computer-generated randomized numbers. The identifications of the slides
utilized a code, that was broken after finished slide examination. The scores
were attributed to every slide, basing on the sum of each grade of ten 64X
microscopic neighbor fields. Therefore, the minimum field damage score (absence
of lesion) would be 0 (zero) and the maximum field damage score would be 4
(four). Since were examined 10 fields per slide, that multiplied by each field
damage scores, would reach 40 per each organ, reaching 00 or 40. This value,
multiplied by 5 organs, would reach a maximal value of 200, and then multiplied
by 10 slides per group, we would have a final minimal score of 0000, and a
maximum score of 2000. A 250X magnification was utilized, in cases of doubt,
only in order to detect specific qualitative tissue damage for grading
classification.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The results (mean&#x000b1;SD) evaluates organ damage through the consolidated

</p></list-item></list></p><p>As mentioned before, the three most important PDE5 inhibitors currently available,
tadalafil, sildenafil and vardenafil, have a number of functional differences.
Especially concerning their selectivity and specificity of inhibition, the PDE5
inhibitors have their effects associated, not only to their safety profile, but also
in the biopharmaceutical and pharmacokinetic characteristics. Those differences may,
significantly, affect the efficacy profile of these drugs<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Tadalafil protective actions are, possibly, supported by its cGMP-induced
vasodilation, platelet aggregation inhibition and inflammatory modulation
effects<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>. Tadalafil presents absorption of about 36% of
the oral dose through the gastrointestinal tract, which is, in general, similar to
sildenafil and vardenafil. However, CYP3A is the major hepatic metabolizing enzyme
for the 3 PDE5 inhibitor agents, having a lower effect on tadalafil, characteristic
responsible for its longer half-life<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The major route of elimination of all PDE5 inhibitors is hepatic metabolism through
CYP3A. Tadalafil, however, has low hepatic extraction. Renal elimination of the
nonmetabolized drug represents less than 1% of the elimination pathways. The
elimination half-life is 3-5 hours for sildenafil and vardenafil, as compared to
17.5 hours of tadalafil<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>For its greater therapeutic window, tadalafil requires less time for effectiveness,
which was one of the most important reasons for its choice as the central drug for
testing PDE5 inhibitors as potential protectors against MOF development.</p><p>The results presented in this work, shows, definitely, that tadalafil acts
protectively against experimentally-induced MOFS development, especially when the
drug is administered before the neurosurgical induction procedure. In our
experiments, the group of tadalafil treatment done 2 hours after operation resulted
in a highly significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) reduction of 58.75% of MOFS
organ damage gravity. In the group of tadalafil treatment done 4 hours after
operation, it was also detected a highly significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01)
reduction of 49.71% of MOFS organ damage gravity. Finally, in the group of tadalafil
treatment done 8 hours after operation, it was detected a still significant
(<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) reduction of 30.50% of MOFS organ damage gravity.
The increasing fall in tadalafil protective profile, sequentially detected, among
the three post-surgery groups, would probably due to the spontaneously developing
MOFS reactions that continues to occur in the not-protected periods of 2, 4 and 8
hours. However, the drug continues to show its protective characteristics, even
eight hours after the neurosurgical MOFS induction. Therefore, it suggests that the
protective tadalafil effect continue to occur even after a relatively long period
after trauma (8 hours), a situation that usually occurs in clinical conditions, such
as in clinical emergency-treated cases.</p><p>MOFS mortality, regardless whether induced by sepsis or by other etiologies, in the
ICUs<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> has been between 23% and 76%, whereas, the overall
mortality of MOFS patients in hospital environment is between 32% and 89%.
Therefore, our experimental work suggests that further clinical trials should be
designed to verify tadalafil efficacy in MOFS prophylaxis and treatment in ICU
clinical environment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The results presented in this work, shows, that tadalafil acts protectively against

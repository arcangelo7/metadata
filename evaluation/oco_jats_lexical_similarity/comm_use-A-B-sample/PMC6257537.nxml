ascending aortic and right atrial or bicaval cannulation has been the standard
approach to the majority of cardiac surgical procedures. However, minimally invasive
techniques involving surgical exploration and cannulation without median sternotomy
have been described in recent years<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. In minimally
invasive procedures, CPB requires cannulation of the right internal jugular vein and
right femoral artery and vein. However, complications associated with peripheral
cannulation are sometimes observed<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. We have been
performing peripheral cannulation methods such as the U-suture technique in our unit
since 2012. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the clinical results and vascular
flow patterns after peripheral cannulation for robotic cardiac surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>A total of 216 consecutive robotic valvular and atrial septal defect (ASD) operations
were performed between January 2013 and April 2017. The mean follow-up time was 25.7
months (range 2-44 months). Patients who were not eligible for robotic surgery and
therefore could not undergo minimally invasive surgery were excluded. This group
included patients with severe coronary artery disease, obesity (body mass index
[BMI] &#x0003e; 30), aortic valve insufficiency, lung adhesions, chest wall deformities,
or iliofemoral artery disease. All patients underwent detailed preoperative
examination, including computerized tomography, as well as transesophageal
echocardiography (TEE) to assess surgical risk. Excluding patients who died or were
lost to follow-up, a total of 192 patients attended outpatient follow-up, and
femoral arterial and venous flow pattern was evaluated with Doppler ultrasound (DUS)
in 145 patients. The patients' demographic data and risk factors are shown in <xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Most of the procedures performed were

intubation. Superior vena cava cannulation was performed via percutaneous access
to the right internal jugular vein with 17-F arterial cannula (DLP, Inc., Grand
Rapids, MI, USA) following an injection of 100 IU/kg of heparin. External
defibrillation pads were placed, and patients were positioned supine with right
chest elevated by 30 degrees. A soft tissue retractor (Alexis Retractor, Applied
Medical, CA, USA) was used to expose the surgical area without rib intervention.
The right femoral artery and vein were surgically accessed through a groin
incision and another 300 IU/kg of heparin was administered before cannulation.
Two 5-0 polypropylene purse-string sutures were placed in the femoral vein and a
24-29-F venous cannula (DLP Inc., Grand Rapids, MI, USA) was inserted through
the purse-string sutures. Under TEE guidance, the tip of the venous cannula was
placed at the junction of the inferior vena cava and right atrium over a
flexible J-wire. Arterial cannulation was performed using the U-suture
technique. The common femoral artery was explored, and 5-0 propylene or 3-0
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) pledgeted sutures were placed on the left and
right sides of the femoral artery, leaving an area of approximately 2-5 mm in
length and width between the sutures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figures
1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">B</xref>). The 18-20-F arterial
cannula (DLP Inc., Grand Rapids, MI, USA) was inserted into the common femoral
artery between the two U-sutures using the Seldinger technique. TEE guidance was
routinely used to follow the guidewire during cannulation in order to avoid
cannula malposition and vascular traumas such as dissection and rupture.
Furthermore, TEE was also used to evaluate valve dynamics and detect evacuation
of air (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). Upon completion of the
cannulation procedure, CPB was initiated and lung ventilation was stopped. The
ascending aorta was occluded using a Chitwood transthoracic aortic cross-clamp
(Aesculap Inc., Corporate Parkway Center Valley, PA, USA). The Chitwood clamp
was placed through the third intercostal space along the right anterior axillary
line, then cold antegrade crystalloid Bretschneider's cardioplegia was
administered to the aortic root to arrest the heart.</p><p><fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>A) Placement of double pledgeted polytetrafluoroethylene sutures in

using a Siemens SONOLINE Anteres ultrasound system (Germany) with a 7-3 MHz
probe. Peak velocity increases in areas of stenosis in proportion to the degree
of narrowing. It was observed that, at the proximal site of the cannulation
segment, significant increase at the peak systolic velocity corresponded to
lesions of 50% or more narrowing in the luminal diameter of the artery. At the
distal segment of the cannulation site, the peak systolic velocity was measured
as equal or lower than the proximal stenotic segment measurements. Color Doppler
imaging was used to detect turbulent flow. The venous caliber and the presence
of turbulent flow were evaluated in venous examination.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS </title><p>A total of 216 patients underwent robotic-assisted cardiac surgery during the study
period. Of these patients, 4 (1.85%) died in the hospital and 20 (9.26%) were lost
to follow-up, leaving 192 patients under outpatient follow-up. The mean follow-up
was 25.7 months (range 2-44 months) and the mean postoperative hospital stay was 6
days (range 5-9 days). There was no late mortality. Postoperatively, cannulation
site infection occurred in 3 (1.56%) patients and seroma in 9 (4.69%), all of whom
were successfully treated with outpatient care (<xref rid="t3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="t3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Surgical parameters and postoperative mortality and peripheral vascular

rate was calculated as 70-178 cm/s (mean 124.12 cm/s) and common femoral vein
diameter was 5.9-12.8 mm (mean 8.2 mm). Flow pattern in the common femoral arteries
was triphasic in all patients except for 2 (1.38%). In these 2 patients, DUS of the
common femoral artery revealed 60% narrowing of the lumen, monophasic flow pattern,
and subnormal flow rates (32 cm/s and 35 cm/s). These patients remain under
outpatient follow-up for arterial stenosis with no complications or complaints to
date. Chronic recanalized thrombosis in the common femoral vein was detected in 2
(1.38%). DUS showed luminal narrowing and thickening of the common femoral vein
wall. No venous turbulent flow was detected.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we retrospectively evaluated complications related to peripheral
cannulation in patients who underwent robotic cardiac surgery. Our aim was to
determine whether the technique we used led to any differences in postoperative
complications compared to other peripheral cannulation techniques in robotic cardiac
surgery.</p><p>Robotic mitral valve surgery is among the most commonly performed robotic cardiac
procedures in the last decade. The benefits include smaller, less invasive
incisions, less incisional pain, shorter hospital stay, better cosmesis, quicker
return to usual life activities, and reduced blood loss and need for
transfusion<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. However,
femoral artery and vein cannulation is required for CBP and may result in vascular
injury. In our practice, we use femoral artery and vein cannulation for CPB and
Chitwood clamping of the ascending aorta, as described by Chitwood et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>, to avoid complications and reduce
the cost of the surgery. In general, operative times and results were similar to
those of conventional surgical techniques<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>It has been reported that prolonged peripheral artery cannulation in patients
undergoing minimally invasive operations can cause limb ischemia and potentially
lead to ischemic complications<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>. In our series, the CPB and
ischemic times did not exceed the expected limits. We observed no ischemic
complications in the cannulated extremities that required thrombectomy and/or
fasciotomy in the early postoperative period.</p><p>Muhs et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> investigated
arterial injuries related to femoral artery cannulation in 739 consecutive patients
who underwent minimally invasive cardiac surgery. They reported postoperative
claudication in 4 patients, 3 of whom had iliofemoral arterial occlusion or
localized iliofemoral dissection and were treated with an iliofemoral bypass;
another patient had localized femoral artery stenosis which was treated by
angioplasty. In our series of 192 patients, none complained of claudication. We
believe this is attributable to the U-suture technique, which does not require
femoral arteriotomy or clamping.</p><p>All of our patients were followed in the outpatient clinic due to problems related to
femoral artery and venous cannulation, and patients with possible flow abnormalities
were evaluated by DUS. Although stenosis was detected in the common femoral artery
in two of our patients, they have shown no symptoms and have not required treatment.
The two patients with chronic recanalized thrombosis in the common femoral vein are
also asymptomatic. Overall, vascular complications were minor and infrequent in our
series.</p><p>In routine practice, the femoral transverse arteriotomy technique is commonly used in
various departments<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. Our technique provides optimal
arterial lumen diameter and reduces the risk of arterial thrombosis and femoral
hematoma. However, comparison of these two techniques was not possible in the
present study, since we only utilize the method described above in our department.
Nevertheless, this study demonstrates that the U-suture technique has low
complication rates when applied in the context of robotic cardiac surgery.</p><sec><title>Limitation </title><p>A limitation of this study is that different cannulation techniques cannot be
directly compared in our center. Furthermore, the mean follow-up time was not
very long. Because this is a relatively new cardiac center, the single-center
and retrospective design of this study is a limitation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, femoral artery cannulation for robotic heart surgery with U-suture
technique can be successfully performed with good mid-term peripheral vascular
outcomes.</p><table-wrap id="t5" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="50%" span="1"/><col width="50%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">OS</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Conception and study design; analysis and/or data

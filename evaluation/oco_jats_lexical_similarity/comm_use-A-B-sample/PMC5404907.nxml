In young mice, intermittent administration of parathyroid hormone (iPTH) at 20&#x02013;80&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg/day interacts synergistically with artificially applied loading to increase bone mass. Here we report investigations on the effect of different doses and duration of iPTH treatment on mice whose osteogenic response to artificial loading is impaired by age. One group of aged, 19-month-old female C57BL/6 mice was given 0, 25, 50 or 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg/day iPTH for 4&#x000a0;weeks. Histological and &#x003bc;CT analysis of their tibiae revealed potent iPTH dose-related increases in periosteally-enclosed area, cortical area and porosity with decreased cortical thickness. There was practically no effect on trabecular bone. Another group was given a submaximal dose of 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg/day iPTH or vehicle for 2 or 6&#x000a0;weeks with loading of their right tibia three times per week for the final 2&#x000a0;weeks. In the trabecular bone of these mice the loading-related increase in BV/TV was abrogated by iPTH primarily by reduction of the increase in trabecular number. In their cortical bone, iPTH treatment time-dependently increased cortical porosity. Loading partially reduced this effect. The osteogenic effects of iPTH and loading on periosteally-enclosed area and cortical area were additive but not synergistic. Thus in aged, unlike young mice, iPTH and loading appear to have separate effects. iPTH alone causes a marked increase in cortical porosity which loading reduces. Both iPTH and loading have positive effects on cortical periosteal bone formation but these are additive rather than synergistic.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="ab0010"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="li0005"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>iPTH causes dramatic intra-cortical porosity in the aged mouse tibia.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>In trabecular bone, iPTH reduced some of the beneficial effects of mechanical loading.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Mechanical loading reverses some of the deleterious effects of iPTH in cortical bone.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>The effects of iPTH and mechanical loading were additive.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="ks0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Ageing</kwd><kwd>Osteoporosis</kwd><kwd>Bone</kwd><kwd>Parathyroid hormone</kwd><kwd>Mechanical loading</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Throughout life, bones adapt their architecture to ensure that they are sufficiently robust to withstand the habitual levels of mechanical loading to which they are subjected without accumulation of excessive microdamage, or sustaining fracture. This functional adaptation, achieved by the processes of modelling and remodelling in response to the local strain environment engendered by loading, is commonly referred to as the &#x0201c;mechanostat&#x0201d; <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. With increasing age there is failure to maintain the balance between formation and resorption with resulting progressive net bone loss <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Previous studies by ourselves and others have documented that bone's adaptive responsive to anabolic stimulation by mechanical loading is impaired in aged mice <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. It is probable that this reduced ability to respond appropriately to mechanical stimulation is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of age-related bone loss <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>Pharmacotherapy targeted at enhancing aged bones response to mechanical loading should therefore have the potential to prevent some of the deleterious effects of ageing on bone and restore functionally-relevant structure. Intermittent administration of parathyroid hormone (iPTH) was, until recently, the only licensed anabolic treatment for osteoporosis <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>The mechanism of action of PTH has been extensively studied in mice and other experimental models. PTH acts predominantly through its receptor, PTH1R. Previous studies have investigated both tamoxifen-inducible targeted deletion of PTH1R and constitutively active PTH receptor (caPTH1R) in osteocytes using a Dmp1-Cre. Deletion of PTH1R in osteocytes results in loss of both cortical and trabecular bone <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> although a further study documented conflicting results with a high bone mass phenotype <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Conversely, mice expressing caPTH1R in osteocytes had dramatically increased bone mass, but only when they also expressed the Wnt co-receptor LRP5 <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Furthermore, the caPTHR1 transgenic mice demonstrated greatly reduced Sost expression, the gene encoding sclerostin protein which negatively regulates Wnt signalling via LRP co-receptors. An additional study using Sost overexpressing and knockout mice indicated that reduction of sclerostin appears to contribute to some extent to the anabolic effect of PTH <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Sclerostin down regulation is also a necessary step in bone's anabolic response to mechanical stimulation <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> suggesting some commonality between the mechanisms of action of iPTH and mechanical stimulation.</p><p>A previous study from our laboratory demonstrated that combining iPTH and mechanical loading caused a far greater anabolic response than would have been expected from the response to either treatment alone in both cortical and trabecular bone compartments of the mouse tibia <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Therefore, we hypothesized that iPTH would have the potential to &#x0201c;sensitize&#x0201d; aged bone to the anabolic effects of mechanical loading and &#x0201c;rescue&#x0201d; its impaired adaptive response. However, to our knowledge, this interaction has only been studied in young female mice that have not yet displayed any age-related bone changes.</p><p>Although the effects of iPTH have been extensively studied, to our knowledge there are no studies showing the effect of different doses or duration of iPTH treatment in aged mice. Because different studies have used different doses and duration of treatment, it is difficult to compare the results presented by different groups. Thus, in this study, we aimed to determine the effect of different doses and duration of treatment with iPTH alone and the effect of iPTH on the response of aged bone to mechanical loading.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Animals</title><p>Nineteen-month-old female C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Charles River Inc.

The right tibiae were subjected to external mechanical loading under isoflurane-induced anesthesia three times per week for two weeks starting from day 3 or 29 for the 2-week- and 6-week studies respectively.

The flexed knee and ankle joints are positioned in concave cups; the upper cup containing the knee, is attached to an actuator arm of the loading device and the lower cup to a dynamic load cell. The tibia is held in place by a 0.5&#x000a0;N continuous static pre-load. 40&#x000a0;cycles of dynamic load are superimposed with 10s rest intervals between each cycle. The protocol for one cycle consists of loading to the target strain (measured on the medial aspect of the tibia at the 37% site from the proximal end), hold for 0.05&#x000a0;s at the peak strain, and unloading back to the 0.5&#x000a0;N pre-load. From the strain gage data (see &#x0201c;ex vivo strain measurements&#x0201d;), there was no significant difference between vehicle and PTH-treated mice after 29&#x000a0;days of treatment in the 6-week loading study.

Quantification of osteocytic sclerostin staining in the fibula demonstrated that this decrease was statistically significant (vehicle 49&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;7%, iPTH 29&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;4%, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.03, <xref rid="f0040" ref-type="graphic">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Periostin immunohistochemical staining documented strongly positive cells within the intracortical pores (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>f) which, combined with the fluorescent images, is highly suggestive of a dynamic remodelling process in response to iPTH involving osteoclastic bone resorption and osteoblastic bone formation.</p></sec><sec id="s0070"><label>3.3</label><title>Ex vivo strain gaging</title><p>To determine whether treatment with 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg/day iPTH for 4&#x000a0;weeks altered the load:strain relationship, strain gages were attached to the medial surface of the right tibia at the 37% site.

Systemic treatments such as PTH which interact with the mechanostat also have the potential to exert site-specific effects. Therefore, we used the previously-described site-specificity analysis software, <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> to map the effects of iPTH and loading on Ct.Ar, Tt.Ar and Ct.Th across the entire length of bones from the six-week iPTH study (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Loading predominantly increased Ct.Ar and Ct.Th site-specifically in the proximal 50% of the tibia, with minimal effects on Tt.Ar in vehicle-treated mice. iPTH increased Ct.Ar over the proximal 70% of the tibia while reducing Ct.Th in the proximal 50%. Loading of iPTH-treated mice increased Tt.Ar and Ct.Ar in sites within the proximal 30&#x02013;50% of the tibia and also increasing Ct.Th over the proximal 50% of the tibia. This implies that the effects of combining iPTH and loading are additive across the proximal half of the tibia in agreement with the finding at the 37% cortical site (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0090"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p>Although the mechanisms of action of PTH have been extensively studied, the optimal experimental conditions to achieve maximum effects in mouse bones have not been reported. Thus in different studies, different doses and durations of treatment are used and their effects at different skeletal sites of interest analysed, making comparisons between studies difficult. Here we report the effect of four doses and two durations of treatment with iPTH alone and the effect of iPTH on the response of aged rather than young bone to artificial loading. Our data show that in old mice responses to iPTH and loading differ in both their individual and combined effects to those we previously reported in young mice <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>Analysis of the effects of different doses of iPTH on cortical and trabecular bone in the tibia of aged mice demonstrated a dose-dependent effect of iPTH on Tt.Ar and Ct.Ar. This was expected as iPTH has previously been reported to be anabolic on both periosteal and endosteal surfaces of cortical bone in the distal femur <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In contrast, we found no effect of iPTH alone on trabecular bone in the proximal tibia despite being previously reported to be anabolic in the trabecular bone of the L5 vertebra <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. This may reflect the lower trabecular content of the proximal tibia in aged mice compared with the vertebrae. An unexpected finding in the present study was the dramatic intra-cortical remodelling observed in the tibial cortex, particularly with the higher doses of iPTH in aged mice. To our knowledge, this finding has not been reported with intermittent administration of PTH in mice despite other studies using similar doses <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. This difference could reflect the different ages of mice and sites of bone analysed. The result is similar to the phenotype previously reported in the caPTH1R-Dmp1 mice which was shown to exhibit periosteal and endosteal bone formation with marked increases in intracortical remodelling and cortical porosity <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Although the PTH in our study was administered by daily subcutaneous injection, it is possible that the effects of PTH in aged mice are prolonged leading to a phenotype more similar to that observed with continuous activation of PTHR1.</p><p>The intracortical pore formation in the aged mice in our current study appears to be a dynamic process, cathepsin K staining demonstrating an influx of osteoclasts in response to iPTH. This increased number of osteoclasts indicates that the resorption is by osteoclasts rather than any other process such as osteocytic osteolysis <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> and is consistent with PTH's known ability to stimulate bone resorption by enhancing osteoclastogenesis <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The presence of periostin-positive cells within the pores and evidence of bone mineral deposition (from fluorescent labelling) indicates concomitant osteoblastic bone formation. This suggests that iPTH may be stimulating simultaneous bone resorption and formation.</p><p>We had expected from our previous study in young mice <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> that iPTH would interact with mechanical loading resulting in proportionally larger increases in bone mass and architecture than those previously observed in aged mice <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Contrary to our expectation, in trabecular bone iPTH abrogated some of the beneficial effects of mechanical loading; for example on BV/TV and trabecular number. The proximal tibia of aged mice contains very few trabeculae and proportionally fewer than bones such as the vertebra. Nevertheless, the response in aged mice is different from that observed in young mice using the same loading model. This emphasises the importance of being careful when extrapolating responses in young animals to those in old ones. This may be particularly true in the case of PTH as we have recently reported basal and loading-responsive transcriptomic differences between tibiae of young and aged mice <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. These include Wnt signalling and bioenergetics processes, both of which are involved in the anabolic effects of PTH <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.</p><p>In cortical bone, mechanical loading had the same beneficial effects as those previously reported such as a significant increase in cortical area and thickness <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Some of the potentially deleterious effects of iPTH in cortical bone, such as the increase in intracortical porosity and decrease in cortical thickness, were partially rescued by mechanical loading. This is consistent with previously published data. For example, genetic knock down of the BMP1Ra increases cortical porosity which is partially rescued by increased exercise <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p><p>Further elucidation of the different mechanisms of action of iPTH and mechanical loading is likely to be informative. In young mice, when iPTH and loading were combined there was a potentially synergistic response suggesting some commonality, or at least complementarity, between the cellular mechanisms underlying the responses <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. This we hypothesized to be mediated by sclerostin since both loading and iPTH are known to result in its downregulation and therefore increased Wnt signalling <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. However, in aged mice although both loading <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and PTH (this study) cause sclerostin down-regulation there does not appear to be any evidence of interaction between the two responses in terms at least of (re)modelling. This is consistent with a recent study showing that downregulation of Sost mRNA is required for the anabolic effects of loading, but not iPTH in young adult mice <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Thus it may be that deficiencies in the responses of aged mice to iPTH are either independent of sclerostin or occur down-stream of its down-regulation, such as in the recruitment or proliferation of osteoblast cells <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The protein-level down-regulation of sclerostin with iPTH was sustained up to at least six weeks of treatment in the present study, but this did not &#x02018;rejuvenate&#x02019; the magnitude of bone's adaptation to mechanical loading to levels expected in young mice. This suggests that the age-related impairment of bone's adaptation to loading is not entirely explained by more transient down-regulation of sclerostin <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> impairing sustained Wnt signalling activation.</p><p>Osteoblast recruitment and sclerostin regulation are site-specifically influenced by loading <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, potentially-explaining the apparent restriction of osteogenic responses to axial loading to the proximal half of the mouse tibia. The ability of the distal tibia to increase in mass is demonstrated by the significant increase in Ct.Ar below the tibia/fibula junction following iPTH treatment independently of loading, as identified by site-specificity analysis. This analysis provides meaningful additional information and precludes overly-simplistic conclusions drawn from analyses of individual sites. For example, if the main analyses of this study had focused on the tibial mid-shaft (50% site), no response to loading would have been observed and the response to PTH would not have appeared meaningfully increased by loading. Site-specificity analysis therefore represents an important experimental refinement that should prevent erroneous interpretations of experiments based on results from single sites.</p><p>In summary, in aged mice there was only a small effect of iPTH alone on trabecular bone, which was independent of dose although treatment (50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg/day) for six weeks had a stronger effect than two weeks. In trabecular bone, iPTH and loading have no positive interaction, indeed iPTH appears to reduce the positive effects of loading on trabecular number. In contrast, in cortical bone iPTH had a positive osteogenic dose and time-dependent effect. However, in aged mice, unlike in young ones, this effect appears to act independently from the osteogenic effect of loading there being no interaction between the two. Thus the positive interactions between the osteogenic effects of loading and iPTH seen in young animals are not reproduced in old ones where they could therapeutically be most useful. Indeed in trabecular bone the positive interactions seen in young animals were replaced with negative ones in old ones, iPTH inhibiting loading-induced increases in BV/TV. These data reinforce the caution that must be exercised when extrapolating from young populations to old ones.</p><p>The following are the supplementary data related to this article.<fig id="f0040"><label>Supplementary Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Mice were treated with vehicle or 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg/day for 28&#x000a0;days.

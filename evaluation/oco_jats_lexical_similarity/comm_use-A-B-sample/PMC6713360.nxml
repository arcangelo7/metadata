presents with acute onset of sharp chest pain. The incidence of aortic dissection is
3.5/100,000<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. The most common risk factor is hypertension. Other
risk factors include preexisting aortic diseases or aortic valve disease, family
history of aortic diseases, history of cardiac surgery, cigarette smoking, direct
blunt chest trauma and use of intravenous drugs<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Rapid diagnosis and
treatment of acute type A aortic dissections is critical. Dissections involving the
coronary arteries result in higher risk of death and frequently present with
nontraditional symptoms. We present a rare case of a 36-year-old woman with a
complete occlusion of right coronary artery (RCA) due to a Type A aortic
dissection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>CASE REPORT</title><p>A 36-year-old woman was admitted to a township hospital following a sharp chest pain
and profuse sweating. Her medical history included longstanding arterial
hypertension. Twelve-lead electrocardiogram revealed an ST-segment elevation in the
II, III and aVF leads. The diagnosis of acute inferior myocardial infarction was
considered, and the patient was immediately transferred to a local county hospital.
A cardio-pulmonary resuscitation was performed in an ambulance for the sudden onset
of cardiac arrest during the transfer. The vital signs recovered and the hemodynamic
was stable. On day 6, a magnetic resonance imaging was conducted for the persisting
and uncontrolled chest pain and she was diagnosed having a type A aortic dissection.
She was transferred to our hospital by an ambulance. On arrival, her heart rate was
110 beats per minute and blood pressure (BP) was 80/45 mmHg. The Computerized
tomography angiography (CTA) confirmed a Stanford Type A aortic dissection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>) and moderate pericardial effusion was
also identified. The dissecting space of the aorta was thrombotic from the aortic
root to the aortic arch, and the dissection extended from the arch to the level of
the iliac artery. The electrocardiogram showed a pathologic Q wave in the III and
aVF leads. Therefore, the emergent surgery was arranged for this patient
immediately.</p><p>
<fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Preoperative Computerized tomography angiography showing ascending and
descending aortic dissection.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-34-04-0491-g01"/></fig>
</p><p>The surgery was performed in median sternotomy. After pericardiotomy, about 150 ml of
bloody pericardial effusion was removed. The surface of the whole heart and the
dilated ascending aorta were bluish. The right ventricle was motionless. Once a
cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was established, systemic cooling was initiated. The
ascending aorta was clamped just proximal to the brachiocephalic artery and
transected above the sinotubular junction. When beginning to perfuse the heart with
myocardial protection solution directly through the coronary ostium, we found that
the right coronary ostium was totally occluded. Therefore, we opened the right
atrium and administered cold blood cardioplegic solution retrogradely through the
coronary sinus and antegradely through the left coronary ostium. The heart was
arrested completely. After dissecting the RCA, we found RCA was bluish from the
trunk to branches. The true lumen couldn&#x02019;t be found when we opened the RCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). We had to give up coronary artery
bypass grafting (CABG). When rectal temperature decreased to 28&#x02103;&#x0ff0c;the circulation was
arrested. The primary entry tear was found in the lesser curvature of aortic arch.
The selective cerebral perfusion was performed through right axillary artery
cannulation and left common carotid artery. A self-designed 24 mm self-expandable
elephant stent graft was inserted into the true lumen of the descending aorta as the
elephant trunk, and the free vascular graft was located inside the native arch. The
portion of vascular graft, which covered the orifices of 3 vessels, was wedge-shaped
resected. A continuous suture (5-0 Polypropylene) was performed inside the native
arch from the lower edge of the left subclavian artery to the two sides and ran
through the entire native vessel wall around the orifices of the 3 branches to
attach the vascular graft to the native arch. The anastomosis of the proximal of
aortic arch and the vascular graft using a 24-mm Dacron graft with an 8-mm side
branch was accomplished with a continuous suture. Then the prosthesis was de-aired,
we restarted a full CPB through the side branch of the graft, and the patient was
gradually rewarmed. The anastomosis of the reinforced ascending aortic stump and the
vascular graft was accomplished with a continuous end-end suture. Blood pressure and
heartbeat of the patient dramatically dropped during the removal of CPB due to the
large area of myocardial infarction in the right heart, although maximal doses of
vasopressor and inotropic support (dopamine 20.0&#x000b5;g/kg/minute, epinephrine
0.3&#x000b5;g/kg/minute) were given. The patient was failed to wean from CPB.
Peripheral VA-ECMO was implanted with a 22-French Femoral Venous Cannula (Edwards
Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) in the right femoral vein and a 24-French Arterial
Perfusion Cannula (Edwards Lifesciences) grafted to the right femoral artery via an
8 mm beveled Gelweave&#x02122; graft (Terumo, Scotland, UK)". The ECMO circuit
consisted of a centrifugal pump (Revolution 5; Sorin Group, Mirandola, Italy) with a
membrane oxygenator (HLS module advanced; Maquet, Hirrlingen,Germany). When the ECMO
(Pump Rotation: 2367R/min;Blood Flow: 3.880 L/min) started, we stopped the routine
CPB. The patient BP was 89/49 mmHg and central venous pressure (CVP) was 5cm
H<sub>2</sub>O with inotropic support (dopamine 20.0&#x000b5;g/kg/minute,
epinephrine 0.3&#x000b5;g/kg/minute, nitroglycerin 2.0&#x000b5;g/kg/minute). The chest
was closed in the usual fashion. The time of selective cerebral perfusion was 44
minutes, the total circulatory arrest time was 45 minutes, and the CPB time was 239
minutes. When the patient was taken to the ICU, the BP was 90/70mmHg and CVP was
11cm H<sub>2</sub>O. Three hours later, the patient recovered consciousness. The
patient was extubated in 18 hours post-operation. We regularly monitored the changes
of cardiac function through bedside transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). The movement
of the right ventricular wall gradually improved. On day 13 post-operative, ECMO was
removed. The final postoperative TTE revealed that the left ventricular ejection
fraction was 55% and the right ventricular wall moved normally. The patient
recovered uneventfully.</p><p>

</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>A coronary involvement in type A aortic dissection is a serious phenomenon in clinic,
which presents in 10-15% patients with aortic dissection<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Clinical research has
shown that the mortality rate of a type A aortic dissection involving the coronary
artery is high (up to 20% ~ 33.3%) after surgery<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. According to Neri et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>,
there are three mechanisms of total occlusion of right coronary ostium: type A,
where ostial dissection is defined as a disruption of the inner layer limited to the
area of the coronary ostium; type B, a dissection extending into the coronary
artery; and type C, a coronary disruption (intimal detachment). The ideal treatment
for this condition is surgery with ascending aorta replacement and CABG or a
coronary repair, if possible. In our patient, acute Type A aortic dissection was
accompanied with myocardial infarction and pericardial effusion. Without prompt
treatment, it will result in death due to myocardial infarction or aortic rupture.
The RCA dissection was already suspected based on the presence of pathologic Q on
ECG on the patient&#x02019;s arrival. But in the surgery, we found RCA was bluish from the
trunk to branches, and the RCA was totally thrombosed. The true lumen couldn&#x02019;t be
found when we opened the RCA. There was no place available for CABG on the RCA. The
follow-up CTA also demonstrated that the RCA was totally occluded, except for a
small caliber true lumen visualized. After a regular surgery of Stanford type A
aortic dissection, the patient was difficult to wean from CPB due to the right heart
dysfunction. In this case, we excluded consideration of an intra-aortic balloon pump
because of the residual dissected thoracoabdominal aorta. The only option left was
to continue to use assisted circulation which helped myocardial recovery. The right
ventricular circulatory support was another option, but was not approved for use in
China. Besides, we had more experience on installing ECMO on patients with right
ventricular failure and got satisfied outcomes. So, we chose ECMO to assist right
heart function. As expected, the hemodynamic parameters were favorable after
initiation of ECMO, and the right ventricular wall motion was gradually improved
during the post-operation period.</p><p>This is the first report of using ECMO to successfully treat a complete occlusion of
the RCA, when CABG can&#x02019;t be performed due to a Stanford Type A aortic dissection.
This case demonstrates the value of ECMO in assisting right heart function to ensure
stable hemodynamics and myocardial recovery in the type A aortic dissection with
coronary involvement.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="5%" span="1"/><col width="95%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Author's roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">YW</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Collected the date and wrote the article;

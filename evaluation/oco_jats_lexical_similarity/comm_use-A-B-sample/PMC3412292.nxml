This poorly elucidated process might be influenced by (i) rosettes, i.e. npRBCs cytoadherent to haemozoin-containing parasitized RBCs (pRBCs) and (ii) generation in pRBCs of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) through haemozoin-catalysed lipid peroxidation. We explored whether close proximity in rosettes may facilitate 4-HNE transfer to npRBCs, which is likely to enhance their phagocytosis and contribute to malaria anaemia. Fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry data indicated 4-HNE transfer to npRBCs in rosettes. Rosettes were formed by 64&#x000b7;8 &#x000b1; 1&#x000b7;8% varO-expressing pRBCs, and 8&#x000b7;7 &#x000b1; 1&#x000b7;1% npRBCs were positive for 4-HNE-protein-conjugates, while low-rosetting parasites generated only 2&#x000b7;4 &#x000b1; 1&#x000b7;1% 4-HNE-conjugate-positive npRBCs. 4-HNE transfer decreased after blocking rosetting by monoclonal antibodies. A positive linear relationship between rosette frequency and 4-HNE-conjugates in npRBCs was found in 40 malaria patients, a first indication for a role of rosetting in npRBCs modifications <italic>in vivo.</italic> Children with severe malaria anaemia had significantly higher percentages of 4-HNE-conjugate-positive npRBCs compared to children with uncomplicated malaria. In conclusion, 4-HNE transfer from pRBCs to npRBCs in rosettes is suggested to play a role in the phagocytic removal of large numbers of npRBCs, the hallmark of severe malaria anaemia.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>malaria</kwd><kwd>malarial anaemia</kwd><kwd>rosette</kwd><kwd>4-hydroxynonenal</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Rosetting is a specialized form of cytoadherence of late haemozoin (HZ)-containing forms of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>-parasitized red blood cells (pRBCs) to non-parasitized (np)RBCs. Rosetting intensity is positively associated with malaria complications, such as severe malaria anaemia and cerebral malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Rowe <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Mercereau-Puijalon <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Mayor <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). While microvascular obstruction, tissue hypoxia and acidosis resulting from rosetting and cytoadherence to endothelia may contribute to cerebral malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Dondorp <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>), the mechanisms by which rosetting provokes severe malaria anaemia, notably in the hallmark massive removal of npRBCs, is unexplored. Membrane lipid modifications, including a decreased content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acid, have been described in np-RBCs co-cultured with p-RBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Beaumelle &#x00026; Vial, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Omodeo-Sale <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). Natural HZ (nHZ), produced in large amounts in mature pRBCs and conservatively isolated from pRBC cultures, has a crystalline scaffold of ferriprotoporphyrin IX molecules from undigested haemoglobin haem bound to host and parasite proteins and lipids, notably PUFAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Schwarzer <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">2003</xref>). Haem iron of HZ is able to peroxidize PUFAs and generate the terminal aldehyde 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) present in micromolar concentrations in late parasite forms and able to diffuse to adjacent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Skorokhod <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">2010</xref>).

We also performed <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies in patients presenting with clinical malaria to see whether the frequency of rosetting parasites correlated with the percentage of npRBCs carrying 4-HNE conjugates. Finally, we examined whether the frequency of npRBCs carrying 4-HNE conjugates was higher in anaemic than in non-anaemic children.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All chemicals were from Sigma (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) if not otherwise stated.</p><sec><title>In vitro culture of varO 89F5 P. falciparum in human RBCs</title><p>The varO expressing variant of the 89F5 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strain (varO parasites, a well-characterized rosetting parasite line, provided by O.

Cultures were followed up for rosette frequency and varO expression as described below. To obtain parasite cultures with different rosetting frequencies of the same parasite line, after separation on ficoll, varO cultures were divided into high and low rosetting subpopulations, which were found in pellet and supernatant respectively, and kept in separate cultures.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of 4-HNE transfer in rosettes</title><p>To determine the role of rosettes for 4-HNE transfer from p- to npRBCs, in a first approach schizonts from high and low rosetting cultures were enriched to &#x0003e;90% parasitaemia at the 40/60% interface of a discontinuous percoll gradient as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Schwarzer <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). Parasites were collected and re-infection started by adding washed RBCs from freshly drawn blood from healthy donors (blood group O Rh<sup>+</sup>) adjusting parasitaemia to 2%. The cultures were kept under rotation at 40 rpm. At 40-h post-reinfection, rosette frequency, varO expression in mature parasites, parasitaemia and 4-HNE conjugates on the npRBCs were assayed. As the 4-HNE-protein conjugates in npRBC were not significantly increased (19&#x000b7;5 &#x000b1; 1&#x000b7;8%; <italic>N</italic> = 3, <italic>P</italic> = 0&#x000b7;25) with increasing parasitaemia (15 vs. 5%) in <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures, all <italic>in vitro</italic> assays were performed at defined parasitaemias between 2&#x000b7;5 and 5% to exclude this rosette-independent variation.

The RBCs were then spun, the supernatant containing the unbound dye carefully removed and RBCs washed three times with PBSGlc-BSA. Opsonization of RBCs with IgG anti-D (Rhophylac, ZLB Behring, King of Prussia, PA, USA) at 750 units/ml packed RBCs was performed at 30% haematocrit at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 min with subsequent washes in PBSGlc-BSA. THP-1 cells were grown in suspension in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 &#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin (complete medium). Before starting phagocytosis, the THP-1 cells were stimulated with &#x003b3;-interferon (IFN-&#x003b3;, 50 units/ml) and tumour necrosis factor &#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;, 250 units/ml) for 24 h to enhance their phagocytic activity. Then, cells were washed three times with RPMI 1640 medium and suspended in complete medium. Phagocytosis was started by adding a) stained or non-stained, b) opsonized or non-opsonized RBCs at a RBC/phagocyte ratio of 200:1, and performed at 37&#x000b0;C in a humidified CO<sub>2</sub>/air-incubator for 3 h.

The latter exceeds the lysis of pRBCs by approximately 10-fold and is thus considered to be the most important factor leading to anaemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Jakeman <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>).</p><p>The present data, obtained <italic>in vitro</italic> and validated by <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies in patients, may provide a mechanism that explains how pRBCs damage adjacent npRBCs in rosettes and target those to phagocytic removal. Such a mechanism is based on the transfer of 4-HNE from pRBCs to npRBCs in rosettes. 4-HNE, produced in pRBCs as a final product of PUFAs peroxidation mediated by nHZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Schwarzer <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Skorokhod <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), has been shown to diffuse out of the producing cells either into the blood or extracellular fluid, or to adjacent cytoadherent cells where it may rapidly form covalent conjugates with cysteine, lysine and histidine residues in proteins (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Poli <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). For example, 4-HNE was shown to diffuse from nHZ-laden monocytes to adjacent erythroid precursors and to inhibit their maturation to RBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Skorokhod <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). Binding of 4-HNE to proteins is very rapid, reaching a maximum approximately 3 min after 4-HNE supplementation to isolated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Siems &#x00026; Grune, 2003</xref>). Due to its lipophilic tail, 4-HNE preferentially concentrates in the membrane of the target cells. In fact, we have shown that when npRBCs are supplemented with low-micromolar concentrations of 4-HNE, conjugates were formed with membrane or cytoskeletal proteins, such as spectrin, band 3, and actin (Table SI) and resulted in decreased RBC deformability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Skorokhod <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>) and enhanced RBC phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig 2</xref>). Thus, 4-HNE production in pRBCs may account for 4-HNE binding to membrane proteins of npRBCs in rosettes followed by increased membrane rigidity and their flagging as damaged cells and phagocytic removal by organ phagocytes, contributing to the development of malarial anaemia.</p><p>In varO-positive cultures with a rosette frequency of 64&#x000b7;9%, 8&#x000b7;7% of co-cultured npRBCs were 4-HNE-positive, while only 2&#x000b7;4% of co-cultured npRBCs were 4-HNE-positive in the low-rosetting culture. Additionally, blocking the rosetting capacity of trophozoites by antibodies resulted in decreasing the rosette frequency by about 56% and of 4-HNE-labelling of npRBCs by about 60%. The fourfold greater positivity for 4-HNE conjugates in the npRBCs of the high-rosetting culture may explain a significantly higher phagocytic removal of those npRBCs.</p><p>Data obtained from patients admitted with acute malaria infection are in agreement with the above sequence and mechanism. First, <italic>ex vivo</italic> data obtained with separated RBCs from these patients kept in culture for 24 h to obtain mature rosetting parasites, demonstrate a significant positive correlation between the percentage of 4-HNE-positive npRBCs and rosette frequency. In patients with the high-rosetting phenotype, 4-HNE-membrane modifications in npRBCs were independent of parasitaemia. In fact, the vast majority (75%) of those patients displayed 4-HNE conjugates on more than 10% of their np-RBCs. In contrast, non- or low-rosetting parasites elicited similar rates of 4-HNE conjugates only in 50% of patients. This strengthens the idea that the rosette formation consistently contributes to the oxidative modification of npRBCs <italic>in vivo</italic>, and indicates that direct transfer of 4-HNE produced in the maturing parasite is facilitated by the intimate contact of p- and npRBCs in the rosette. As to the remarkable formation of 4-HNE conjugates <italic>in vivo</italic>, additional factors, such as cytoadherence of p- and npRBCs during extensive microvascular obstructions observed in severe malaria <italic>in vivo</italic>, may contribute to 4-HNE formation and transfer of 4-HNE conjugates in npRBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Schmidt <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Dondorp <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Second, the percentage of npRBCs positive for 4-HNE conjugates was significantly higher in patients presenting with anaemia than in their non-anaemic counterparts, confirming that oxidative membrane modifications &#x02013; probably driven by rosette formation- may play a role in the excess removal of npRBCs in malaria anaemia.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that 4-HNE, a HZ-generated terminal product of PUFA peroxidation, can be transferred from pRBCs to npRBCs in rosettes. As normal RBCs treated with plausible amounts of 4-HNE were altered and intensely phagocytosed, it is proposed that rosettes may be instrumental in eliciting the removal of large numbers of npRBCs, a characteristic hallmark of severe malaria anaemia. Malaria patients&#x02019; data are in agreement with this mechanism.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We wish to thank Jennifer Musyoki for assistance with the processing of the samples from malaria patients, Peter Bull for logistic and intellectual support (all from KEMRI/Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kilifi) and Dr Odile Mercereau-Puijalon, Pasteur Institute, Paris, for generously providing the varO expressing variant of the 89F5 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strain and the mouse monoclonal antibody against the rNTS-DBL1&#x003b1; domain of varO (varO-MAB).

The exact function of YAP in bone homeostasis remains controversial. Here we provide evidence for YAP&#x02019;s function in promoting osteogenesis, suppressing adipogenesis, and thus maintaining bone homeostasis. YAP is selectively expressed in osteoblast (OB)-lineage cells. Conditionally knocking out <italic>Yap</italic> in the OB lineage in mice reduces cell proliferation and OB differentiation and increases adipocyte formation, resulting in a trabecular bone loss. Mechanistically, YAP interacts with &#x003b2;-catenin and is necessary for maintenance of nuclear &#x003b2;-catenin level and Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling. Expression of &#x003b2;-catenin in YAP-deficient BMSCs (bone marrow stromal cells) diminishes the osteogenesis deficit. These results thus identify YAP-&#x003b2;-catenin as an important pathway for osteogenesis during adult bone remodeling and uncover a mechanism underlying YAP regulation of bone homeostasis.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="LongSummary"><title>Bone homeostasis: Genes play a balancing act</title><p id="Par120">A key regulatory gene both promotes bone formation and suppresses production of fat-storing bone marrow cells, thus supporting the key process of bone remodeling. As adults, our bones are in a constant state of flux, constantly being dissolved and rebuilt to maintain a steady state known as homeostasis. An international team led by Wen-Cheng Xiong, of Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, studied the role of the gene &#x02018;yes-associated protein&#x02019; (YAP), a transcription factor (gene controlling the activity of other genes). Using mice, they found that YAP is essential for osteogenesis, and prevents adipocyte (fat-storing cell) formation. Without a functional YAP gene, mice experienced a loss of a softer type of bone known as trabecular bone. The molecular pathways controlled by YAP may thus be important for bone remodeling in vertebrates.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">YAP (yes-associated protein) is a transcriptional cofactor that is highly related to TAZ (transcriptional co-activator with PDZ binding motif).

Such an inconsistency might be due to a compensatory increase of bone formation in the periosteum cortical region, thus resulting in a balanced cortical bone volume, with increased Ec. and Ps. perimeters in the cortical bones of Yap-CKO mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2o, r&#x02013;u</xref>).

However, our results support the notion for YAP as a target of SOX2, because OB-specific SOX2-CKO results in similar bone deficits as that of Yap<sup>Ocn-Cre</sup> mice: lower bone density, cell senescence in osteoprogenitors, and reduced bone formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> The exact reason(s) for the controversial results regarding YAP regulation of osteogenesis/adipogenesis remains unclear, which might have resulted from different MSCs from different age groups of mice examined.</p><p id="Par25">Notice that, in addition to the OB-lineage, Ocn-Cre-driven Td was detected in fractional non-OB-lineage cells, including chondrocytes in the GP (~30%), CXCL12<sup>+</sup> CAR-like cells (~30%), and NG2<sup>+</sup> pericytes (~15%) in the bone marrow (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f, i&#x02013;k</xref> and data not shown), in line with the report by Zhang and Link,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and raising a concern about the specificity of the Ocn-Cre driver. Although Ocn-Cre is expressed in fractions of non-OB-lineage cells, the following observations led us to believe that YAP in the OB lineage plays a critical role in promoting OB genesis. First, Ocn-Cre is largely expressed in the OB lineage, with nearly 100% of OB-lineage cells (including OBs in the Tb, lining cells, and osteocytes in the cortical bone) marked by Ocn-Cre-driven Td (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1i&#x02013;k</xref>, and Supplemental Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). In cultured BMSCs, although Ocn-Cre-driven Td over total BMSCs was low (&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;30%)(Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), upon differentiation with proper factors, these cells committed to ALP<sup>+</sup> OBs, but not to anti-perilipin-marked adipocytes (Supplemental Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Second, BMSCs derived from Yap<sup>Ocn-Cre</sup> mice exhibited impaired OB genesis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), eliminating a possible role of YAP in NG2<sup>+</sup> cells in this event, as NG2<sup>+</sup>YAP<sup>+</sup> cells were undetectable in this type of cultures (Supplemental Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1G</xref> and data not shown). Third, Ocn-Cre<sup>+</sup> cells in BMSCs were increased upon in vitro OB differentiation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref> and Supplemental Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1D, E</xref>) and decreased when Yap was knocked out (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a&#x02013;e</xref>). Fourth, the decrease of Ocn-Cre<sup>+</sup> cells in BMSC cultures correlated well with the deficits of both in vitro OB genesis and in vivo bone formation. Considering all of these observations, we propose that the defects in both in vitro OB genesis and in vivo assays are largely due to YAP depletion in Ocn-Cre<sup>+</sup> OB-lineage cells.</p><p id="Par26">Whereas our results suggest a critical function of YAP in Ocn-Cre<sup>+</sup> OB-lineage cells for OB genesis, the functions of YAP in Ocn-Cre<sup>+</sup> non-OB-linage cells remain unclear. It remains a possibility for YAP in these cells to negatively regulate adipocyte formation from BMSCs. It is also possible for YAP in these cells (e.g., chondrocytes) to regulate chondrocyte&#x02019;s function, given that Yap1 deletion in Col2a1-Cre<sup>+</sup> cells impairs early chondrocyte proliferation but increases subsequent maturation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> However, our preliminary examinations of GP structure (by H&#x00026;E staining) and function (by Safranin O staining) showed no obvious alteration in Yap<sup>Ocn-Cre</sup> mice (data not shown).

We hypothesize that YAP stabilizes &#x003b2;-catenin and thus increases nuclear &#x003b2;-catenin-mediated osteogenesis. This is supported by our results that YAP co-expressed with &#x003b2;-catenin in OB-lineage cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>); YAP-deficiency in OBs reduces cytoplasmic and nuclear &#x003b2;-catenin levels in culture and in vivo (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c, f</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and Supplemental Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>-<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>); expression of YAP in Yap-KO MC3T3 cells increased &#x003b2;-catenin (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5k, l</xref>); and expression of &#x003b2;-catenin in Yap-deficient BMSCs could diminish OB genesis deficit (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Whereas our results favor the model for YAP as a positive regulator of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling and osteogenesis, YAP/TAZ has been reported to play both positive and negative roles in Wnt signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> For example, YAP is required for stabilization of Smad1/5/8 but not &#x003b2;-catenin in astrocytes in the brain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> Park et al. report that overexpression of YAP-5SA mutant in MCF10A cells (a breast cancer cell line) decreases &#x003b2;-catenin levels and inhibits Wnt signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> thus conclude a negative role of YAP/TAZ on Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling.

These controversial results may be due to different cell lines used. YAP may regulate &#x003b2;-catenin not only at the cytoplasmic level but also in the nucleus, in a cell-type-dependent manner. These observations also highlight a need for further investigation of YAP regulation of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling. In addition to YAP-&#x003b2;-catenin signaling, other mechanisms may underlie YAP regulation of osteogenesis.

Whereas this speculation remains to be further tested in future, other possibility exists. For examples, YAP in Ocn-Cre<sup>+</sup> OB-lineage cells may regulate adipocyte differentiation from MSCs in a cell-non-autonomous manner.

Alternatively, YAP in Ocn-Cre<sup>+</sup> non-OB-lineage cells (e.g., CXCL12<sup>+</sup> CAR cells) may play a role in suppressing adipogenesis.

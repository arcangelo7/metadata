He expanded the health workforce by 38 000 health extension workers and initiated financing mechanisms to expand health insurance coverage. </p><p>He has also served as chair of the boards of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and the Roll Back Malaria Partnership, as well as being co-chair of the Board of the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn &#x00026; Child Health.</p><p>He succeeds Dr Margaret Chan who has been WHO&#x02019;s Director-General since 1&#x000a0;January 2007.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2017/director-general-elect/">http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2017/director-general-elect/</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>Data on attacks on health </title><p>A total of 302 attacks on health facilities, health workers and ambulances were reported across 20 countries last year, according to data gathered by WHO, in which 372 people died and 491 people were injured. </p><p>Such attacks have serious consequences for health service delivery, often killing and injuring patients and providers, and depriving people of care in conflict-affected countries. </p><p>Most (207/302) of the attacks were reported in the Syrian Arab Republic, followed by 20 in Libya, 18 in the Central African Republic, 11 in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and nine in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Two thirds or 207 were on health-care facilities, 52 on health workers, 40 on ambulances and three on patients. </p><p>WHO started analysing reports on attacks on health care, in countries facing emergencies, from secondary sources and consolidating these data in 2014. According to a report released last year based on these data, WHO reported 256 such attacks in 2015 and 338 in 2014. The data are not comprehensive but give an idea of the magnitude of the problem. </p><p> &#x0201c;While we recognize that we are not capturing all data, and that there is significant underreporting, this is the only existing consolidation of global data on individual attacks on health care in emergency contexts,&#x0201d; the statement said.</p><p>These attacks on health workers and health care often contravene international humanitarian law. WHO condemned the attacks and continues to advocate for an end to such attacks in all settings.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/emergencies/attacks-on-health-care">http://www.who.int/emergencies/attacks-on-health-care</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>Cholera resurgence </title><p>WHO and its partners have been responding to a resurgence of cholera in parts of Yemen that has claimed more than 601 lives and caused more than 73 762 cases as of 1 June.</p><p>WHO distributed medicines and medical supplies, including cholera kits, oral rehydration solutions and intravenous fluids as well as medical furniture and equipment for diarrhoea treatment centres. </p><p>The centres have been rolled out across 18 of Yemen&#x02019;s 19 target governorates that are affected by cholera, according to Dr Nevio Zagaria, WHO Representative in Yemen.</p><p>The cholera outbreak in Yemen was announced by Yemen&#x02019;s health ministry in October 2016. An estimated 7.6 million people live in areas at high risk of cholera.</p><p>The resurgence comes as Yemen&#x02019;s already weakened health system struggles under the weight of two years of conflict. Key infrastructure, including water and sanitation facilities, is collapsing, contributing to the spread of diarrhoeal disease. </p><p>The weather is also playing a role: the pathogens that cause cholera are more likely to spread in warmer weather and recent heavy rains have washed piles of uncollected waste into water sources.</p><p>&#x0201c;We are very concerned with the re-emergence of cholera across several areas of Yemen in the past couple of weeks. Efforts must be scaled-up now to contain the outbreak and avoid a dramatic increase in cases of diarrhoeal disease,&#x0201d; Zagaria said. </p><p>Cholera is an acute diarrhoeal infection caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium <italic>Vibrio cholera</italic> that can be fatal. </p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.emro.who.int/media/news/who-responds-to-resurgent-cholera-in-yemen.html">http://www.emro.who.int/media/news/who-responds-to-resurgent-cholera-in-yemen.html</ext-link></p><boxed-text id="Bb" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Cover photo </title></caption><p>To address climate change and other issues affecting the world&#x02019;s oceans seas, a United Nations conference was held in New York from 5 to 9 June to support the implementation of sustainable development goal 14: conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.

This will help to better control the rise of antibiotic resistant bacteria in those sectors. </p><p>The updated version entitled <italic>Critically important antimicrobials for human medicine 5th Revision 2016</italic> divides antimicrobial classes into three priority groups of critically important, highly important and important. </p><p>The list was first published in 2005 in response to increasing calls for action to curb antimicrobial resistance associated with the food chain. </p><p>Antibiotics are grouped in classes and categorized as &#x0201c;critically important&#x0201d; when this class represents one of very few therapies or the only therapy capable of treating certain serious bacterial infections in people, and are used to treat infections where the bacteria or their resistance genes may be transmitted to humans from nonhuman sources. </p><p>&#x0201c;Critically important&#x0201d; antibiotics include those that are frequently used in humans and where a large number of people are affected by bacterial diseases for which the antibiotic is the sole or one of few alternatives to treat the infections in humans.

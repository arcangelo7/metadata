A meta-analysis of 17 community-based studies found that obese people were 1.18 times more likely to have depressive symptoms than those who were not obese, with this association more clearly present among women than men.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Evidence of a reciprocal relationship between depression and excess weight was found in a meta-analysis of longitudinal studies.<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Overweight and obesity increased the odds of subsequent depression by 1.27 and 1.55 respectively, while depression increased the odds of obesity at follow-up by 1.58.<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> This relationship has been suggested to be dose dependent, with a higher body mass index (BMI) being linked to a greater likelihood of clinical depression.<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Impact of comorbid depression and obesity</title><p>Depression and obesity are both associated with social stigma, low self-esteem, and chronic health conditions.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> When depression and obesity co-occur, the adverse health and social consequences are significant. Symptoms of depression in obese patients are strongly associated with poor quality of life, particularly social functioning, emotional roles, and mental health.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Further, obesity coupled with depression has significant economic implications, owing to high service use<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and reduced participation in the labour force.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p></sec><sec><title>GPs&#x02019; role in the detection and management of obesity and depression</title><p>In many countries, including Australia, the UK, and Canada, clinical practice guidelines recommend that GPs play a role in the management of both obesity and depression.<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Recent data from Australia&#x02019;s Bettering the Evaluation and Care of Health (BEACH) study of GP encounters found that depression was the fifth most frequently managed problem, and weight and nutrition counselling was the most common preventative treatment administered.<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The frequency with which these conditions are encountered in primary care suggests that GPs may need to be equipped to recognise and provide comprehensive care to patients with comorbid depression and obesity.</p></sec><sec><title>Limited information of the prevalence of comorbid depression and obesity</title><p>While there are numerous community studies on depression and obesity,<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> there are limited data on the prevalence of comorbid obesity and depression in the general practice setting. The frequency with which comorbid depression and obesity occur in general practice is important because of the implications for its detection and management. For example, some somatic criteria for the diagnosis of depression, such as sleep problems, fatigue, or changes in appetite, could be confounded with manifestations of obesity.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> While interventions for weight management, such as exercise, may also be helpful in managing depression, there are no protocols for providing integrated treatment of these health conditions. Therefore, if comorbid depression and obesity is a common presentation, the development and testing of models of care to facilitate GPs to recognise and treat these multiple conditions is likely to be indicated. This study aimed to examine the prevalence of depression among underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese patients in general practice.</p><boxed-text position="float"><sec><title>How this fits in</title><p>Previous research suggests a reciprocal relationship between depression and obesity; however, there has been limited study of the relationship between weight and depression in the Australian general practice setting. The results of this study indicate a U-shaped relationship exists between depression and weight, with a higher prevalence of depression observed among both underweight and obese patients. The findings suggest that these conditions may act as red flags for opportunistic screening of depression in the general practice setting.</p></sec></boxed-text></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHOD</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Design and setting</title><p>A cross-sectional survey was conducted among primary care patients in 12 practices in Australia.

The sex of non-consenters was recorded, to assess consent bias. Consenting patients completed a 15-minute touchscreen computer survey while waiting for their appointment. Patients called into their appointment were able to exit the survey. The survey assessed a range of health risk factors and behaviours; however, only results relating to depression and obesity are presented here.

Depression was more prevalent among women across all BMI categories except underweight.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The multi-site nature of the current study is a strength; however, the low practice consent rate raises the possibility that participating practices were not representative of the general practice setting. This is mitigated by a high participant consent rate, indicating that the sample was representative of participating practices.</p><p>The use of self-reported data on height and weight to calculate BMI may have resulted in an underestimation of BMI. However, the reliability of self-reported weight and height data collected for the current study were assessed with measured data collected for a subset of participants, and substantial agreement was found between self-report and measured categorisation of BMI.<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Given the low number of people reporting both underweight and depression in the current study, the results pertaining to this group must be treated with caution. The PHQ-9 has been shown to have high sensitivity and specificity in the general practice setting. However, it is a screening tool, and does not provide a clinical diagnosis of depression. Therefore, there is likely to be some degree of measurement error in the rates of depression reported for each BMI category.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with existing literature</title><p>While there are limited studies in the general practice setting, two large community-based studies conducted in the US and the Netherlands, involving 40 086 and 43 534 participants respectively, reported similar U-shaped associations between BMI and depression.<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Consistent with the current study, both studies used self-reported measures to collect data on height, weight, and depressive symptoms.</p><p>The point prevalence of depression among obese patients in the current study was 23% and is higher than the 14% reported in a previous study from one family practice clinic in the US.<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In the latter study, depression rates were based on a documented diagnosis of depression in the electronic medical record. The strong evidence that depression is under-detected in primary care<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> is likely to account for the difference in prevalence reported. Past research sheds some light on the possible reasons for the high prevalence of depression among obese people. Factors associated with obesity, such as stigmatisation; discrimination in health care, education, and employment;<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> low self-esteem; and body dissatisfaction,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> can contribute to or exacerbate depressive illness in an obese person.<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Conversely, features of depression may also cause or exacerbate weight problems and obesity. This includes prominent symptoms of depression, such as physical inactivity and weight gain, as well as weight gain attributed to antidepressant medication, major depressive episodes, or endocrine disturbance.<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>Previous studies that have assessed the association between underweight and depression have focused specifically on individuals with eating disorders, which may not accurately reflect the general population of underweight individuals.<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Therefore, there are limited data with which to compare the present finding of a 24% prevalence rate for depression among underweight individuals. The few community studies that have examined the association between depression and underweight report inconsistent results.<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Depressive disorders are characterised by changes in eating behaviour, both overeating and under-eating, and weight changes, both significant weight gain and loss, and this is listed as a core diagnostic criterion according to the <italic>Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders</italic> (DSM-5).<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> While a decrease in food intake might be less common than an increase in food intake, these behaviours could partially explain the U-shaped association between depression and body weight.<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>Rates of depression were higher among women than men across all BMI categories, except for the underweight category. However, it should be noted that only a small number of men were underweight (<italic>n</italic> = 6, 1.2%); therefore, these data must be interpreted with caution. An association between psychopathology and underweight among men has also been reported in community samples,<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> suggesting that the current finding warrants further investigation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Implications for research and practice</title><p>Given the paucity of prior research examining the prevalence of depression by BMI categories among general practice attendees, further research is needed to confirm the current findings and to determine the extent to which they can be generalised within the primary care setting in Australia and overseas. The data from this study indicated that rates of depression history among people with elevated PHQ-9 scores were similar across BMI categories. Similarly, there were no differences in the rate of depressed people who consulted their GP on three or more occasions in the past 12 months. Therefore, it would be useful for future research to investigate whether other factors may discriminate between those who are underweight and depressed and those who are obese and depressed. This may provide some insights into the impact of depression when associated with underweight or obesity, and assist in developing intervention approaches in this setting.</p><p>Both underweight and obesity may act a potential red flag for opportunistic screening for depression. The relatively high rates of depression among both underweight and obese participants in the present study suggest that these conditions may need to be addressed in combination. Given that both conditions are associated with stigma,<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> GPs may be reluctant to raise issues of weight and/or depression with patients for whom this is not the primary reason for presenting for care.<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Therefore, exploration into the most effective ways of discussing the potential comorbidity of obesity and depression is needed.</p><p>In addition to aiding weight management,<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> there is some evidence suggesting that exercise may improve mood.<xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Therefore, exercise interventions integrated into depression treatment may be valuable among depressed patients who are underweight or obese. Similarly, depression screening and treatment may be beneficial alongside health-behaviour interventions for obesity. Despite their co-occurrence, there are no models for providing combined treatment for depression and obesity, and this is an important area for research. One of the key questions that remain unanswered is whether it is more effective to target these conditions simultaneously or sequentially. The importance of developing evidence-based approaches for tackling these two major health problems in an integrated way is highlighted by the present finding that almost one-quarter of those who were obese or underweight reported depression.</p></sec></sec></body><back><notes><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by a grant from beyondblue and the National Heart Foundation of Australia Strategic Research Partnership [G 08S 4042].</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics approval</title><p>The study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committees of the University of Newcastle, University of New South Wales, and Monash University (H-2009-0341).</p></sec><sec><title>Provenance</title><p>Freely submitted; externally peer reviewed.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors have declared no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Discuss this article</title><p>Contribute and read comments about this article: <bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.bjgp.org/letters">www.bjgp.org/letters</ext-link></bold></p></sec></notes><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="b1"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>World Health Organization</collab></person-group><source>Depression.

than blunt trauma<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Among this class of injuries, axillary artery
injuries are the most uncommon. Although rare, axillary artery injuries must be
managed with prudent consideration to prevent complications such as hemorrhage,
ischemia, and pseudo-aneurysm<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.
Surgical management is an extensive strategy and requires aggressive dissection with
a high risk of injury to surrounding structures. Endovascular management has been
found to reduce the operative time, cost, and exposure to general anesthesia, local
dissection, and potential injury to other structures<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. Here, we report a successful endovascular
management of a vascular injury in the upper limb. Consent was obtained from the
patient to publish the obtained images and his clinical history.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>CASE REPORT</title><p>A 16-year-old boy was admitted with a gunshot injury on the upper left side of the
chest. He received initial treatment in another hospital while in shock and
hypoxemic with a Glasgow coma scale score of 14. Thereafter, he was transferred to
our facility with stable hemodynamics following resuscitation and placement of a
chest tube. The gunshot entry point was approximately 1 cm below and lateral to the
midclavicular line, and the exit point was just lateral to the scapular spine
posteriorly, leaving a non-expanding and non-pulsatile chest hematoma. Bilateral
radial, ulnar, and brachial pulses were palpable. The patient showed signs of
brachial plexus injury and was not able to extend his wrist. Furthermore, he
experienced impaired sensation in his upper left limb.</p><p>A computed tomography angiogram of the chest revealed a distinct 5 x 5-mm
pseudo-aneurysm in the third part of the axillary artery just proximal to the
posterior origin of the circumflex humeral artery. A well-defined regional hematoma
was adjacent to that segment of the artery, and no active bleeding was noted. The
left brachial artery was accessed in the angio suite, confirming the computed
tomography findings with diagnostic angiography. Some contrast extraversion was also
observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). Using a 7-F sheath, one 6
x 50 mm VIABAHN<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>-covered stent (W. L. Gore &#x00026; Associates,
Flagstaff, Arizona, USA) was placed over the injury site to cover the origin of the
posterior circumflex humeral artery. A 6&#x000d7;100-mm non-compliable balloon was
inflated through the stent to ensure complete sealing of the arterial segment.
Finally, completion angiography revealed exclusion of the pseudo-aneurism and patent
blood flow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>

</p><p>The patient was discharged 3 days after the procedure with take-home medication of 81
mg of aspirin orally once a day. During the 1-month follow-up, duplex scanning
revealed normal flow velocities at the patent stent. After 6 months, the patient
underwent brachial plexus repair, and a cast was applied postoperatively. During the
sixth follow-up visit (8 months post-procedure), he was readmitted because the pulse
in his left radial and brachial arteries was not palpable. An urgent duplex scan
showed in-stent stenosis with a velocity of 385 cm/s. The next day, a diagnostic
angiograph confirmed these findings and also revealed severe stenosis in the stent
with a smooth outline and a long segment of arterial stenosis distal to the stent.
Balloon angioplasty of the stent and a distal arterial segment were performed using
a 6 x16-mm stent as well as a completion angiogram. The patient was then instructed
to take 75 mg of clopidogrel daily in addition to aspirin. Clopidogrel was
discontinued 3 months after the second procedure. Monthly duplex scanning conducted
for four months, then twice yearly, and then yearly revealed normal velocities in
the left upper limb arteries.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Endovascular procedures are accepted as management options for penetrating traumatic
injuries. Traditionally, open exposure and vessel repair are performed through
sternotomy or thoracotomy exposure<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. These procedures
are time-consuming and pose a risk of collateral injury to the surrounding
neurovascular structure. Endovascular procedures have overcome the problems
associated with open exposure procedures and are being adopted more often. In the
last 10 years, the rate of trauma-associated deaths has increased faster than that
of deaths among the general population<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>, and penetrating
trauma accounts for a significant fraction of these deaths. Traumatic artery
injuries, such as injuries in the axillosubclavian region, have high rates of
morbidity and mortality<sup>5,6)]</sup>, This high rate of morbidity and mortality
could be explained because of the need for extensive dissection required in such
region on top of the nature of the injury. Under these conditions, endovascular
procedures benefit patients much more than traditional exposure and open repair. The
Endovascular Skills for Trauma and Resuscitative Surgery Working Group reported that
endovascular procedures were successful in 96.9% of patients.<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> Branco et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> analyzed the positive impact of
endovascular therapy in patients with sustained axillosubclavian arterial injuries
and found a statistically significant difference in mortality: 5.6% for endovascular
repair <italic>versus</italic> 27.8% for open repair. These authors also showed that
patients treated with endovascular repair tended to have lower rates of
complications, particularly surgical-site infections and sepsis.</p><p>We used endovascular procedures to treat a penetrating axillary artery injury. More
importantly, our long-term cautious therapeutic plan saved the patient's life and
afforded him high-quality health. Endovascular procedures have recently been
introduced as treatment options for traumatic artery injury and minimized injury to
surrounding neurovascular structures and blood loss. These therapeutic methods are
characterized by better postoperative morbidity compared with open repair, as
clearly shown in this case. We demonstrated that proper adoption of endovascular
procedures can lead to a durable repair of a brachial artery injury in young
patients. Overall complication rates in these procedures can be high<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>; therefore, long-term management
care is needed after these procedures. We expect significant improvements for the
treatment of vascular injuries as proper management and more endovascular procedures
are adopted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Injury to axillary arteries can be managed via surgery. Endovascular management may
yield some better outcomes than open repairs-operating time, local dissection, and
decreased potential of injuring other structures. In our case, a proper durable
repair of an axillary artery injury was achieved by adopting endovascular
procedures, and the stent was successfully used with normal vascularity for as long
as 6 years post-procedure.</p><table-wrap id="t1" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="5%" span="1"/><col width="95%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">AA</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Substantial contributions to the

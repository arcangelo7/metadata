Our previous data confirmed that the implantation of mixed ASCs and chondrocytes into cartilage defects induced desirable <italic>in vivo</italic> healing outcomes. However, the paracrine action of ASCs on chondrocytes needs to be further elucidated. In this study, we established a co-culture system to achieve <italic>cell-to-cell</italic> and <italic>cell-to-tissue</italic> crosstalk and explored the soluble growth factors in both ASCs and chondrocytes supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum to mimic the physiological microenvironment. In ASCs, we screened for growth factors by semi-quantitative PCR and quantitative real-time PCR and found that the expression of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2), vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGFB), hypoxia inducible factor-1&#x003b1; (HIF-1&#x003b1;), fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), and transforming growth factor-&#x003b2;1 significantly increased after co-culture in comparison with mono-culture. In chondrocytes, VEGFA was significantly enhanced after co-culture. Unexpectedly, the expression of collagen II and aggrecan was significantly down-regulated in the co-culture group compared with the mono-culture group. Meanwhile, among all the growth factors screened, we found that the BMP family members BMP-2, BMP-4, and BMP-5 were down-regulated and that VEGFB, HIF-1&#x003b1;, FGF-2, and PDGF were significantly decreased after co-culture. These results suggest that crosstalk between ASCs and chondrocytes is a pathway through the regulated growth factors that might have potential in cartilage repair and regeneration and could be useful for tissue engineering.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Cartilage is an avascular tissue and not able to heal spontaneously; thus, the nutrient supply for chondrocytes depends predominantly on synovial diffusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> Tissue engineering holds promise for the healing of damaged tissues and organs by manipulating cells, scaffolds, and stimuli in order to solve the problems resulting from severe trauma, resection of tumors, and congenital deformity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> Many approaches have been developed for cartilage regeneration, including the implantation of cells and tissues such as autologous chondrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> with or without biomaterials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> Although chondrocytes are a promising candidate for chondrogenesis and widely applied in cartilage regeneration, a limited cell number can be obtained from autologous cartilage.

For chondrocyte culturing, briefly, cartilage was minced into small pieces and pretreated with 0.25% trypsin for 30 min, and then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to eliminate the trypsin. Cartilage pieces were digested with collagenase type II (0.1%) for 2&#x02013;3 h in a 37 &#x000b0;C water bath. After centrifugation at 200<italic>g</italic> for 5 min, the mixed cartilage and chondrocytes were suspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 U&#x000b7;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> penicillin/streptomycin.

ASCs and chondrocytes were cultured in DMEM and &#x003b1;-MEM media, respectively. Once the cells were adherent to plates and equilibrated for 24 h, the culture media were replaced with 2% FBS media for a 12 h starvation. After starvation, the media were changed to fresh 1% FBS DMEM.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell proliferation and migration detection</title><p>To detect the cell proliferation and migration index in the mono- and co-culture groups, passage II ASCs and chondrocytes were seeded onto the upper or lower chambers in E-plates at 1&#x02013;5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup> cells per well.

The cells were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin for 60 min before being incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate -phalloidin at a 1:100 dilution. Then, the samples were stained with DAPI for 10 min, and images were captured by microscope.</p></sec><sec><title>Semi-quantitative PCR</title><p>RNA was collected from cultured ASCs and chondrocytes after co-culturing for 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 d using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands) with a genomic DNA eliminator. The purified RNA was dissolved in RNase-free water, then 2 &#x003bc;L of the RNA solutions were used to measure the optical density at 260 nm with a spectrophotometer. The RNA samples were treated with DNase I (Mbi, Maryland, MD, USA), and cDNA was prepared from each sample using the cDNA synthesis kit (Mbi) in a final volume of 20 &#x000b5;L. Semi-quantitative PCR was performed with a PCR kit (Mbi) in a 25 &#x000b5;L volume containing a 1 &#x000b5;L cDNA sample using a thermo-cycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The primers (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) were searched by Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (<italic>GAPDH</italic>) and beta-actin (<italic>&#x003b2;-Actin</italic>) were used as the internal control and normalized standard, respectively. In the PCR program, cDNA was denatured for 5 min at 94 &#x000b0;C, followed by 30 cycles of 15 s at 94 &#x000b0;C, 15 s at 55&#x02013;60 &#x000b0;C, and 30 s at 72 &#x000b0;C. The DNA was resolved into bands by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel in Tris/Borate/EDTA buffer, which represented the expressing dose of the soluble growth factor genes, and the bands were visualized by staining with GoldView (Heart, Shanghai, China).</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative real-time PCR</title><p>Quantitative real-time PCR was performed with the SYBR <italic>Premix Ex Taq</italic> II PCR Kit (TAKARA, Shiga, Japan) using an iCycler (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol.

The copy numbers of each gene were determined by cycle threshold (&#x025b3;CT) methods. The means of the copy numbers of GAPDH were used as internal controls to normalize the data.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All experiments were performed in triplicate and reproduced at least three separate times.

The migration and proliferation curves were obtained for the ASCs and chondrocytes after 36 h in mono- or co-culture (data not shown). At 24 h, the amount of ASCs and chondrocytes in the upper 8.0 &#x003bc;m well passing through the porous membrane was determined by DAPI nuclear staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The cell index of migration showed that the migration of ASCs or chondrocytes in the co-culture experiment was significantly decreased after 24 h, which may demonstrate crosstalk between ASCs and chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).

The expression of <italic>BMP</italic>-2 in ASCs co-cultured with chondrocytes and cartilage explants was increased 1.549-fold and 1.318-fold, respectively, while <italic>BMP</italic>-6 expression was down-regulated to 69.3% and 65.0%, respectively.

VEGFB expression significantly increased in ASCs co-cultured with chondrocytes, with changes up to 5.757-fold; meanwhile the expression decreased in ASCs co-cultured with cartilage explants (down to 60.9%) compared with that in ASCs in mono-culture. Moreover, we found that <italic>HIF</italic>-1&#x003b1; expression was significantly up-regulated in ASCs co-cultured with chondrocytes (up to 1.998-fold) and cartilage explants (up to 2.412-fold) compared with mono-cultures. After co-culturing with the chondrocytes and cartilage explants, <italic>FGF</italic>-1 expression in ASCs decreased (down to 68.9 and 56.4%, respectively).

The paracrine influence of ASCs on chondrocytes is unclear, as is how such interactions influence the resulting cartilage repair. As cartilage is an avascular tissue, the effects on ASCs and chondrocytes in co-culture circumstances supplemented with 1% FBS need further investigation.

Cell proliferation and migration and cell morphologies were influenced by the non-contact communication. Crosstalk between ASCs and chondrocytes is a path through the regulated growth factors that could be useful in cartilage repair and regeneration and could be exploited for tissue engineering. Further studies will be required to detect more key factors involved in the co-culture system.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81201211, 81471803), and the Sichuan Science and Technology Innovation Team (2014TD0001).</p></ack><notes><p>The authors declare no conflict of interests.</p></notes><ref-list><ref id="bib1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">Veronesi F, Giavaresi G, Tschon M et al. <article-title>Clinical use of bone marrow, bone marrow concentrate, and expanded bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in cartilage disease.</article-title>

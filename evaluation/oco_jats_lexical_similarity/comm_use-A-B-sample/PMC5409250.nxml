is endemic: 0.5-2% in comparison with liver (65%) and lungs (25%)<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. The diagnosis is difficult because of long latency between
infection and manifestation of disease. Hence we report a case of a young lady with
intramyocardial and pulmonary hydatid cyst, which was surgically removed.</p></sec><sec><title>CASE REPORT</title><p>A 38-year-old lady was admitted to our hospital with hemoptysis followed by chest
pain, breathlessness and lowgrade fever. There was history of rearing pet animals.
On clinical evaluation, no abnormal findings were detected. Her hematological and
biochemical parameters were within normal limits except ELISA test for
<italic>Echinococcus granulosus,</italic> which was positive.</p><p>Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed T-wave inversion in V2, V3, V4, and V6. The chest
radiography showed well defined lesion in the right lower zone of the lung with air
fluid level, and normal cardiac silhouette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure
1</xref>). Ultrasonography of the abdomen was normal. Two-dimensional
echocardiography showing a lesion measuring 2 &#x000d7; 1.8 cm cystic mass was noted
at the apex (intramyocardial). Chest high resolution computed tomography showed a
cystic lesion with air fluid level measuring 5.7&#x000d7;4.5&#x000d7;5 cm in the
subpleural region of the right lower lobe of the lung. Cardiac magnetic resonance
imaging confirmed an intramyocardial hydatid cyst at the apex of the left
ventricle.</p><p><fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>PA chest radiography view showing a well-defined lesion (arrow) in the
right lower zone of the lung with air fluid level.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-32-02-0138-g01"/></fig></p><p>Median sternotomy was done for removal of both cardiac and lung hydatid cyst.
Cystectomy was performed under aortobicaval cardiopulmonary bypass with arrested
heart. Cystic lesion of size 2x 2 cm was found to be encapsulated by a well-formed
myocardium at the apex of left ventricle. The entire pericardial cavity was covered
with mops soaked in hypertonic saline. The cystic cavity was sterilized with 5%
cetrimide and fluid was aspirated. The cyst cavity was then opened and the daughter
cyst was removed in Toto (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). The edge
of the cyst was excised and the cavity was closed with 5-0 polypropylene plegeted
continuous sutures over Teflon felt. The pulmonary hydatid cyst was removed via
right posterolateral thoracotomy with adequate precaution using scolicidal agents
around and by giving positive pressure ventilation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). Histopathological study was consistent with hydatid cyst. The
patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged on Tab Albendazole
400 mg twice a day for six months. The patient was asymptomatic in the eight-month
follow-up period after surgery.</p><p><fig id="f2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Intraoperative photograph of intramyocardial left ventricular hydatid

granulosus.</italic> The life cycle of this tapeworm involves dogs and other
canids as definitive hosts, and domestic and wild ungulates, usually sheep, as
intermediate hosts. Human beings are only incidental intermediate hosts. The
infection, often acquired in childhood during play with infected dogs, is most
common in sheep-raising areas of the world<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. Hydatid cyst of the heart is an uncommon lesion. The most
frequent locations of hydatid cysts in humans are the liver 65% and lungs 25%, with
only 0.5-2% of cases located in the heart<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. The common
location of cardiac hydatid cysts are the left ventricle (55-60%), right ventricle
(15%), interventricular septum (9%), left atrium (8%), right atrium (4%) and
interatrial septum (2%)<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>After infection, the embryo usually reaches the myocardium via the coronary
circulation from the left side of the heart. The cyst is then formed within a period
of one to five years<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. Clinical
presentation of cardiac hydatid cyst is variable; the usual manifestations reported
are dyspnea, chest pain and palpitations<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. The most dangerous and potentially lethal complication of
cysts is their intracardiac or intrapericardial rupture, which may result in
anaphylactic shock, embolization, or cardiac tamponade, acute pericarditis, and
chronic constrictive pericarditis<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. Cysts growing toward the epicardium can compress the small
coronaries, presenting with features of coronary artery disease. Involvement of
interventricular septum may lead to conduction defects.</p><p>Pulmonary hydatid disease affects the right lung in around 60% of cases, 30% exhibit
multiple pulmonary cysts, 20% bilateral cysts and 60% are located in lower
lobes<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. Pulmonary cysts
typically increase in diameter at 1-5 cm/yr. Most lung cysts are incidentally
diagnosed on chest radiographs. Occasionally, patients present with cough,
hemoptysis, or chest pain<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.
Complication of pulmonary hydatid cysts are mainly due to the release of antigenic
material and secondary immunological reactions that develop cyst rupture.</p><p>The diagnosis is difficult because of long latency between infection and
manifestation of disease. The chest radiograph may reveal cardiomegaly, and meniscus
sign for pulmonary hydatid<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. ECG
may show T-wave inversion, premature ventricular beats. Hematological profile may
reveal eosinophilia of varying degree. Serological tests are positive in only about
50% of patients and thus limited diagnostic accuracy<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Echocardiography remains the most reliable
diagnostic measure for cardiac hydatid cyst<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are
other valuable diagnostic tools.</p><p>The recommended treatment is enucleation, pericystectomy or cystectomy with
cappitonage of the cyst under cardiopulmonary bypass via median sternotomy with
topical scolicidal agents in the surrounding operative field<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. The operative management for concomitant pulmonary hydatid
cyst can be done in the same setting or different setting. In our case, it was done
in the same setting via separate right posterolateral thoracotomy.</p><p>During surgery, it is important to minimize spillage of the cystic contents in order
to prevent intraoperative dissemination and eventual recurrence. This may be
accomplished by delivery of intact cyst or by cystic fluid aspiration with use of
scolicidal agent and preoperative therapy with Albendazole. As a rule, the heart
should not be manipulated before application of cross clamp and cardiopulmonary
bypass. Prior to enucleation, a hydatid cyst is usually sterilized by instillation
of scolicidal agents such as 2% formalin, 0.5% silver nitrate solution, 20%
hypertonic saline solution, 1% iodine solution or 5% cetrimide solution. We used 5%
cetrimide for instillation and soaked mops around the cyst cavity<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. Though cardiac hydatid cysts be very uncommon, the possibility
of this disease should be kept in mind especially in endemic areas. In order to
prevent fatal cardiac complications, cardiac hydatid cyst should be removed even in
asymptomatic patients.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="10%" span="1"/><col width="90%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HSS</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Conception and study design; manuscript redaction or

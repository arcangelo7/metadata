A therapeutic intervention is yet to be found that can prevent progression to ARDS. We recently demonstrated that the interaction between podoplanin expressed on inflammatory alveolar macrophages (iAMs) and its endogenous ligand, platelet C-type lectin-like 2 (CLEC-2), protects against exaggerated lung inflammation during a mouse model of ARDS. In this study, we aim to investigate the therapeutic use of a crosslinking/activating anti-podoplanin antibody (&#x003b1;-PDPN, clone 8.1.1) during lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung inflammation in mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Intravenous administration of &#x003b1;-PDPN was performed 6&#x02009;hours after intratracheal LPS in wildtype, C57Bl/6 mice. Lung function decline was measured by pulse oximetry as well as markers of local inflammation including bronchoalveolar lavage neutrophilia and cytokine/chemokine expression. In parallel, alveolar macrophages were isolated and cultured in vitro from haematopoietic-specific podoplanin-deficient mice (Pdpn<sup>fl/fl</sup>VAV1cre<sup>+</sup>) and floxed-only controls treated with or without LPS in the presence or absence of &#x003b1;-PDPN.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Lung function decline as well as alveolar neutrophil recruitment was significantly decreased in mice treated with the crosslinking/activating &#x003b1;-PDPN in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in vitro, activation of podoplanin on iAMs regulates their secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These data confirm the importance of the CLEC-2&#x02013;podoplanin pathway during intratracheal (IT)-LPS and demonstrate the beneficial effect of targeting podoplanin during IT-LPS in mice possibly via modulation of local cytokine/chemokine expression. Moreover, these data suggest that podoplanin-targeted therapies may have a beneficial effect in patients at risk of developing ARDS.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ards</kwd><kwd>macrophage biology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Key messages</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Administration of an anti-podoplanin antibody reduces arterial oxygen decline and alveolar neutrophilia during intratracheal&#x000a0;lipopolysaccharide in mice.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Podoplanin expression on inflammatory alveolar macrophages regulates their secretion of cytokine/chemokines in vitro.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Targeting podoplanin may be beneficial in patients at risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening condition characterised by an onset of diagnosis within 7&#x02009;days of an apparent clinical insult, bilateral opacities present on chest X-ray and severity defined as &#x02018;mild&#x02019; (PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub>=200&#x02013;300), &#x02018;moderate&#x02019; (PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub>=100&#x02013;200) or &#x02018;severe&#x02019; (PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub>&#x0003c;100).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Current treatment strategies are preventative with no therapeutic intervention proven to prevent the devastating effects of ARDS.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Podoplanin is a highly glycosylated cell surface protein expressed on alveolar epithelial type I cells and kidney podocytes, and is upregulated on various immune cell populations, including macrophages, during inflammation.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Its endogenous ligand, C-type lectin-like 2 (CLEC-2), is an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif-containing cell surface receptor, predominantly expressed on platelets.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Alveolar macrophages (AMs) play important roles in ARDS, serving as innate cellular defences clearing microbes and initiating signals to recruit neutrophils and&#x000a0;in regulating resolution of the ongoing inflammatory response.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> In an unchallenged mouse, the predominant AM population can be identified as CD11c<sup>high</sup>CD11b<sup>neg/low</sup> using flow cytometry; however, during acute lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung inflammation, an inflammatory population immerges in the alveoli that is CD11c<sup>high</sup>CD11b<sup>pos</sup>.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> Our previous data suggest that podoplanin expressed only on these CD11c<sup>high</sup>CD11b<sup>pos</sup> inflammatory alveolar macrophages (iAMs) may interact with platelet-expressed CLEC-2 to regulate the local inflammatory response.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Therefore, our aim here was to investigate whether therapeutic targeting of the CLEC-2&#x02013;podoplanin pathway is beneficial during a mouse model of ARDS.</p><p>We demonstrate that administration of a crosslinking/activating anti-podoplanin antibody (&#x003b1;-PDPN)&#x000a0;in vivo, at the peak of the acute cytokine and chemokine response, significantly reduces lung function decline, with a concomitant reduction in alveolar neutrophilia during intratracheal (IT)-LPS.

One-way analysis of variance was performed with Tukey&#x02019;s multiple comparisons test. *P&#x0003c;0.05; **P&#x0003c;0.01; ***P&#x0003c;0.001.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjresp-2017-000257f03"/></fig><p>Together, these data suggest that podoplanin expressed on iAMs regulates their release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in culture.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The principal findings of this study are that (1) targeting podoplanin in vivo limits acute lung inflammation, improving animal welfare during IT-LPS, and (2) podoplanin expressed on in vitro-generated inflammatory alveolar macrophages regulates their cytokine/chemokine secretion.</p><p>Our previous work suggested that the interaction between platelet&#x02013;CLEC-2 and podoplanin expressed on iAMs limits excessive lung inflammation during IT-LPS in mice.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Specifically, the data ruled out the contribution of other lung resident podoplanin-expressing haematopoietic cells, alveolar type I cells and lymphatic cells by the use of conditional knockout mouse models in vivo. Together with the data presented here, our findings suggest that expression and/or activation of podoplanin on iAMs is required for appropriate cytokine/chemokine release from these cells, which influences neutrophil recruitment and, in turn, lung function during IT-LPS. However, there remains no direct evidence for this or for the direct platelet&#x02013;CLEC-2-mediated activation of podoplanin on iAMs. Delineating when and how this happens during IT-LPS will be the focus of future studies.</p><p>An increase in BAL neutrophilia and total protein was observed in &#x003b1;-PDPN-treated animals during IT-LPS but not lung wet:dry lung weight. This is indicative of the &#x003b1;-PDPN&#x000a0;treatment reducing lung inflammation without affecting the increase in lung permeability observed following IT-LPS. These results were similar to those observed using multiple conditional CLEC-2/podoplanin-deficient mouse strains 48&#x02009;hours after IT-LPS,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> indicative of this pathway&#x02019;s major role in protecting against excessive pulmonary inflammation rather than affecting barrier function in this model.</p><p>There are limitations to this study. First&#x000a0;is the assumption that the iAMs generated by in vitro culturing relate directly to those observed in the alveolar space in vivo following IT-LPS. Using bone marrow chimeras combined with intranasal LPS administration, the origin of iAMs has been described to be from both tissue/alveolar resident and blood precursors.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Therefore, we chose to generate iAMs directly from alveolar resident AMs as previously reported.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> However, the composition of AM subpopulations in&#x000a0;vivo is diverse and dynamic, especially during inflammation,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and thus whether the culture-generated iAMs truly represent those present during IT-LPS remains speculative. It will therefore be important in future studies to fully characterise these podoplanin-expressing iAMs beyond the parameters tested in this study and also use bloodborne AM precursors to investigate the role of&#x000a0;podoplanin on this subpopulation of cells.</p><p>Second, we observed only a reduction in podoplanin expression in <italic>Pdpn</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>VAV1cre<sup>+</sup>-derived iAMs, possibly due to the mixed progenitor population, which contributes to AMs in adult mice as previously reported.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Ideally, a complete knockout of podoplanin is required to fully assess its function; however, global deletion of podoplanin is embryonic lethal in mouse models.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Given that an approximately 50% reduction in protein expression still had a significant effect on CXCL2 and TNF&#x003b1; expression is supportive of the importance of podoplanin in this in vitro system.</p><p>Finally, we only used one in vivo model of ARDS to assess the therapeutic targeting of podoplanin. IT-LPS predominantly reproduces the acute neutrophilic inflammatory responses that occur during ARDS in patients. Other aspects such as severe endothelial and epithelial injury as well as repair with fibrosis are less apparent or absent in this model.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> It will therefore be of paramount importance to test the &#x003b1;-PDPN in other models of ARDS.</p><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates that therapeutic administration of an &#x003b1;-PDPN is beneficial during a mouse model of ARDS in vivo. This may be via activation of podoplanin expressed on iAMs, altering local cytokine/chemokine expression, which in turn regulates neutrophil recruitment. Targeting podoplanin may therefore represent a novel avenue for future therapeutics in patients at risk of developing ARDS.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr Beata Grygielska for genotyping all genetically altered mice used and Margret Goodall for production of the &#x003b1;-podoplanin antibody, clone 8.1.1, at University of Birmingham, UK.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> Conception and design: SL, JR.

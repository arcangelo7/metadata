Its role in osteoblastic differentiation and bone formation is unknown. Here we demonstrate that RANK is expressed at an early stage of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) during osteogenic differentiation in both mice and human and decreased rapidly. RANKL signaling inhibits osteogenesis by promoting &#x003b2;-catenin degradation and inhibiting its synthesis. In contrast, RANKL signaling has no significant effects on adipogenesis of BMSCs. Interestingly, conditional knockout of <italic>rank</italic> in BMSCs with <italic>Prx1</italic>-Cre mice leads to a higher bone mass and increased trabecular bone formation independent of osteoclasts. In addition, <italic>rank</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup>: <italic>Prx1</italic>-Cre mice show resistance to ovariectomy-(OVX) induced bone loss. Thus, our results reveal that RANKL signaling regulates both osteoclasts and osteoblasts by inhibition of osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs and promotion of osteoclastogenesis.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="LongSummary"><title>Developmental Genetics: A dual-use gene regulates bone formation and breakdown</title><p id="Par2">Researchers in China have shown that a gene known for breaking bones down is also involved in making new bone. Bones are constantly repaired and reshaped by cells which break down bone tissue, osteoclasts, and those which create new bone, osteoblasts. The RANKL gene is known to play an important role in osteoclast development, but Jiacan Su of the Second Military Medical University has shown that it is also important for osteoblasts. Su&#x02019;s team detected high expression of RANKL and its receptor, RANK, in bone marrow stem cells, and the levels decreased as the stem cells differentiated into osteoblasts. Artificially increasing RANK expression decreased osteoblast differentiation, while reducing its expression increased osteoblast differentiation and bone mass. By showing that RANKL regulates osteoblasts as well as osteoclasts, these findings open new avenues for understanding bones development.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science Foundation of China)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>91749204</award-id><award-id>81771491</award-id><award-id>81501052</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Xiao</given-names></name><name><surname>Su</surname><given-names>Jiacan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Postnatal skeletal growth and bone remodeling are highly coordinated processes primarily mediated by bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> Receptor activator of nuclear factor &#x003ba; B Ligand (RANKL) signaling is vital for osteoclasts proliferation and differentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> RANK knockout in mice leads to severe osteopetrosis due to the absence of mature osteoclasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> Up to now, RANKL signaling has been mostly investigated in osteoclastogenesis and its inhibitor denosumab has been introduced clinically in the treatment of osteoclasts-related diseases like osteoporosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> However, its roles in osteoblastic differentiation and postnatal bone formation have not been clarified.

We hypothesized that RANK was expressed in BMSCs. We collected bone marrow from patients undergoing fracture surgeries and isolated human BMSCs identified by CD45<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/Stro-1<sup>+</sup>/CD146<sup>+</sup>. We collected BMSCs from 6-week-old male mice identified by CD34<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/CD45<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/CD73<sup>+</sup>/CD90<sup>+</sup>/CD105<sup>+</sup> (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). After passage, BMSCs of the third generation were used. We found that both human and mouse BMSCs highly expressed RANK in the cytoplasm, as assessed by immunofluorescence (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Flow cytometric analysis showed that RANK and CD90 were co-expressed in 88.3% and 92.8% of human and mice BMSCS, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Western blot and RT-PCR confirmed the RANK expressions in human and mouse BMSCs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c, d</xref>). RANK expressions were confirmed by flow cytometry, western blotting and qPCR of positive control with osteoclasts and a negative control with RANK silenced BMSCs (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S2a-c</xref>). As BMSCs are enriched in P&#x003b1;S cells and calvarial cells are used as osteoblasts, we isolated these two cells and examined (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S3a</xref>). RANK was expressed in both cell types and decreased after osteogenic differentiation (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S3b</xref>). In vivo expression was determined by in situ immunostaining with CD90 and RANK in the secondary spongiosa of the distal femur (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>).

RANK expression in BMSCs has not been determined. In 2015, a study showed that RANK was expressed in osteosarcoma tumor cells and associated with osteoblast chemotactic migration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> Based on the above findings, we hypothesized that RANKL signaling could play an important role in bone formation regulation.</p><p id="Par21">In this study, we first isolated human and mice BMSCs and identified RANK expressions in vitro and in vivo. After the osteogenic differentiation began, the expression was rapidly downregulated. Intriguingly, RANK expression was not affected during adipogenic differentiation. Thus, we speculated that RANK functioned in regulating osteoblastic differentiation. RANKL signaling inhibited osteoblastic differentiation of BMSCs in vitro. To avoid interfering with osteoclastogenesis by general knockout, we used the conditional knockout technique to specifically knockout RANK in BMSCs. We found that RANK elimination in BMSCs significantly increased bone formation with more osteoblasts by BMSCs and adipogenesis by BMSCs was not affected. The osteoclasts seemed not being affected. Thus, the increased bone formation by loss of RANK in BMSCs is independent of osteoclastogenesis.</p><p id="Par22">As the ligand for RANK receptor, RANKL has been reported to couple bone resorption and formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> Vesicular RANK secreted from the maturing osteoclasts binds osteoblastic RANKL and promotes bone formation by triggering RANKL reverse signaling. Schena et al. reported that RANKL-deficient BMSCs displayed an osteogenic differentiation defect in vitro and in vivo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> We replicated the in vitro experiments and unexpectedly found that RANKL-deficient BMSCs showed increased osteogenic capacities and RANKL overexpression inhibited BMSCs osteogenic differentiation, which is controversial to reported study. The in vivo protocol employed is ectopic bone formation assay, which could not fully reflect the roles of RANKL-deficient BMSCs. For, an in vivo study by Jinhu Xiong et al. reported that mice with RANKL deletion in committed osteoblast progenitors with Osx1-Cre showed a normal cancellous architecture with no evidence of bone formation defect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> Generally, the roles of RANKL on BMSCs in regulating osteoblastogenesis are under debate, which needs further study.</p><p id="Par23">For molecular mechanisms, after RANKL activates RANK, several pathways, including NF-&#x003ba;B, MAPK and Akt are activated. NF-&#x003ba;B was reported to inhibit osteoblastic bone formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> We hypothesized that NF-&#x003ba;B pathway was vital.

This mixed methods study aimed to ascertain acceptability of different methods of blood pressure monitoring to people from different minority ethnic groups and to develop an understanding of the factors underpinning their preferences.</p></sec><sec><title>METHOD</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>This work formed part of the Blood Pressure in Ethnic Groups Study (BP-Eth) for which detailed methods, including for the qualitative work, have been described previously.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In brief, people of white British, South Asian, and African Caribbean ethnicities were recruited via their GP to have their blood pressure measured by different methods in 2010&#x02013;2012. It was originally intended to recruit people of white Irish ethnicity but this proved not to be possible.

This research has shown that home monitoring, and particularly ambulatory monitoring, are less likely to be completed by minority ethnic individuals, even in a research setting with multilingual facilitators. Acceptability of ambulatory monitoring as measured by questionnaire and in qualitative focus groups was lower than either home or clinic measurement. Clinicians&#x02019; decisions regarding method of blood pressure monitoring should take into account both clinical need and patient preference, particularly for those from minority ethnic populations.</p></sec></boxed-text><p>Completion rates for each method were defined using standard definitions as follows:<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>

<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;I think that the GP should be able to decide better about the medication because I think that when you are at home you are more calm and relaxed, so your blood pressure reading should be alright.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(SA, F, 1)</attrib></disp-quote></p></sec><sec><title>Increased patient involvement</title><p>Self-monitoring was considered to promote patient involvement in the management of blood pressure:

Furthermore, South Asian and African Caribbean participants found all types of monitoring significantly less acceptable than those from the white British group and this was reflected in lower completion rates, particularly for South Asian participants. Given UK and international guidelines on the use of ambulatory monitoring for the diagnosis of hypertension, a 20% difference in completion of such monitoring could have a significant impact on the quality of care across ethnic communities.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Conversely, self-monitoring proved popular with all participants. The consistency of results across quantitative and qualitative methodologies suggests that genuine differences exist in acceptability between methods and between ethnic groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>To the authors&#x02019; knowledge, this is the first study to gain detailed information on the acceptability and performance of different methods of blood pressure monitoring in a large multiethnic population. This is important because such monitoring is such a common aspect of clinical management, particularly in primary care. The results are strengthened by using a combination of methods.</p><p>Participants were recruited from one area of the UK (the West Midlands), and homogeneity within ethnic groups has been assumed. This might potentially limit generalisability in that there may be differences within the ethnic categories used in this study. However, the uniformity of responses from multiple methods by those of different ethnic groups suggests that this is unlikely to have affected the headline results.</p><p>Recruitment relied on purposive sampling of a pool of volunteers to ensure that all three minority ethnic groups were represented, as were those with and without a diagnosis of hypertension. Responders from minority ethnic groups were younger and this was taken into account in the statistical analysis.<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> More participants had a previous diagnosis of hypertension than not, although this might be expected to lead to better rather than worse acceptability given prior exposure.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with existing literature</title><p>In common with previous studies, this work has shown that ambulatory monitoring is less acceptable than other methods of blood pressure measurement.<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Compared with previous work in the UK, Greece, and in a largely white area of the US, the current study has extended these findings to African Caribbean and South Asian groups. To the authors&#x02019; knowledge, the reduced acceptability of ABPM by minority ethnic groups, and particularly South Asians, has not been reported before.</p><p>Although relative preferences for modality of blood pressure monitoring were broadly consistent between ethnic groups, South Asian and African Caribbean participants rated all modalities of blood pressure monitoring less favourably than did their white British counterparts, albeit only approaching significance for the South Asian group for ABPM. This fits with data suggesting that minority ethnic groups rate various aspects of primary care less favourably than white British groups.<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p><p>Responders considered ABPM to be acceptable when there was a clear medical need, as it resulted in improved accuracy, reinforcing findings from the US and Greece.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The most commonly reported issue with ABPM in the focus groups and questionnaire responses was disturbance of sleep, hence the use of daytime ambulatory monitoring alone might improve this.</p><p>The positive views on home monitoring expressed here reinforce similar findings from previous trials.<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> However, this method has been shown to have only moderate diagnostic agreement when tested against the reference of ABPM.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Nonetheless, longitudinal studies have shown improved prognostic power with home readings compared with clinic readings and recent Japanese guidelines have incorporated self-monitoring for both diagnosis and ongoing management.<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Implications for practice</title><p>Around 20% fewer South Asian individuals completed the minimum acceptable number of ambulatory measurements than white British people, despite a multilingual research team, availability of translated research materials, and probably longer explanations than may occur in daily practice. This seems from the focus groups to have been at least in part because of issues of embarrassment compounded by questions from extended family that may be more relevant to those from minority ethnic groups. Serious consideration as to how this problem can be addressed is needed if the benefits of accurate monitoring and, particularly, diagnosis are to be extended to all. An important issue is the current often bulky and noisy ambulatory monitoring technology. New methods of indirect blood pressure monitoring that do not require inflating cuffs are under development and may address this.<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p><p>Greater use of home monitoring in the management of hypertension seems likely to be supported by people of all ethnicities. In the meantime, clinic monitoring currently retains a significant role in the management of hypertension despite its inaccuracy.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Clinicians&#x02019; decisions regarding the method of blood pressure monitoring for an individual should take into account both clinical need and patient preference.

(BJCVS) active and up-to-date, despite the uncertainties that pervade the political,
economic, social and scientific activities in our country.</p><p>Those who did not imagine the evil influence that would be exerted by the instability
that has taken place in the public or private Universities, were wrong. The negative
impact on teaching and research, caused by a lack of resources, was enormous.</p><p>Much more serious was the impact on hospitals, medical clinics, primary healthcare
centers, Intensive Care Units (ICUs), as well as on health equipment, dependent on
federal, state, municipal or private funding, due to the widespread undercapitalization
of governments and the population, seriously damaging the patient care, and the data
generation, essential to the research.</p><p>The question that won't go away is: What does the BJCVS have to do with all this
background?</p><p>Unfortunately, we have a lot to do with it, because the manuscripts that come to us are
basically from "Stricto or Lato Sensu" postgraduate programs, related to patient care,
and to a lesser extent regarding the basic research.</p><p>In the Editorial Issue 31-1 of the BJCVS, I pointed out that we were facing a great
challenge in 2016, due to the many changes and adjustments implemented during this
period. I was concerned about the flow of manuscripts and their quality, could be enough
to celebrate the journal's 30th anniversary with dignity, getting a better Impact Factor
(IF).</p><p>In this issue we have the intelligent answer to my apprehension.</p><sec><title>BJCVS 30 YEARS</title><p>In the section BJCVS 30 YEARS, the brilliant Professor Paulo Evora gives us a lesson
on the Impact Factor (IF) and its ills.</p><p>I ask you to carefully, read the article: Brazilian Journal of Cardiovascular Surgery
30 years: Does, the Impact Factor, matter? (Page 266).</p><p>By reading this article, we can appreciate not only the author's opinion, as well as
other subject-matter experts cited by him, showing how flawed the valuation
processes are, performed by Thompson Reuters and Scimago exclusively in order to
guide the booksellers. However, it was adopted in Brazil to generate the Qualis,
which is maintained by CAPES, a methodological excrescence that harms the
publications of countries like Brazil, and also the specialties, which are unlikely
to have as many citations as a generalist journal who has a huge field of authors
and readers.</p><p>At the beginning of the article, Professor Evora expresses my hope, in the paragraph
that should always be repeated:</p><p>"Brazil is much greater than the crises it faces. It is essential to show what we are
capable of in order to stand amidst other nations". (Domingo M. Braile, 2016).</p><p>I hope this optimism becomes a reality.</p><p>In the same section, there are also two excellent articles; one of them, by the
Professor Walter J. Gomes: Thirtieth anniversary of the Brazilian Journal of
Cardiovascular Surgery. And devising the next decades (page 265)</p><p>The author presents us with a futuristic vision of hope, only seen in patriotic
leaders.</p><p>Another article that is also worth reading is: 30 Years of BJCVS (page 267)</p><p>Written by Professor Jo&#x000e3;o de Deus e Brito, who besides doing a very well
prepared historical review, shows his deep knowledge of the BJCVS, whose he has
always been a dedicated reviewer.</p><p>I thank the collaboration of these professors on my own behalf and in the name of the
whole Editorial Board and Technical Clerks, who continue the saga and the tradition
of our journal.</p></sec><sec><title>ASSOCIATE EDITORS</title><p>As I mentioned at the beginning of this Editorial, we have been working with a focus
on modifications that were suggested to improve the performance of our journal.</p><p>For now, were indicated seven Associate Editors, in the areas of coronary diseases,
valve diseases, congenital diseases, aorta diseases, advances in cardiovascular
surgery and basic research.</p><p>The choice criteria were absolutely based on meritocracy, dependent on the
performance of the Associate Editors and Reviewers over the years.</p><p>The task was made easier by the ongoing assessment performed by the journal's staff
for many years.</p><p>The selection of the Area Editors, and the areas themselves, is not finished yet, and
should be perfected throughout the time.</p></sec><sec><title>SUBMISSION SYSTEM</title><p>As almost everyone knows, we are migrating to the: submission, review, approval, or
rejection of the manuscript to ScholarOne platform, developed by Thomson Reuters and
adopted by SciELO, with FAPESP's economic support.</p><p>This platform is internationally considered ideal for the globalized journals.</p><p>The deadline for the definite migration to the new platform is scheduled to August
15th.</p><p>I hope the implantation time can be fulfilled, since all the work is being developed
with great professionalism.</p></sec><sec><title>EVENTS</title><p>Among the good news about the events, I emphasize some very important factors:</p><p>The participation of the SBCCV with a special session during the 71st Congress of the
SBC in Fortaleza, on September 23, 2016.</p><p>In the 44th Congress of SBCCV the main theme will be: High Technology: (acquiring
knowledge to employ it better), to be held in Rio de Janeiro, on April 20-22, 2017
with special participation of international speakers such as Prof. Eric J. Velazquez
(Durham, USA); Prof. Hartzell V. Schaff (Minnesota, USA); Prof. John Puskas (New
York, USA); Prof. Michael M. Madani (San Diego, USA) and Prof. Manuel Antunes
(Coimbra, Portugal).</p></sec><sec><title>ARTICLES</title><p>As you will see, we have good national and international articles in this issue, with
notable articles from China - Mild Hypothermia May Offer Some Improvement to
Patients with MODS after CPB Surgery (page 246); Fungal Endocarditis (page 252); One
from Romania - Primary Aortoduodenal Fistula: First you Should Suspect it (page
261).</p><p>With great satisfaction, we received the first article from Portugal, Endovascular
Abdominal Aneurysm Repair in Women: What are the Differences Between the Genders?
(Page 232).</p><p>I wish you all a very nice and instructive read.</p><p>I thank, as always, the essential support of the Board of Directors, Associate
Editors, Technical Staff and especially the Authors and Readers who keep the BJCVS
alive.</p><p>Warmest regards,</p></sec><sig-block><sig>Domingo M. Braile<break/> Editor-in-Chief - BJCVS</sig></sig-block></body></article>

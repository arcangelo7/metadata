The aim of this study was to define the aetiology, treatment and outcomes of foot burns, with special interest in paediatric patients, patients with diabetic disease and burns acquired at the workplace.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This is a retrospective cohort study of 82 patients who were admitted to one of the three burn centres in the Netherlands during the period 2004 to 2013. The patients had a median age of 43.5&#x000a0;years (range 0.01&#x02013;85.9), and included 14 children and 8 diabetics. Data were collected from the hospital records.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Scalding was the most common cause of the injury. Almost all patients required surgical management. It is notable that most of hospitalized patients (82&#x000a0;%) were not admitted on the day of injury. Children had a significantly shorter length of stay compared to adults (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01). The eight patients with diabetes had a significantly longer length of hospital stay, more complications and more often residual defects compared to the non-diabetic patients. In 13 patients, the injury took place at work. Half of these burns were caused by scalding, and foot burns caused by chemicals at work were rare (two patients).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Although the incidence of foot burns is low, there is a significant morbidity due to complications and long hospital stay. The following three points are suggested. Immediate referral to a burn centre is essential. It is important to educate diabetic patients on the risk of complications and adverse outcomes after burn injury. Preventative measures at the workplace are worth considering.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Although the feet involve only a small percentage of the total body surface area (3.5&#x000a0;%), they play an important role in daily life because of their motion and weight-bearing function.

After reviewing the letters, patients who had foot burns or burns on the foot and lower leg, were selected. Patients with more severe burn wounds (burn depth and % total body surface area (TBSA)) in other body regions were excluded, because in these patients the healing process was mainly determined by the burn wounds located in other body parts.</p><p>The following data were collected from the hospital records: age, gender, comorbidities, location of accident, date of burn, date of hospital admission, date of discharge, percent total body surface area burned (% TBSA burned), burn agent, depth of burn, anatomic location of the burn, complications, treatment type, take of graft, date of complete epithelialization and suspected child abuse. In the study, hospitalization was defined as admission of more than 1 day in hospital. Complete epithelialization was defined as the complete coverage of the burn wound.</p><p>The following groups were compared regarding patient characteristics, injury characteristics, complications and outcome: children (&#x0003c;18&#x000a0;years) versus adults, diabetics versus non-diabetics and groups with different locations of the accident.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Standard statistical techniques were used to analyse differences between the groups: the Mann&#x02013;Whitney test for skewed continuous variables and the chi-squared or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test for categorical variables as appropriate.

After examining these letters, 164 patients were excluded from the analyses because they did not meet the inclusion criteria.</p><p>The remaining 82 patients (14 children and 68 adults) with foot burns were seen at the burn centre during a 9-year study period, which means an average incidence of nine patients with foot burns per year.</p><p>The median and mean age (standard deviation (SD)) of the study population was, respectively, 43.5&#x000a0;years (range 0.01&#x02013;85.9) and 40&#x000a0;years (SD 21), with more male than female patients (2.3:1). Of the adult patients, 45 (66.2&#x000a0;%) were men, and from the paediatric patients, 12 (85.7&#x000a0;%) were boys.

The burn centre is one of the three burn centres in the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, patients with superficial burns frequently visit their general practitioner and get treatment at the general practice. This may explain why relatively few patients were seen in the burn centre. This may also explain the large number of patients with deep injuries and the high percentage of grafting procedure (88&#x000a0;%) in our study compared with other studies (25&#x02013;29&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>The aetiology of foot burns varies in the literature. Hemington-Gorse et al. and Zachary et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] found scalding as the most common cause of foot burns, which is comparable with our study. In children, contact burns were the most common cause of the injury in countries with a warm climate, like Australia, South Africa and Central Asia, where walking or standing barefoot on hot ground caused foot burns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Our study confirms the finding of a study in the United Kingdom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] that in countries with a temperate climate scalding is the most common cause of foot burns in children. In the paediatric group, there was one case of suspected child abuse (7%) based on the history and presentation of the patient. In this case, the in-hospital protocol was activated, but after contact with the parents of the child, the abuse was not proven nor admitted. There is no literature about foot burns due to child abuse. Ruth et al. mentioned that up to 20&#x000a0;% of all admitted paediatric burn patients were the victims of child abuse or neglect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>In our study, complications occurred in 18 (22&#x000a0;%) of the patients of whom 7 patients had more than 1 complication. Although this outcome is comparable with a British study (18&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], the most common complication was different from this study. While the most common complication was infection in our study, hypertrophic scarring was the most common complication in the British study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This difference may be caused by more conservative treatment. In the study of Hennington-Gorse et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], 75&#x000a0;% of the patients were treated with dressings whereas 87&#x000a0;% of our patients were treated with skin grafting. Zachary et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] examined only complications like hypertrophic scarring and range of motion loss which occurred, respectively, in 5 and 6&#x000a0;% in their whole study population. In our study, 3.7&#x000a0;% of the patients had hypertrophic scarring as a complication, which was subjectively determined by the doctor who saw the patient in the outpatient clinic. Foot burns are not prone to hypertrophic scarring, and our treatment with skin grafting could provoke a positive effect on hypertrophy. The increased rate of residual defects, especially in adults (33&#x000a0;%), was not a big problem because the take rate of the grafts was good in 84&#x000a0;%, and additional surgery was necessary in 9&#x000a0;% of the adult patients.</p><p>While most of the patients (83&#x000a0;%) were not admitted on the day of injury, patients who were admitted on the day of injury seemed to have fewer complications than patients who were admitted later, but the difference was not significant.</p><p>The total number of patients with foot burns includes 14 children and 68 adults. Of the adult patients, 13 (19&#x000a0;%) had acquired the injury at the workplace, and 18 (26&#x000a0;%) had comorbidity with most frequently diabetes. Comparison between our defined groups showed relevant differences. In the first place, there was significant difference in length of stay between adult and paediatric group, while there was no significant difference in burn depth. This may be the result of the presence of comorbidity in the adult group.</p><p>In the second place, there were significant differences in complications, median length of stay and rest defects between diabetic and non-diabetic patients. This is partially comparable with other studies on foot burns in diabetic patients that have reported that foot burns in patients with diabetes are deeper and associated with worse outcomes such as higher rates of infection, graft failure, more operations and longer hospital stay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>In the third place, the percentage of patients who acquired foot burns at work in our study (19&#x000a0;%) was lower compared with the study of Hemington-Gorse et al. (47&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The study of Hemington-Gorse et al. was performed in a region with a number of large chemical industrial units and many local manual workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This may explain the difference in the proportion of work-related foot burn injuries between the studies. The results of this paper may be used for preventing foot burns in high-risk groups and may be useful for the prediction of a clinical course of foot burns, which is relevant when informing patients about complications and other outcomes.</p><p>A major limitation of this study is the small study population. Also, many differences between groups were evaluated, which may have led to false-positive findings due to multiple testing. Missing data was another limitation because of the retrospective design of this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Although the incidence of foot burns is low, there is a significant morbidity due to complications and long hospital stay.

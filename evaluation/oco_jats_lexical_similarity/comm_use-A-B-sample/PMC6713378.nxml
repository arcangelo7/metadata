being used to perform operations. Robots have frequently been used for prostatectomy and
hysterectomy, whereas their application in cardiac surgery is confined to specialized,
high-volume centres<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Robotic cardiac surgery utilizes small port incisions avoiding the need for a full
sternotomy. This provides benefits in terms of less pain, less bleeding, earlier
discharge, quicker recovery, and improved cosmesis. Traditional, video-assisted, or
laparoscopic surgeries have many of these advantages, but they have technical
limitations due to the use of long-shafted instruments and the fulcrum effect.</p><p>Robotic surgery has technical advantages as it improves dexterity by allowing the
instruments to move with six degrees of freedom. Other advantages include avoidance of
tremor and ambidexterity. Additionally, the three-dimensional (3-D) high-definition
imaging greatly improves visualization. The enhanced visual feedback, through
observation of tissue displacement and deformation, substitutes for the lack of tactile
feedback<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In cardiac surgery, robotic technology has most commonly been used to perform mitral
valve surgery and coronary artery bypass surgery<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p><sec><title>ROBOTIC MITRAL SURGERY</title><p>The enhanced 3-D imaging provided by robotic surgery is especially useful in mitral
valve surgery as it provides unparalleled visualization of the valve leaflets and
the sub-valvular structures.</p><p>The first mitral valve repair performed with a robot (the Da Vinci
System<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) occurred in 1998, carried out by Carpentier, and this
system gained the Food and Drug Administration approval for mitral valve surgery in
2002<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.
Mihaljevic et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> compared the robotic mitral valve repair (n=261)
with complete sternotomy (n=114), partial sternotomy (n=170), and mini-thoracotomy
approach (n=114). There were no significant differences between the groups with
regard to postoperative mortality, pulmonary complications, neurological
complications, and renal failure rates. The incidence of atrial fibrillation and
pleural effusion was the lowest in the robotic group, which led to a significant
reduction in length of hospital stay compared to other groups<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. However, the
cardiopulmonary bypass time was significantly longer in the robotic group than in
other groups<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. This may be related to the steep learning curve
associated with robotic surgery.</p><p>In Europe, the rate of use of robotic mitral valve surgery fell for a decade due to
the advent of the port access system that allowed mitral valve repair through a
mini-thoracotomy. This technique has provided excellent results in a minimally
invasive manner; therefore, robotic technology, with its high initial cost and
maintenance, had less market share. In contrast, robotic technology for mitral valve
repair has gained more traction in the more competitive and privatized healthcare
market of the United States of America.</p></sec><sec><title>ROBOTIC CORONARY REVASCULARIZATION SURGERY</title><p>Robotic technology can be used in multiple ways for coronary revascularization. It
includes totally endoscopic coronary artery bypass (TECAB), whereby the left
internal thoracic artery (LITA) is harvested and grafted onto the left anterior
descending (LAD) artery using a robot. Alternatively, LITA can be harvested using a
robot and then a minimally invasive coronary artery bypass is performed, whereby
LITA is hand-sewn to LAD via a mini-thoracotomy. It can be performed on both the
beating heart (off-pump) and the arrested heart (on-pump).</p><p>The first robotic TECAB was performed in 1998 by Loulmet, using the Da Vinci
System<sup>&#x000ae;[</sup><sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. Since then, more than 1,000 robotic assisted bypass
surgeries have been performed. The results of 326 patients undergoing robotic TECAB
showed mortality rate of 0.6%, stroke rate of 2%, perioperative myocardial
infarction of 2.5%, and long-term freedom from major adverse cardiac events reported
as 81% in the first postoperative 5 years<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>. However, 14% of the cases had to be
converted to a larger incision, such as sternotomy or
mini-thoracotomy<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Robotic technology has the potential to provide a new standard of care for coronary
revascularization. The new treatment strategy would combine the most beneficial
aspects of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) (i.e. LITA to LAD anastomosis) and
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (stents to other coronaries), resulting in
completely minimally invasive hybrid revascularization. There is definitive evidence
that LITA to LAD anastomosis significantly improves survival compared to PCI.</p><p>PCI with drug-eluting stents is of comparable efficacy to vein grafts and is much
less invasive. Theoretically, this strategy maximizes the benefit to the patient and
minimizes the risks.</p><p>A randomized trial to compare this hybrid strategy with conventional CABG would still
be warranted as the type of coronary arteries that receive vein grafts are different
from the coronaries that are stented due to patient selection.</p></sec><sec><title>ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY</title><p>Robotic surgery has comparable outcomes to conventional surgery with regard to
mortality and major adverse events. It has benefits in terms of shorter intensive
care and length of hospital stay, lower need for blood transfusion, and decreased
pain. These benefits are also provided by minimally invasive mitral and bypass
surgeries; therefore, robotic surgery will need to compete for a growth in the
market share.</p><p>Its widespread use is currently hindered by high initial capital investment and
ongoing maintenance costs. The purchase price can exceed US$2 million with a
US$100,000 annual service contract<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. It has been criticized for its expense with an
average cost per patient up to US$45,914<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. The other major limitation in using
robots is the steep learning curve associated with it; a competent operator requires
150-250 procedures to become adept<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>However, proponents argue that the costs can be compensated by the decreased duration
of intensive care and hospital stay, with Morgan et al. suggesting that total
operational hospital costs did not significantly increase with robotic
technology<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>. Advancements in technology have the potential to
decrease the learning time required. As many of the patents of the Da Vinci
System<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> have expired, companies are producing 2<sup>nd</sup>
generation robots that may be more versatile, compact, and easier to
use<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Robotic technology offers an exciting alternative to conventional surgery with
potential for a hybrid bypass operation. It also provides a minimally invasive
option where conventional endoscopic surgery may technically be too difficult.
However, it would need to prove itself as non-inferior to conventional surgery with
regard to short- and long-term outcomes in randomized control trials. Then, it would
need to further prove itself as an economically viable option.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>JE</given-names></name><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>DC</given-names></name><name><surname>Parsons</surname><given-names>JK</given-names></name><name><surname>Talamini</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The first national examination of outcomes and trends in robotic

Rather than simply providing more evidence that tracking in any form supports behaviour change, this trial represents an important step forward in the challenging issue of physical activity promotion. The unique relationship that individuals have with their mobile devices, along with the immediacy and responsiveness they demonstrate within this relationship, suggest that longer-term motivational change may be possible.

<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;OK so once I got over the initial palpitations and had my plan, I tried to get to it and it was a focus and I found that very motivating to have that focus, that I knew now this is actually what you need to have a healthy lifestyle&#x02026; you need to have this much exercise.

Those assigned to the control group were given a physical activity goal of an additional 30 minutes&#x02019; walking per day (the equivalent of 10 000 steps), along with their normal activity but did not receive any feedback on their goal attainment.</p><p>Participants using the app reported that the instant feedback put them under pressure as they checked it often and it even caused frustration if they didn&#x02019;t reach the goal:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;Because you&#x02019;ve got the instant feedback to see how you get on, so that&#x02019;s how it was different because it had a focus. It just tuned you in and it got you into the type of the pattern and the routine of having the focus and &#x02026; well it was much easier to get into a pattern or routine with this focus and getting the feedback, and getting &#x0201c;yes I achieved a target today&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;I&#x02019;m nearly there&#x0201d;.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Participant 11)</attrib></disp-quote></p></sec><sec><title>Rewards</title><p>The extrinsic reward of visualising the step count and comparing it with the 10 000 daily-step goal yielded reports of participants feeling satisfaction and a sense of achievement at their success or, alternatively, feeling frustrated if they didn&#x02019;t reach their goal:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;It&#x02019;s a very easy concept, 10 000 steps a day. It&#x02019;s easy to remember the phone, is easy to look at your app see how many steps you&#x02019;re doing, where you are in relation to, like, the graph &#x02014; you know, whether you&#x02019;re at zero or near to the 10 000. It&#x02019;s motivating; you want to get nearer up &#x02026;you know &#x02026;to move your little point along the band to get closer to the 10 000.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Participant 4)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>Participants clearly described the motivation they experienced by using the app:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;It&#x02019;s like a &#x0201c;little boss in my pocket&#x0201d;&#x02026; that&#x02019;s sort of saying &#x0201c;you know you need to get out and do this&#x0201d;. I don&#x02019;t know how I&#x02019;d be if I turned it off. I won&#x02019;t turn it off, not for the moment anyway. I am quite happy to have it on because I am much more conscious of going out for that walk.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Participant 9)</attrib></disp-quote></p></sec><sec><title>Control and focus</title><p>Different achievement strategies demonstrated how the app indirectly encouraged participants to change their exercise behaviour. With barriers such as inclement weather or dark evenings, child minding, and restrictions due to work activities, they developed alternative methods of gaining steps, such as skipping, using a cross-trainer, and walking around the house at night in order to achieve the goal. This highlighted their focus on, and control over, how to accomplish the 10 000 daily steps by timing exercise to suit their individual daily patterns:
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;So it motivated me to find people</italic> [babysitters] <italic>just for that couple of minutes to get out and do the steps.&#x02019;</italic></p><attrib>(Participant 4)</attrib></disp-quote>
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;I tried to make sure that I reached certain little goals in the step count throughout the day. So by 10 o&#x02019;clock I was used to have been walking a kilometre or 2km into work and by 12 o&#x02019;clock I was used to having another 2000 steps done &#x02026;so I tried to set little targets throughout the day so if I was tired by evening time that I&#x02019;d still have accumulated most of the steps for the day.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Participant 8)</attrib></disp-quote></p></sec><sec><title>Confidence</title><p>Participants gained confidence by monitoring feedback on their activity. They began to determine how to plan exercise into their daily routine, such as averaging 2 days&#x02019; step count when they were not going to reach their daily target or working towards an overall weekly average:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;I wanted to get the overall figure of 10 000, irrespective of some days it would have went to 12 000 and some days it would have been 8000. But there was one particular day I was driving all day and the function I was at, there was no walking involved, and then I drove all the way back, so I said that&#x02019;s going to pull me down on my average.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Participant 10)</attrib></disp-quote></p></sec><sec><title>Ownership</title><p>Achieving 10 000 daily steps became a personal goal for participants, an achievement over which they felt ownership. They also reported that being able to use the app independently was an advantage, as was the fact that it was portable and could, therefore, be used anywhere:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;If I&#x02019;m going somewhere, number one you bring it with you, number two, you &#x0201c;park away&#x0201d; as I call it, and you walk further, no big deal.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Participant 10)</attrib></disp-quote>
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;But you have control of this yourself. And you can just do it privately and nobody need know anything about it. And you can motivate yourself with yourself and nobody else.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Participant 12)</attrib></disp-quote></p></sec></sec><sec><title>Persuasive technology tools</title><p>The second major and interrelated theme was persuasive technology tools, as these were what emerged as the underlying mechanisms of the transformation process in the first main theme. These tools have been previously described in the persuasive technology literature and include:

No searching was required unless participants wanted to tap the icon and access the graphs for comparisons with their step-count data from the previous day or week:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;It was real easy you just put it in your pocket and off you go and&#x02026; you could do it at your own pace.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Participant 5)</attrib></disp-quote></p></sec><sec><title>Tailoring</title><p>Tailoring is providing information specific to an individual in order to elicit a behaviour or attitude change.<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The step count was individual to the participant and served as a motivating factor to increase their walking exercise where possible:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;I hated going out in the dark but I have gone out as far as the road and back to get my steps and there&#x02019;s a stepper upstairs and I went on that a few times. Halfway through it, when I became more organised, I decided I know the best time for me to go do this walk is in the morning.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Participant 9)</attrib></disp-quote></p></sec><sec><title>Suggestion</title><p>Suggestion describes providing a cue to perform the behaviour at an opportune time.<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The live step-count feedback (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), which was the centrepoint of a highly visible icon on the app, made participants aware that their steps were being continually tracked, which supported a constant awareness of their goal:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;I used to make a conscious effort not to check it up &#x02019;til lunchtime because I didn&#x02019;t want to be disappointing myself because I could be standing for long periods when I was (working) and then I&#x02019;d check it at lunchtime so I&#x02019;d know in the afternoon I need to make up an extra conscious effort to whizz around the place. Certainly from lunchtime onwards I&#x02019;d probably check it more and then, last thing, when I was leaving work I&#x02019;d check it so I&#x02019;d know exactly what I&#x02019;d have to do in the evening time.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Participant 3)</attrib></disp-quote></p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold><italic>Live step-count display of the smartphone application.</italic></bold></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bjgpAug2014-64-625-e500-2"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Self-monitoring</title><p>Self-monitoring technology helps people to track their progress to change behaviour to attain a goal.<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Participants experienced various degrees of reported step-count checking behaviour, ranging from every few days, daily, a couple of times per day, and hourly to every time they looked at their phone:
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;I got the app to go out in the front</italic> [on the smartphone home screen] <italic>so every time I opened the phone I could see the step count.&#x02019;</italic></p><attrib>(Participant 5)</attrib></disp-quote></p></sec><sec><title>Conditioning</title><p>Conditioning technology uses rewards or positive reinforcements in order to change behaviour.<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The positive reinforcement of seeing feedback on their progress conditioned participants towards the achievement of their goals. Equally, when the participant viewed a low step count, this served as motivation to increase their effort:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;You&#x02019;re all day thinking well I haven&#x02019;t done my 10 000 steps, how can I get another 500 up in the next half an hour or 2 hours before I go home and have to face into coming out and doing another? It was easy to get up in the morning at 6 o&#x02019;clock that once or twice I did it, and maybe have 7000 or 8000 steps done, and you do 3000 steps throughout the day no problem.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Participant 7)</attrib></disp-quote></p></sec><sec><title>Proximity</title><p>Some participants reported that they always have their smartphone in close proximity, while others had to develop the new habit of carrying the phone on them at all times:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;Very easy because I always have my phone with me anyway.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Participant 4)</attrib></disp-quote>
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;I didn&#x02019;t carry it on me so it was just to have it on me. When I was working I&#x02019;d always leave it on the counter and when it would ring I&#x02019;d come back to it so I just had to remember to put it in my pocket.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Participant 5)</attrib></disp-quote></p></sec></sec><sec><title>Usability</title><p>As with any new technology, usability challenges did arise. Some participants required assistance with downloading and setting up the app, while others encountered problems with carrying the phone, resetting the app in the mornings, and increased battery consumption; in some cases this required recharging within a 24-hour period. From a total of 90 trial participants who consented to using SMART MOVE, six discontinued due to excess battery drainage:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;I got over some of the problems by charging it in the car but, overall, it was frustrating to try and keep it charged all the time.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Participant 10)</attrib></disp-quote>
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;It was very informative. It was worth it, but carrying the phone with me was just&#x02026; you had to get used to it.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Participant 11)</attrib></disp-quote>
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;Well the app is very straightforward anyway so the only thing I found was I did have to reset it in the mornings.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Participant 1)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>Features that supported usability were:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>the application worked autonomously in the background for most smartphone types;</p></list-item><list-item><p>simple numerical literacy required; and</p></list-item><list-item><p>large graphical display.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The importance of placing the icon on the home screen, where it could always be seen easily and not avoided, was frequently cited:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;It is set so that when you open your phone it&#x02019;s on the home screen. So you see without having to go into any app.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Participant 12)</attrib></disp-quote></p></sec><sec><title>Cascade effect</title><p>A cascade effect is defined as an unforeseen series of events that can occur due to an action (participant interaction with the app) affecting a particular environment (participants&#x02019; wider lifestyle, as well as their family, social circle, and broader community). Discussion of participants&#x02019; experiences in the trial appeared to arouse curiosity and encouraged others to become aware of, and monitor, their own physical activity levels:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;I told my family, I told the people that I was sharing a house with, and there was generally a lot of curiosity about it. I live with two other guys and one of them downloaded an app as well to start monitoring exercise.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Participant 8)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>In certain cases this went as far as leading to an increase in physical activity levels:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;You know because Dad, he&#x02019;d never exercised so he actually got very into this idea of having some regular exercise, of going for a walk because normally his knee would be quite sore. So basically he found he was feeling better, his knee with a little bit more exercise, he was feeling better and he was getting out for it and he decided he&#x02019;d take the plunge and he bought a cross-trainer.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Participant 11)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>In addition, using the app to promote physical activity raised awareness of implementing additional positive lifestyle changes for some participants:
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;I think I just said I&#x02019;d take it as, I suppose, start from day one &#x02014; try and start as you mean to go on.

Principles of persuasive technology were evident as the mechanisms that facilitated this process of behaviour change.</p><p>Evident motivational effects and checking habits that result from smartphone proximity attest to the potential of apps to support behaviour change in physical activity and other lifestyle behaviours. Not surprisingly, there were usability challenges with the technology; these included increased battery consumption and participants adjusting to always having the phone on their person.</p><p>There was also a cascade effect in participants&#x02019; wider lifestyle behaviour and among their families and communities as a result of their use of the app.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This study provides original data on patients&#x02019; views and experiences of using an innovative technology to promote physical activity in primary care and supports the results of the SMART MOVE trial.<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Other strengths of this study include the number of interviews conducted (<italic>n</italic> = 12) and the fact that participants used the app on their personal mobile phones. This was felt to be a pragmatic and &#x02018;real-life&#x02019; exploration of the use of this technology in a realistic setting, and it should improve external validity of the study data. However, only smartphone users were included in the trial and, despite rapid penetration of this technology, further work is required to widen the external validity of these findings.</p><p>Data saturation was achieved during the interview process and one-on-one interviewing allowed the participants to express their individual experience unhindered by the presence of others. Reflexivity was heightened by the multidisciplinary research team reviewing the data; however, this could also be seen as a limitation as the team may have taken a different emphasis from that of an independent observer. In addition, as participants could self-refer to the study, this could have generated a response bias. Another limitation was that only Android smartphone users were included in the trial .</p><p>However due to the novel nature of the technology, it can provide a neutral space in which a clinician and patient can discuss and negotiate a management plan around the often thorny issue of sedentary lifestyle and obesity.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with existing literature</title><p>The app evaluated in this study has some similarities to previous pedometer-based interventions that have been shown to be effective in the promotion of physical activity.<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> However, smartphone-based interventions have the immediate advantage of requiring the user to carry only their own smartphone and not an extra piece of technology. In addition, a single, small observational study reported that participants testing three different apps aimed at promoting physical activity placed importance on extra functionality, such as automatic tracking of physical activity, goal setting, and enhanced visual feedback.<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> This clearly resonates with the findings of the current study, in which these characteristics were clearly described.</p><p>Employing theories applicable to health-behaviour change can support efforts to harness technologies to promote physical activity,<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> but investigation of the interactions between users and such persuasive technologies requires much greater elucidation. This is further challenged by the rapid rate of development of these technologies, which makes it very difficult for an emerging evidence base to keep pace. Larger longitudinal studies with different groups of participants would allow further exploration of the long-term effectiveness of this intervention and whether the use of this technology, like many other interventions, would wane with time.<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> However, due to the continuous and ongoing relationship individuals have with their mobile phones, this is perhaps less likely to occur than with other technologies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Implications for practice</title><p>Offering exercise advice is recommended as part of routine primary care<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and such brief interventions have been shown to be effective in producing moderate increases in physical activity.<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The app evaluated here could therefore, be included in a menu of options provided by primary care health professionals for patients considering behaviour change in relation to physical activity.</p><p>Accupedo-Pro Pedometer is readily available for purchase on the open market and a version with reduced capability is available free of charge. However, health professionals may require some familiarity with smartphone apps to assist those who are considering such an intervention.

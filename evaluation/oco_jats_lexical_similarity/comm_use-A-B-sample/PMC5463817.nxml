This year&#x02019;s global road safety week campaign from 8&#x02013;14 May highlighted measures to reduce the speed of road vehicles to prevent crashes and save lives. The campaign was first launched by the United Nations Road Safety Collaboration four years ago. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/roadsafety/week/2017">http://www.who.int/roadsafety/week/2017</ext-link></p><fig id="Fa" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><graphic xlink:href="BLT.17.010617-Fa"/><attrib>WHO/ /Andy Craggs</attrib></fig></boxed-text><sec><title>Call for action on diphtheria</title><p>Supplies of diphtheria antitoxin are urgently needed worldwide for people with confirmed or suspected diphtheria disease to improve their chances of survival, according to a World Health Organization (WHO) expert group.</p><p>The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization, which met at the end of April, called on WHO to collaborate with its partners to establish and manage a global procurement mechanism and a physical or virtual stockpile of diphtheria antitoxin.</p><p>Diphtheria is a forgotten disease in much of the world and needs global attention, the expert group said.</p><p>Progress in reducing the number of new cases of diphtheria has stalled in the last 5 years, with approximately 5000 cases reported a year, the group noted, citing data collected by WHO and the United Nations Children&#x02019;s Fund.</p><p>Most diphtheria cases occur in people who have not been vaccinated at all or in those who have not had a full course of primary vaccination and booster doses, the group said.</p><p>In humans, diphtheria can cause a severe infection of the throat that can lead to respiratory failure and death. The first line of defence against diphtheria is vaccination. Suspected and confirmed cases should be treated with diphtheria antitoxin, a medicine that is included on the WHO <italic>Model list of essential Medicines</italic>.</p><p>The expert group also called for regulatory pathways to ensure the rapid deployment of diphtheria antitoxin.</p><p>Members of the group highlighted the need for strengthening surveillance systems to detect and investigate diphtheria cases. Better data is needed to inform vaccination schedules, prevent outbreaks and to enable a prompt response to outbreaks when they occur.

It contains global and regional estimates on viral hepatitis for 2015 that will serve as the baseline for tracking progress on the <italic>Global health sector strategy on viral hepatitis 2016&#x02013;2021</italic>.</p><p>The strategy calls for the elimination of viral hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030 by reducing new infections by 90% and deaths by 65%.</p><p>The report focuses on hepatitis B and C, which are responsible for 96% of all hepatitis deaths. It presents data on new infections and deaths caused by these hepatitis viruses, and the coverage of key interventions in 2015.</p><p>About 325 million people worldwide are infected with hepatitis B or C virus. Each year, 1.75 million people become infected with hepatitis C virus.</p><p>An estimated 1.34 million deaths were caused by viral hepatitis in 2015 and data from 2000 to 2015 show that these deaths have been increasing.</p><p>The report provides guidance on how to reverse this trend by scaling up interventions.</p><p>In 2015, global coverage with the three doses of hepatitis B vaccine in infancy reached 84%. These immunizations have substantially reduced hepatitis B transmission in the first 5 years of life, as reflected by the reduction in hepatitis B prevalence among children from 4.7% in the pre-vaccine era to 1.3% in 2015.</p><p>Access to affordable testing and treatment remains limited.</p><p>Only 9% of people infected with hepatitis B (22/257 million) and 20% of people infected with hepatitis C (14/71 million) have been diagnosed. While the cumulative number of persons treated for hepatitis C reached 5.5 million in 2015, only about 500 000 had received the newer, more effective and better-tolerated class of drugs called direct-acting antivirals.</p><p>In 2015 the United Nations General Assembly adopted the <italic>2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development </italic>calling on the international community to combat hepatitis, and in 2016 the World Health Assembly adopted the strategy on viral hepatitis with elimination as its overarching vision.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/hepatitis/publications/global-hepatitis-report2017">http://www.who.int/hepatitis/publications/global-hepatitis-report2017</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>Mexico eliminates trachoma</title><p>Mexico has become the third country &#x02013; after Morocco and Oman &#x02013; to receive WHO validation for the elimination of trachoma as a public health problem.</p><p>Trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide. It is caused by the <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> bacterium and is transmitted by direct contact and flies.</p><p>The disease affects poor, isolated populations in 41 countries and had been endemic in the Mexican state of Chiapas.</p><p>In 2004, the Chiapas state health ministry launched the Trachoma Prevention and Control Programme and stepped up the delivery of a comprehensive package of WHO-recommended interventions, including surgery for advanced disease, antibiotics to clear <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> infection, facial cleanliness and environmental measures to reduce transmission.</p><p>In addition, the Trachoma Brigades &#x02013; a group of health workers trained to combat trachoma &#x02013; worked to reduce the number of cases from 1794 in 2004 to zero cases in 2016, according to data from the Chiapas Trachoma Prevention and Control Programme.</p><p>Thus, Mexico met the international criteria for elimination of trachoma as a public health problem: prevalence of less than 5% in children of 1 to 9 years of age, and less than one case of trachomatous trichiasis (inverted eyelashes) per 1000 inhabitants.</p><p>In 2012, there were only 36 cases of infection among children from 1 to 9 years of age (less than 5%) and less than 1 case of trachomatous trichiasis per 1000 inhabitants.</p><p>Mexico&#x02019;s Secretary of Health, Jose Narro Robles, said that the achievement was due to &#x0201c;a long history of hard work and efforts by many persons, over the course of generations&#x0201d;.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/blindness/causes/WHA51.11">http://www.who.int/blindness/causes/WHA51.11</ext-link></p><boxed-text id="Bb" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Cover photo </title></caption><p>A child is vaccinated against yellow fever in the Angolan city of Chitato during the 2016 yellow fever outbreak.

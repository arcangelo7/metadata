To address the shortcomings associated with the use of primary MSCs, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived MSCs (iMSCs) have been proposed as an alternative. The aim of this study was to investigate the bone regeneration potential of human iMSCs combined with calcium phosphate granules (CPG) in critical-size defects in the proximal tibias of mini-pigs in the early phase of bone healing compared to that of a previously reported autograft treatment and treatment with a composite made of either a combination of autologous BMC and CPG or CPG alone. iMSCs were derived from iPSCs originating from human fetal foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs). They were able to differentiate into osteoblasts in vitro, express a plethora of bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) and secrete paracrine signaling-associated cytokines such as PDGF-AA and osteopontin. Radiologically and histomorphometrically, HFF-iMSC&#x02009;+&#x02009;CPG transplantation resulted in significantly better osseous consolidation than the transplantation of CPG alone and produced no significantly different outcomes compared to the transplantation of autologous BMC&#x02009;+&#x02009;CPG after 6 weeks. The results of this translational study imply that iMSCs represent a valuable future treatment option for load-bearing bone defects in humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Bone</kwd><kwd>Bone quality and biomechanics</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001654</institution-id><institution>German Academic Exchange Service | German Academic Exchange Service London (Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst London)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DAAD-91607303</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Adjaye</surname><given-names>James</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100003484</institution-id><institution>Heinrich-Heine-Universit&#x000e4;t D&#x000fc;sseldorf (Heinrich Heine University D&#x000fc;sseldorf)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001655</institution-id><institution>Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (German Academic Exchange Service)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DAAD-91607303</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rahman</surname><given-names>Md Shaifur</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The majority of bone fractures heal without complications.

The advantage of the use of iMSCs is that they can be generated from well-characterized and banked iPSCs with known HLA types. Another advantage of iMSCs over their native counterparts is that iMSCs have been characterized as rejuvenated MSCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> Although they are derived from pluripotent cells (which are by definition tumorigenic), iMSCs themselves are free from the risk of tumor formation since they do not express oncogenic pluripotency-associated genes such as OCT4.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> Moreover, iMSCs outperformed native MSCs in the treatment of multiple sclerosis in a rodent model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> More importantly, iMSCs have been successfully used in vivo to improve bone regeneration by their direct differentiation into bone cells and their recruitment of host cells in a radial defect model in mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and impact of the use of a composite made of human iMSCs and calcium phosphate granules (CPG) for bone regeneration compared with that of a previously investigated autograft treatment, a composite made of autologous BMCs and CPG, and CPG alone in a critical-size long bone defect in mini-pigs under weight-bearing conditions in the early phase of bone healing.

Radiologically and histomorphometrically, the transplantation of the HFF-iMSCs loaded on CPG led to significantly better osseous consolidation in the central and cortical defect zones compared to that obtained with the use of CPG alone. Furthermore, in comparison with the composite of autologous BMC&#x02009;+&#x02009;CPG, no significant differences could be found in the cortical and central defect areas.

As expected, both radiologically and histomorphometrically, autologous bone transplantation resulted in the highest rate of new bone formation, which was significantly higher compared to that observed in all other groups.

The successful outcome of the transplantation of the composite of HFF-iMSCs and micro- and macroporous calcium phosphate granules (CPG) may have been due to the characteristics of the specific scaffold material used. An in vitro compatibility test of HFF-iMSCs and CPG (see Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>) showed that HFF-iMSCs can be absorbed by CPG and remain alive and functional within the scaffold material.

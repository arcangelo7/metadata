Participants had the following types of tendinopathy: shoulder in seven studies, lateral elbow in three, patellar in one and Achilles in one.

</p><p>As the research on the management of tendinopathy is constantly increasing, new treatment modalities continuously emerge making decisions difficult for the treating healthcare professionals.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In the absence of complete tendon tears, loading remains the mainstay of treatment and it is recommended as first line for all tendinopathies for 6 months.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> The choice of second-line treatment, which ranges from non-invasive modalities such as extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT), glyceryl trinitrate patches<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and injection therapies to invasive surgery remains controversial.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref>

</p><p>The aim of this systematic review was to consider evidence that derives from studies assessing the effectiveness of surgery for tendinopathy in the general population. This includes comparisons of surgery (open or arthroscopic) with either non-surgical treatment modalities, sham surgery or no treatment in all tendinopathies with respect to the following outcome measures: pain, function, range of movement (ROM), force/strength, patient satisfaction, treatment success, quality of life (QoL) and complications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The present systematic review has been conducted and authored according to the <bold>&#x02018;</bold>Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses&#x02019;<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> (PRISMA) guidelines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>PRISMA flow diagram of included studies.

</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Quality assessment</title><p>For a thorough assessment of the studies, internal validity (freedom from bias), external validity (generalisability/applicability) and precision (reproducibility/freedom from random error) were all assessed separately by two of the authors (DC and CC) independently and a third independent opinion (PK) was sought where disagreements existed. Quality scales and resulting scores were not used as these usually combine aspects of study methodology with aspects of reporting; therefore, they are thought to be inappropriate for assessment of study quality.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In addition, score cut-offs classifying studies of good or poor quality are usually not provided and consequently these are usually made up by the author of the review article which can be highly variable.</p><p>For internal validity, the &#x02018;Cochrane Collaboration&#x02019;s tool for assessing risk of bias in randomised trials&#x02019; was used, which includes six questions/criteria assessing the risk of five specific and one non-specific (&#x02018;other&#x02019;) types of bias.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> As &#x02018;other&#x02019; bias, our preset assessment criteria were as follows: (a) adequate and appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria, (b) differences between treatment and control groups at baseline (confounding) and (c) appropriateness of statistical tests deployed. External validity was assessed based on the population, age range and clinical relevance of interventions and outcome measures. For the assessment of precision, the sample size, performance of statistical power calculation and p values that were used to define statistical significance were taken into account.</p><p>In the Cochrane Collaboration&#x02019;s tool, each item is classified as &#x02018;high&#x02019;, &#x02018;low&#x02019; or &#x02018;unclear&#x02019; risk of bias. No total scores are given. External validity and precision of each study were rated separately as of &#x02018;high&#x02019;, &#x02018;low&#x02019; or &#x02018;unclear&#x02019; risk.</p><p>Overall, studies were characterised as of &#x02018;good&#x02019;, &#x02018;moderate&#x02019; or &#x02018;poor&#x02019; quality based on a combined assessment of their internal validity, external validity and precision which was again conducted by two of the authors independently (DC and CC) and the opinion of a third author was provided where the two judgements differed. The criteria used for overall quality assessment were as follows: &#x02018;Good&#x02019;-quality studies had &#x02018;high&#x02019; risk of bias in &#x0003c;2 of the internal validity categories, external validity and precision; &#x02018;Moderate&#x02019;-quality studies had &#x02018;high&#x02019; risk bias in two of the internal validity categories, external validity and precision; &#x02018;Poor&#x02019;-quality studies had &#x02018;high&#x02019; risk of bias in &#x0003e;2 of the internal validity categories, external validity and precision.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Data extraction: handling</title><p>Each of the eligible articles was initially read by the first author to gain familiarity and subsequently each article was re-read and their key characteristics were extracted and inserted in tables in Microsoft Word to facilitate analysis and presentation.</p><p>For the presentation of results, outcomes were divided into midterm (up to 1-year follow-up) and long term (more than 1-year follow-up). Where results were reported at more than one time points in the midterm and in the long term, the longest-term results were used for each study in the results tables; however, findings at all follow-up stages are described in text in the results section. Where studies used tools and questionnaires as part of outcome measures, their results were tabulated under the generic outcome category according to the aim of the questionnaire. Where results of their specific subcomponents were presented too, additional results were tabulated under the corresponding outcome category: for example, where the Oxford Shoulder Score was used, the aim of which is functional assessment, results of the overall score were used for &#x02018;function&#x02019;; if the findings of specific questions of the questionnaires that are related to &#x02018;pain&#x02019; were also described, this specific result was also used for &#x02018;pain&#x02019;, etc. The outcome category &#x02018;complications&#x02019; included all generic and surgery-specific intraoperative and postoperative complications as well as progression of disease to full tendon tears and other debilitating conditions (eg, adhesive capsulitis).</p><p>To classify the strength of evidence for each outcome reported, we used the rating system formulated by Van Tulder <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> which consists of four levels of evidence: strong evidence (Level 1) is provided by generally consistent findings in multiple high-quality randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Moderate evidence (Level 2) is provided by generally consistent findings in one high-quality RCT and one or more low-quality RCTs, or by generally consistent findings in multiple low-quality RCTs. Limited or conflicting evidence (Level 3) is provided by only 1 RCT (either high or low quality), or by inconsistent findings in multiple RCTs. No evidence (Level 4) is defined by the absence of RCTs.</p><p>As our overall quality assessment included a &#x02018;moderate&#x02019;-quality category, we extended Level 2 to &#x02018;evidence provided by generally consistent findings in high-quality RCT and one or more low-quality or moderate-quality RCTs or multiple-moderate-quality RCTs&#x02019;. Two of the authors (DC and CC) jointly decided on the level of evidence for each outcome based on the aforementioned system without any disagreements. Results were considered to be significant when they were based on either strong or moderate evidence.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Definitions and acronyms</title><p>Physiotherapy (any tendon rehabilitation regime administered regularly aiming to strengthen the affected tendon includes &#x02018;supervised exercises&#x02019; and &#x02018;eccentric training&#x02019;; does NOT include standard postoperative rehabilitation); sham surgery (a faked surgical intervention that omits the step thought to be therapeutically necessary); ORI-TETS (the Orthopaedic Research Institute Tennis Elbow Testing System); OSS (Oxford Shoulder Score); SDQ (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire); HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score); VAS (Visual Analogue Scale); EQ VAS (EuroQoL VAS); EQ-5D-3L (EuroQoL 5 Dimensions 3 Level index); PRIM (Project on Research and Intervention in Monotonous work); QoL (Quality of Life); UCLA (University of California Los Angeles score); VISA (Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment); ROM: range of movement; 15D (15-dimensional).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 12 eligible studies were identified with a total of n=1051 participants (mean 87.4&#x000b1;80.9) with n=1056 affected tendons (five bilateral); of these, n=459 tendons had surgery, n=258 tendons received non-surgical treatments (n=178 physiotherapy, n=50 ESWT, n=30 placebo laser, n=20 botox, n=10 polidocanol), n=116 had sham surgery (placebo), n=30 had detuned laser (placebo) and n=104 had observation only (no treatment).

Of the tendons treated surgically (including sham surgery), n=177 operations were performed open and n=398 arthroscopically. Surgery in those with lateral elbow tendinopathy, Achilles and patellar tendinopathy was open in all cases while that for shoulder tendinopathy was either open (n=45) or arthroscopic (n=398). A total of eight studies were controlled as at least one of their treatment groups received either placebo (detuned laser or sham surgery) or an exercise regime which has repeatedly been proven to be effective and is currently recommended as first-line treatment for all tendinopathies. Mean age was 48.0 years (range 18&#x02013;72). All studies included patients with chronic tendinopathy (duration of symptoms &#x0003e;3 months).

Brox <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> were the first to compare surgery and any mode of conservative management with a randomised study in patients with shoulder tendinopathy. Comparing arthroscopic surgery and physiotherapy, there was a statistically insignificant difference in the Neer score improvement and pain reduction from moderate to mild favouring the surgical group. The latter outcome measure was found to be statistically significant when the comparisons were adjusted for sex (fewer females in the surgical group at baseline) in favour of the surgical group. At 2.5-year follow-up, success rates (defined as Neer score &#x0003e;80) were similar between those who received exercises only and those who received surgery.</p><p>In a similar study in patients with shoulder tendinopathy, Haahr <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> reported no differences in Constant score (primary outcome) and its sub-scores (pain, function, ROM, force) between their two groups over 1 year. Differences in the secondary outcomes (pain and dysfunction) were also non-significant at 1-year follow-up. Six of the patients in the physiotherapy group (14%) ended up having an operation within the 12 months; comparisons at 12 months were performed as per &#x02018;intention-to-treat&#x02019; which may have resulted in results being biassed in favour of the physiotherapy group. The same group<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> later found no significant differences between the two groups in terms of income transfers, obtaining a disability pension 4 years after inclusion and self-reported outcomes as measured by the PRIM score 4&#x02013;8 years after inclusion.</p><p>Rahme <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> in their study of shoulder tendinopathy, investigated surgical patients receiving postoperative physiotherapy, the nature or further details of which are not reported; therefore, we do not consider this as combined treatment. Even though the emphasis of the study was on predictive factors and pain-generating mechanisms, at 6-month follow-up there was no difference in the two groups with regard to the proportion who had achieved at least 50% reduction of the initial total pain score. After the 6-month time point, more than half of the physiotherapy group were given the opportunity and elected to have surgery and results at 12-month follow-up are presented on an &#x02018;as treated&#x02019; and not on an &#x02018;intention-to-treat&#x02019; basis.</p><p>In their study, Ketola <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> found no differences between patients with shoulder tendinopathy receiving physiotherapy versus those receiving physiotherapy plus surgery in the primary (self-rated pain) or secondary (disability, night pain, SDQ score, number of painful days, proportion of pain-free patients) outcomes at 2- and 5-year follow-up.

All three groups improved significantly in terms of internal rotation at follow-up versus baseline with no significant difference between groups. The Constant score improved at statistical significance from baseline to follow-up in the two surgical groups but not in the physiotherapy group; however, no significant intergroup differences were observed. Active elevation strength only improved significantly in the open surgery group at follow-up compared with baseline but, similarly, the three groups were statistically similar at follow-up. The same group reported results of the same patients at &#x0003e;10-year follow-up which favour surgery over physiotherapy. The surgical groups demonstrated significantly improved active elevation ROM compared with the physiotherapy group, internal rotation improved within all groups from baseline to follow-up but not between groups and muscle strength only improved significantly at follow-up within the open surgery group without intergroup differences.</p><p>In the study by Bahr <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> in patellar tendinopathy, VISA score improved significantly in both groups with time; however, there was no statistically significant differences between the groups at any stage of follow-up.

An interesting finding of our review is that surgery appeared to be superior to no treatment or placebo but not to sham surgery. While the placebo group that received detuned laser in the study by Brox <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> exhibited no improvement in the Neer shoulder score at 6-months follow-up, the group of patients that received no treatment in the study by Beard <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> had a higher OSS at both 6 and 12 months compared with baseline.</p><p>This discrepancy may be a result of different outcome measures and/or sample sizes in the two studies or other methodological differences. Regardless of this discrepancy, surgery was significantly more effective than detuned laser and no treatment in the two studies but not to sham surgery in the latter study. This is in accordance with the findings of Kroslak &#x00026; Murrell<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> who found no differences in outcomes with the Nirschl procedure versus sham surgery in patients with lateral elbow tendinopathy. According to Beard <italic>et al,</italic><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> the difference between surgery and no treatment, taking into account the similar effects of arthroscopic decompression and sham arthroscopy, may be attributable to surgical placebo effect, unidentified effects of arthroscopic assessment of the joint and bursa, and rest and postoperative physiotherapy associated with surgery. Based on their findings, the authors state that arthroscopy (with or without decompression) could be used for the treatment of shoulder tendinopathy but at the same time they suggest assessing other management strategies apart from surgery.</p><p>Sham surgery in randomised controlled surgical trials is gaining increasing popularity despite ethical considerations and studies with sham surgery in orthopaedics have reported interesting results.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 39</xref> Compared with using a non-surgical control group, sham surgery equalises the placebo effect of surgery and can give more realistic insights into the effectiveness of the actual surgical procedure in question.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> In their recent systematic review of sham surgery in orthopaedics, Louw <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> included six studies comparing orthopaedic procedures with sham surgery, one of which was the study by Kroslak &#x00026; Murrell<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> included in the present review. The authors concluded that sham surgery appears to be as effective as corrective surgery in terms of pain and disability for certain conditions; however, the results are not necessarily generalisable to operations not included in the review. This is in accordance to our study, which additionally showed similar outcomes of sham and corrective surgery in function and ROM in shoulder tendinopathy and lateral elbow tendinopathy. The exact mechanisms of surgery (corrective or sham) leading to improvement of outcomes in tendinopathy remain uncertain and the possibility of this improvement being due to the postoperative tendon rehabilitation cannot be ignored.</p><p>Despite the rigour of our review with respect to identifying all the available evidence and the quality assessment of the included studies, we recognise study limitations. First, due to the small number of eligible studies and the different comparisons of surgery with each non-surgical treatment modality, our conclusions on most outcomes had a poor level of evidence. Equally, due to the lack of adequate data, different tendinopathies were clustered together in some comparisons (surgery vs sham surgery; surgery vs ESWT; surgery vs physiotherapy) to increase the strength of evidence. Although we acknowledge this as a potential drawback of our study, we expect specific treatments may potentially yield to similar (if not identical) effects on tendinopathies at different sites as they share the same pathophysiology. However, we did not generalise conclusions on comparisons of modalities to include types of tendinopathy that did not contribute any results for that specific comparison. Additionally, the wide range of outcome measures used by authors resulted in lack of homogeneity which made the conduction of a meta-analysis impossible. The different regimes and intensities of physiotherapy and postoperative rehabilitation used in studies might have affected the results and, in patients treated surgically, the possibility of improvement due to the postoperative rehabilitation/physiotherapy cannot be overlooked. Due to the small patient numbers in many of the studies, our inability to calculate a minimal clinically important difference may mask the fact that statistically significant differences differ from ultimate meaningful benefit to these patients with tendinopathy. Finally, as the duration of symptoms of tendinopathy in some studies<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27 29 36</xref> was only 3 months, natural progression of the disease may have improved patient outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this systematic review of 12 eligible RCTs in patients with various tendinopathies, surgery was not superior to sham surgery in patients with tendinopathy in the midterm and long term. Further well-designed randomised studies with large populations comparing surgery with both tendon loading regimes and sham surgery are warranted. In the meantime, we advocate that healthcare professionals who treat patients with tendinopathies should reserve surgery for selected cases and only after a sufficiently long course (12 months) of evidence-based loading exercise has failed.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> NLM and DC conceived and designed the study.

al.<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>
published a paper entitled "Lidocaine and pinacidil added to blood
<italic>versus</italic> crystalloid cardioplegic solutions: study in isolated
hearts". The authors report on studies in rat hearts using a Langendorff model. Besides
a control group, two other groups were investigated: Custodiol HTK solution and Del Nido
solution. Pinacidil was added to both solutions, while lidocaine was only added to
Custodiol, since Lidocaine is already an essential compound of Del Nido solution. After
180-min-ischemia at 4&#x000ba;C all hearts were aerobically reperfused for 90 mins and the
following parameters were analyzed (unfortunately only as percentage of recovery):
contractility, coronary resistance and alpha-fodrin degeneration.</p><p>The authors reported on superior outcome by Del Nido solution after
90-min-reperfusion.</p><p>Although the study shows some interesting approaches to intraoperative myocardial
protection, some aspects are objectionable regarding their comparative analytical
methodology.</p><p>First, only one compound - pinacidil - was added to Del Nido solution, while two,
pinacidil and lidocaine, were added to custodiol, since lidocaine is already an
essential component of Del Nido solution. This is not consistent with a clean,
scientifically acceptable comparative analysis, as Del Nido already meets one of the
parameters subject to the investigation.</p><p>Second, to measure myocardial contractility, mostly dP/dt max. is used in appropriate
experimental or clinical investigations. However, from scientific point of view this is
not completely accurate, since the time until the maximal pressure is reached, may play
an important role. Therefore, it would be correct to additionally divide dP/dt by t
(time).</p><p>Third, Custodiol is the only highly buffered cardioplegic solution available worldwide.
The efficacy of buffers in any cardioplegic solution can be clearly demonstrated by
simultaneous measurements of extracellular myocardial pH and of myocardial lactate
content during ischemia<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Lactate/pH relationships differ depending on the
cardioplegic solutions applied and concerning a buffered solution, the lactate/pH
relationship depends on the nature of the buffer applied, on buffer concentration and,
on additional compounds in a cardioplegic solution<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. Any drug that stabilizes myocardial
membranes, will impair the permeation of H<sup>+</sup>-ions from the intra- to the
extracellular space. Such impaired permeation leads to an intracellular 'overload' of
H<sup>+</sup>-ions and, conversely, to less acidification of the myocardial
extracellular space. Consequently, the lactate/pH curve will shift towards alkalosis!
This effect should occur if procaine or lidocaine are parts of the solution, since both
drugs are membrane stabilizing drugs. In experiments on ischemic hearts of mongrel dogs
at 15&#x000ba;C we compared histidine buffered solutions with and without procaine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). In this experiment we were able to
demonstrate the aforementioned effect on the extracellular pH. Although both solutions
contained equal buffer capacities, the extracellular pH is more alkalotic in the
procaine group. This means that the total available extracellular buffering capacity is
not effectively utilized, <italic>i.e</italic>. one of the principal benefits of the
solution - its buffering capacity - is not sufficiently realized<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. Therefore, it is not
surprising that the custodiol-LP group led to inferior results.</p><p>
<fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Experiments were performed on ischemic mongrel dog hearts at 15&#x000ba;C. For
myocardial protection Custodiol solution with or without procaine was used.

</p><p>The results of the current study differ from an experimental study in South Korea in 2003
which was also performed on rat hearts (!) being protected either by original custodiol
or by Del Nido solution. It became obvious that after two-hour-arrest mitochondrial
scoring was superior in the custodiol group<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Given the aforementioned objections, we would question the conclusions drawn by the
authors. They would have been correct, had they concluded that a decisively modified (!)
Custodiol solution - mainly by lidocaine - causes inferior efficacy in myocardial
protection due to the relatively reduced buffering power. But their study does not
address the intraoperative protective efficacy of the original version of custodiol and
therefore, the results are not applicable to clinical usage. In conclusion, this paper
does not represent a valid comparative study between custodiol and Del Nido
solutions.</p></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Carmo</surname><given-names>HP</given-names></name><name><surname>Reichert</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Carvalho</surname><given-names>DD</given-names></name><name><surname>Silveira-Filho</surname><given-names>LM</given-names></name><name><surname>Vilarinho</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Oliveira</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Lidocaine and pinacidil added to blood versus crystalloid

To correctly perform the statistical analysis of quantitative data, two key points should be considered. One is to identify the type of experimental design correctly, and the other is to check whether data meets the preconditions of parameter test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Otherwise, it may cause different misuse in some situations and may even draw different or opposite conclusions about the same data.</p><p id="Par4">As one of the most commonly used statistical methods in medical research papers, <italic>t-</italic>test can be divided into one-sample <italic>t-</italic>test and two-sample <italic>t-</italic>test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Thus, it is inappropriate to compare the means among multiple groups (more than three). Concretely, one-sample <italic>t-</italic>test is used to compare one group&#x02019;s average value to a single number (a known population mean, for example, the norm). The two-sample <italic>t</italic>test is a type of inferential statistic used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups. Furthermore, there are two types of two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. One is independent sample <italic>t-</italic>test (group <italic>t-</italic>test), which is performed when the samples typically consist of independent population. The other is paired (or correlated) sample <italic>t-</italic>test, which is used when each observation in one group is paired with a related observation in the other group, i.e., the samples typically consist of matched pairs of similar units, or when there are cases of repeated measures.</p><p id="Par5">Note that <italic>t-</italic>test belongs to the category of parametric test. The assumptions of the parametric test, including independence, normality, and homogeneity of variance, must be met to ensure the correct use of <italic>t-</italic>test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In addition, according to the theoretical deduction of <italic>t-</italic>test, it can only be applied to the quantitative data of single factor design, so it is inappropriate to perform <italic>t-</italic>test for multifactor design. For example, there are multiple independent variables/factors (such as gender and different types and dosage of drugs) and the comparisons among groups after controlling for simple effects of each independent variable.</p><p id="Par6">As a journal editor and reviewer, we often encounter that some authors blindly use <italic>t-</italic>test to process quantitative data without analyzing the prerequisites of <italic>t-</italic>test or considering the type of experimental design, especially to independent sample <italic>t-</italic>test (group <italic>t-</italic>test). In order to improve the quality of statistical analysis in medical research papers, according to the problems found in the process of reviewing manuscripts, we summarized the following five most common misuses of <italic>t-</italic>test and analyzed them with examples. We hope that it can provide real help to improve our data analysis ability.</p><p id="Par7">It is particularly noted that all the examples herein are artificially constructed for the purpose of illustration and do not represent actual clinical design and data.

However, there is a common and concise method to judge whether the data obey normal distribution, that is, to compare the mean and corresponding standard deviation (SD) of the data. If the mean is much smaller than its standard deviation, then the data may not obey the normal distribution, so <italic>t-</italic>test may also be inappropriate. In this case, it is better to perform <italic>t-</italic>test after an appropriate variable transformation (such as logarithm transforms and rank transforms) or perform nonparametric test method for original data.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Example 1</title><p id="Par9">A researcher adopts the independent sample <italic>t-</italic>test to compare the demographic data (age) between the experimental group and the control group.

In fact, the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum <italic>W</italic> test is a simpler and more suitable statistical method, and the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test method should be selected in this case.

By the way, when a variable does not obey the normal distribution, it is better to report as median with its corresponding first and third quartiles (Q1&#x02013;Q3) or median with its range, not as mean and standard deviation.

In a factorial design, there are two or more factors with multiple levels that are crossed, e.g., two dose levels of drug A and two levels of drug B can be crossed to yield a total of four treatment combinations. Factorial designs offer certain advantages over conventional designs. The design can examine not only the differences among the levels of each factor, but also the interactions among the factors. For quantitative data of factorial design, direct multiple use of independent sample <italic>t-</italic>test will not only increase the probability of type I&#x000a0;error, but also lead to wrong conclusions when there is interaction between various factors.

However, according to the design principle, we know that repeated measures design uses the same subjects with every condition of the research, including the control. Thus, the measurements at different time points are correlated with each other, that is, the samples at different time points are not independent of each other. Roughly speaking, such data are often time-dependent. In this case, the appropriate analysis method is ANOVA of repeated measures designs. If there is another factor with independent samples, two-way ANOVA with mixed samples is recommended.</p><sec id="FPar13"><title>Example 5</title><p id="Par25">To study the difference for a certain indicator at different postoperative time points, 10 patients (5 males and 5 females) are enrolled in the study and the indictor of each of them is measured at 1, 2, 4, and 8&#x02009;weeks after the operation.

In addition, gender is another factor, which is an independent sample at each level. Thus, the overall design was separated by pairwise comparison at different time points through independent sample <italic>t-</italic>test and fails to take into account the fact that the data on the same subject at different time points are not independent.</p></sec><sec id="FPar15"><title>[Correction]</title><p id="Par27">Two-way ANOVA with mixed samples should be performed using the General Linear Model in SPSS (selecting &#x0201c;Analyze&#x02794;General Linear Model&#x02794;Repeated Measures&#x02026;&#x0201d;). Similarly, since the interaction between gender and postoperative time reaches the level of significance (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), it is necessary to perform simple primary effect test. However, since the gender factor is an independent sample and the postoperative time factor is a related sample, the test methods for the two factors are different. For gender factor, four independent sample one-way ANOVA analyses were performed based on the four levels of postoperative time, but for postoperative time factor, two related sample ANOVAs were carried out based on the two levels of gender. Using the original data, we can find that the difference between 1&#x02009;week after operation and 8&#x02009;weeks after operation is not statistically significant in males (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;0.057), but there is a significant difference between 8&#x02009;weeks after operation and 1&#x02009;week after operation in females (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;0.045), which was completely contrary to the results of independent sample <italic>t-</italic>test (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>).</p><p id="Par28">In summary, in order to effectively reduce misuse of statistical methods and improve credibility of the statistical results, it is necessary to carefully consider the experimental design type, distribution characteristics of the data, and other relevant factors. Concretely, we should meticulously review the applicable preconditions of each statistical analysis technique and reasonably select the appropriate method before analysis of quantitative data. In this paper, the five cases of most commonly misused <italic>t-</italic>tests are summarized, with the causes of each misuse analyzed and the more appropriate statistical methods are also offered in SPSS. By doing so, we believe that this paper can be helpful to the writing and editing of biomedical research papers.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec6"><p>

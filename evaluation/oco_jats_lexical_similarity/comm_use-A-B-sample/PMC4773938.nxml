However, the frequency of images showing smoking or other tobacco use in films has increased in many countries, the report notes. </p><p>&#x0201c;With ever tighter restrictions on tobacco advertising, film remains one of the last channels exposing millions of adolescents to smoking imagery without restrictions,&#x0201d; said Dr&#x000a0;Douglas Bettcher, Director of the Department of Prevention of Noncommunicable Diseases at WHO headquarters. </p><p>&#x0201c;Smoking in films can be a strong form of promotion for tobacco products,&#x0201d; Bettcher said. &#x0201c;The 180 Parties to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) are obliged by international law to ban tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship.&#x0201d; </p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/tobacco/publications/marketing/smoke-free-movies-third-edition">http://www.who.int/tobacco/publications/marketing/smoke-free-movies-third-edition</ext-link>
</p></sec><sec><title>Ending female genital mutilation</title><p>WHO highlighted the crucial role that health workers can play in helping to end the practice of female genital mutilation (FGM) on the international day of zero tolerance for female genital mutilation last month. </p><p>Health professionals should be properly trained to recognize FGM in patients and provide better clinical care for women who have undergone some form of FGM, WHO said.</p><p>Health professionals should also be trained and empowered to resist families&#x02019; requests to perform FGM. </p><p>FGM can be defined as any procedure that intentionally alters or causes injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. It may have devastating physical, psychological, and social consequences for the women affected. </p><p>&#x0201c;Health workers need evidence-based trainings to ethically manage requests by families to perform female genital mutilation, and accurately diagnose and manage women with complications from FGM,&#x0201d; said Dr&#x000a0;Lale Say, a reproductive health expert at WHO. </p><p>&#x0201c;Prevention and care require clinical guidelines and research to identify the optimal FGM management strategies,&#x0201d; she said. </p><p>More research is needed on the care that can be offered to victims of FGM to prevent and manage its complications. </p><p>Worldwide, more than 200 million girls and women have undergone FGM. Most live in 30 countries in the African, Eastern Mediterranean and South-east Asian regions.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/fgm/zero-tolerance-day">http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/fgm/zero-tolerance-day</ext-link>
</p></sec><sec><title>Guinea-worm disease near eradication </title><p>The number of cases of dracunculiasis&#x02013; also known as Guinea-worm disease &#x02013; decreased last year. </p><p>Considerable progress has been made despite emerging challenges, but not all data from 2015 are available yet. The final results of the efforts to achieve the international goal of interrupting transmission by the end of 2015 will only be known later this year.</p><p>Guinea-worm disease is caused by the parasitic worm <italic>Dracunculus medinensis</italic>, which migrates through the victim's subcutaneous tissues causing severe pain and disability. </p><p>The first symptom is intense itching, followed by a painful blister that usually appears on ankle or foot of the person infected. The worm eventually emerges from the blister. Its exit is normally accompanied by pain, fever, vomiting, nausea and diarrhoea. </p><p>Only 22 cases were reported in 2015 in the four remaining endemic countries: Chad, Ethiopia, Mali and South Sudan. This is a reduction of 83% compared with 126 cases reported in 2014. </p><p>&#x0201c;Security and access to endemic areas of Mali and South Sudan are the main challenges facing national eradication programmes,&#x0201d; said Dr&#x000a0;Dieudonn&#x000e9; Sankara from WHO&#x02019;s Department of Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases. </p><p>&#x0201c;Another challenge is the unusually high number of dogs with confirmed guinea-worm infections, particularly in Chad,&#x0201d; he said. </p><p>Efforts to wipe out the disease globally started in the early 1980s. The first eradication goal was set for the end of 2009 and revised to the end of 2015. </p><p>In 1989, Guinea-worm disease was endemic in 20 countries. To date, WHO has certified 198 countries, territories and areas as dracunculiasis-free. </p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/neglected_diseases/news/historic_low_number_GW_cases_reported">http://www.who.int/neglected_diseases/news/historic_low_number_GW_cases_reported</ext-link></p><boxed-text id="Bb" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Cover photo</title></caption><p>A woman looks out of her window in Brazil.

In 2014, two cases were reported, both linked to the 2013 outbreak in the Syrian Arab Republic.</p><p>In May 2015, Iraq was removed from the list of countries where polio had re-emerged following a series of vaccination campaigns supported by WHO, the United Nations Children&#x02019;s Fund and other partners. </p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.emro.who.int/irq/iraq-news/inactivated-polio-vaccine-introduced-in-iraq.html">http://www.emro.who.int/irq/iraq-news/inactivated-polio-vaccine-introduced-in-iraq.html</ext-link>

Two of them did not meet performance targets. </p><p>&#x0201c;While WHO recognizes that performance is certainly not the only factor, there are no health benefits in distributing products that do not meet minimum health standards and doing so may mislead users,&#x0201d; stated the WHO report on the results of its Round&#x000a0;I assessment.</p><p>Every year, WHO plans to test new technologies to help countries that are working to scale-up the use of effective household water treatment tools.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/household_water/scheme/household-water-treatment-report-round-1">http://www.who.int/household_water/scheme/household-water-treatment-report-round-1</ext-link>

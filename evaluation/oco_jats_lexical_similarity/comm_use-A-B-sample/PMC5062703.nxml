experimental surgery (general and cardiovascular) and cardiopulmonary bypass (under the
supervision of Dante Roman&#x000f3;).</p><p>He did his residency in Cardiovascular Surgery at the Instituto de Cardiologia do Estado
de S&#x000e3;o Paulo (ICE), currently, the Institute Dante Pazzanese de Cardiologia, in
1964 and 1965, remaining at that institution until 1969.</p><p>A competent, careful, and highly skilled surgeon, he stood out for his ideas and
experiments aimed at facilitating and improving surgical procedure outcomes.</p><p>He was in charge of the Experimental Surgery service of ICE, bringing his experience from
Curitiba in showing the same consideration for the experimental animal as he would for a
patient, doing postoperative care and following them up to "discharge".</p><p>He was the main contributor to the development of the ICE model of a vertical bubble
oxygenator, which incorporated an oxygenating column, a defoamer, a reservoir, and a
heat exchanger in a single device. That model, with its variations and improvements, was
the most used from 1964 to the emergence of the hollow-fiber oxygenators.</p><p>Likewise, he was responsible for developing the Starr-Edwards mechanical prostheses at
the ICE, also one of the most used in our midst for many years. After leaving the ICE,
he created Ind&#x000fa;stria Macchi, which brought numerous contributions not only to
cardiovascular surgery (cardiopulmonary bypass machines, oxygenators, cardiac
prostheses, tubes and accessories kit, support for bioprosthesis, among others), but
also to neuro (hydrocephalus valves) and bariatric surgery (gastric balloon). Macchi was
later bought by Edwards. Then, he founded another company, the HP Bio, which remains
active under the control of his children. At HP Bio, he developed the Biplus bileaflet
carbon cardiac valve prosthesis.</p><p>He defended his doctoral thesis at the Escola Paulista de Medicina (currently,
Universidade Federal de S&#x000e3;o Paulo - UNIFESP) in 1977, entitled "Bubble oxygenator
with heat exchanger for cardiopulmonary bypass: clinical applications, assessment of
performance and capacity".</p><p>Besides several activities in cardiovascular surgery, he had a brilliant teaching career
at the Organiza&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o Santamarense de Educa&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o e Cultura
(UNISA) Medical School in the Morphology, Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, and
Surgical Technique chairs, where he organized one of the best courses in this subject
among the medical schools. Thanks to his dedication and teaching standards, he received
several honors and awards. He was also a patron of the 7<sup>th</sup> graduating class
at UNISA, in 1983. During his teaching career, he published an excellent book on
Surgical Technique and Experimental Surgery, used as reference in many colleges, as well
as the <italic>Princ&#x000ed;pios de Radiologia do Cora&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o e dos Grandes
Vasos da Base</italic> (Principles of Radiology of the Heart and Great Vessels)
book.</p><p>It is with great sadness that we announce his passing on May 27, 2016. This memorial is
an important reminder to his many pupils, as an example of dedication, as well as to the
younger surgeons, who surely apply the legacy of this distinguished surgeon to their
surgeries.</p></body></article>

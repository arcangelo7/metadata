Organized trauma care is a coordinated effort to deliver the full spectrum of care to injured patients, from the time of the injury through community reintegration.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> The organization of pre-hospital care, acute care (that is, hospital-based care, including emergency, critical and surgical care) and rehabilitation services is typically administered by a public agency. The responsibilities of such agencies are to provide leadership, governance and appropriate finances, support prevention initiatives, coordinate service delivery, establish minimum standards of care, designate trauma centres, enable quality improvement programming and ensure system evaluation.</p><p>Organized trauma care, particularly when combined with multisectoral injury control initiatives, saves lives, limits disability, promotes productivity and lessens individual, community and national economic burdens. However, despite the human costs of trauma and the existence of evidenced-based and affordable interventions, national and global health agendas have failed to give priority to injury control and trauma care.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref></p><sec sec-type="other1"><title>Development assistance</title><p>To implement resolutions addressing care of the injured, the United Nations (UN) General Assembly resolution A/RES/58.289, the World Health Assembly resolutions WHA57.10, WHA60.22 and WHA68.15, and given the evidence demonstrating the cost&#x02013;effectiveness of trauma care,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> more must be done to finance and organize such care.

Although there is no consensus concerning the effect of development assistance for health, evidence suggests that it has significant and positive impacts on health outcomes in recipient countries.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> The sustainable development goal (SDG)&#x000a0;10, reducing inequality within and among countries, directs the global development community to encourage official development assistance and financial flows, including foreign direct investment, to countries where the need is greatest.</p><p>Much is known about the landscape of development assistance for health in general, in particular for high-profile global health conditions such as HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, and maternal and child health; however, the funding landscape for trauma care is less defined. Development assistance for health should be systematically reviewed to promote transparency and hold donors and recipient countries accountable to population and recipient countries&#x02019; needs. However, examination of development assistance financing flows highlights several gaps about development assistance for trauma care.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> First, such assistance is not aligned with national or global disease burdens. Second, development assistance for trauma care is critically underfunded despite numerous evidence-based, highly cost&#x02013;effective interventions that strengthen health systems broadly. Third, this assistance may be limited by a lack of injury-related technical expertise within donor and channel entities, that is, intermediaries between donors and recipients.</p><p>Ideally, development assistance for health would be dispersed in proportion to burden of disease and recipient national health system needs, and associated with an accountability framework.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> However, development assistance for trauma care has been estimated to represent less than 1.0% of all health assistance, while HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria received 36.0% of such assistance in 2017.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> That is, trauma care received 0.04 United States dollars (US&#x000a0;$) per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) incurred, while the corresponding amount for HIV/AIDS was US&#x000a0;$&#x000a0;4.05, tuberculosis US&#x000a0;$&#x000a0;25.09, malaria US&#x000a0;$&#x000a0;9.62 and maternal and child health US&#x000a0;$&#x000a0;45.75. Over the last three decades, this development assistance has resulted in remarkable gains related to disease-specific prevention and health system strengthening efforts, leading to reductions in the burdens of these conditions.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> On the other hand, in low- and middle-income countries, increases in injuries related to the epidemiological transition, motorization and development, ageing, violence, and failure to prioritize injury control and trauma care have created a health crisis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other2"><title>Domestic resource mobilization</title><p>Several concerns about development assistance for health have been raised. There is evidence that recipient countries have reallocated some of their domestic resources away from health to other sectors following inflows of such assistance. Other case studies have suggested that development assistance for health imposes substantial costs on recipient countries, partly because each donor has different application, monitoring and reporting requirements. There have also been concerns about temporal stability of health assistance given global financial crises, and how these might impact recipient countries&#x02019; health systems and their population health when such assistance is reduced. To mitigate some of these concerns, the development community has called for increases in domestic resource mobilization to match or contribute to common donor and recipient health priorities.</p><p>Domestic financing has increased in many countries with high burdens of injury, and in many cases, is no longer inconsequential compared to development assistance for health. Much might be gained from mobilizing domestic resources for trauma care, which may also have positive effects beyond improving care for the injured.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Such resources would allow governments to deliver an essential public good, trauma care, thereby strengthening national ownership of this health focus. Additionally, domestic resource mobilization is a facet of the broader good governance for health agenda that is required to catalyse greater progress towards universal health coverage (UHC) and health-related sustainable development goals.</p><p>In low- and middle-income countries, the deficits in trauma care relate to information, coordination, capacity and research. These gaps could be addressed with better planning and organization and only modest investments of domestic resources and/or development assistance for health.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> To achieve SDG&#x000a0;17.1, that is, &#x0201c;to strengthen domestic resource mobilization, including through international support to developing countries, to improve domestic capacity for tax and other revenue collection,&#x0201d; low- and middle-income countries could consider action. For example, additional taxes on alcohol, firearms, vehicle registration earmarked for injury control and trauma care organization, value-added tax that goes towards UHC, or tax incentives for trauma system capital investments. Similarly, development assistance for health disbursements and public-private partnerships could be designed to incentivize mobilization of domestic resources through matching programmes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other3"><title>Technical expertise</title><p>Evidence exists around injury control and organization of trauma to guide strategic disbursement of scarce funding.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Since injury has not been prioritized, existing donors and channels have limited technical expertise and infrastructure to identify potentially successful and/or cost&#x02013;effective interventions and programming. Injury control and trauma care technical expertise within government agencies, national and international professional societies, the World Health Organization (WHO), health institutes and academia could be leveraged to maximize the effect of health assistance for trauma care. Such action would result in the reduction of the injury burden and the strategic development of comprehensive emergency and trauma care systems.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other4"><title>Trauma care, UHC and SDGs </title><p>All UN Member States have agreed to achieve UHC by 2030.

The potential for these integrated care platforms to address a multitude of SDGs is further incentive to invest and implement organized care for the injured.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other5"><title>Way forward</title><p>Several opportunities to increase funding for injury control and trauma care, advocate for inclusion of injury in UHC and promote proportionally appropriate disbursement of development assistance for health for trauma care are available. National governments and the global health community should advocate for development assistance for health commensurate with disease burdens and current health system gaps. For example national governments could mobilize domestic resources through changes in prioritization and mechanisms related to injury. Development assistance for health should support low- and middle-income countries in strengthening essential trauma care, as outlined by WHO and the World Bank, in efforts to achieve UHC and progress towards the SDGs. Finally, donors and channels of such assistance should seek or develop injury control and trauma care technical expertise to guide disbursements towards high-impact, cost&#x02013;effective interventions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments:</title><p>BS and SH have contributed equally to this work.</p></ack><fn-group><title>Competing interests:</title><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="web">Injuries and violence, the facts.

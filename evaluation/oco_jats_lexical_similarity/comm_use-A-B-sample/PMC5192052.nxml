Epigenetic regulation plays an important role in the developmental origins of osteoporosis; however, few studies have investigated the potential of epigenetic therapy to improve or rescue the osteogenic ability of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) under osteoporotic conditions. Here, we investigated pargyline, an inhibitor of lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), which mainly catalyzes the demethylation of the di- and mono-methylation of H3K4. We demonstrated that 1.5&#x02009;mmol&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> pargyline was the optimal concentration for the osteogenic differentiation of human BMMSCs. Pargyline rescued the osteogenic differentiation ability of mouse BMMSCs under osteoporotic conditions by enhancing the dimethylation level of H3K4 at the promoter regions of osteogenesis-related genes. Moreover, pargyline partially rescued or prevented the osteoporotic conditions in aged or ovariectomized mouse models, respectively. By introducing the concept of epigenetic therapy into the field of osteoporosis, this study demonstrated that LSD1 inhibitors could improve the clinical practice of MSC-based bone tissue engineering and proposes their novel use to treat osteoporosis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based bone tissue engineering, a promising method to solve the most intractable clinical problems of bone defects, has provided hope to patients suffering from hard tissue loss that results from trauma, inflammation and tumors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> However, with the increasing onset of osteoporosis in an aging population worldwide, the practices of bone tissue engineering have been hindered in these osteoporotic patients because of their decreased osteogenic ability of autologous seed cells and unfavorable changes in the microenvironment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3 bib4 bib5">3&#x02013;5</xref></sup> Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) are one of the most commonly used seed cells because of their osteogenic differentiation ability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> Many studies have attempted to improve their osteogenic ability, such as via the addition of osteogenic factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> and the expression of exogenous genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> However, few studies have investigated how to improve or rescue the osteogenic ability of BMMSCs under osteoporotic conditions. Furthermore, recent research has reported that epigenetic regulation plays an important role in the developmental origins of osteoporosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> Thus, could the osteogenic differentiation of BMMSCs under osteoporotic conditions be improved through epigenetic therapy?</p><p>Epigenetic regulation, including DNA methylation, histone modification and RNA interference, refers to the mechanisms that regulate gene expression in a stable and potentially heritable manner without altering the DNA sequence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> Of the three epigenetic mechanisms, histone modifications and their accompanying histone-modifying enzymes form the most complex regulatory entity and play an important role in stem cell lineage commitment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> Modifications at different sites of histones can change the way that DNA is wrapped around them, which leads to changes in the folding or exposure conditions of gene promoter regions, thereby inhibiting or promoting gene expression. For example, histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4) can be methylated at three different levels: mono-methylation, dimethylation and tri-methylation. Increased methylation levels of H3K4 often indicate a more relaxed and actively transcribed state of related genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup></p><p>Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), a member of the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent amine oxidase family of demethylases, mainly catalyzes the demethylation of di- and mono-methylation of H3K4.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> LSD1 has an important role in transcription repression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> Moreover, in the field of epigenetic therapy, there is increasing interest in LSD1 as a potential drug target.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> Pargyline, a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, effectively inhibits the activity of LSD1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> Pargyline was used initially in the treatment of hypertension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> and also represents a promising anti-cancer drug in the field of epigenetic therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23 bib24 bib25">23&#x02013;25</xref></sup> On the basis of these clinical applications, the pharmacokinetics and safety considerations of pargyline have been evaluated,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> which makes its translation and potential application in the field of osteoporosis and MSC-based bone tissue engineering possible and easier. To date, there has been limited research regarding the effects of pargyline on osteoporosis and bone tissue engineering. Our previous studies have demonstrated that an LSD1 inhibitor promoted the osteogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> Could pargyline promote the osteogenic differentiation of BMMSCs, particularly under osteoporotic conditions?

Various attempts through different mechanisms have been attempted for the treatment of osteoporosis; however, the efficacy and side effects of existing methods are disputable. For example, the most widely used drugs, bisphosphonates, are associated with osteonecrosis of the jaw. Moreover, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and teriparatide lead to hypercalcemia. Therefore, new drugs that modulate different regulatory methods are being explored. In this study, we introduce the concept of epigenetic regulation and epigenetic therapy into the field of osteoporosis and MSC-based bone tissue engineering. We investigated the optimal concentration of pargyline for the osteogenic differentiation of human BMMSCs and the effects of pargyline on mouse BMMSCs under osteoporotic conditions, as well as its <italic>in vivo</italic> effects on osteoporotic animal models. This was not only a new approach to enhance the osteogenic differentiation ability of seed cells in bone tissue engineering through epigenetic regulation but also a novel exploration of epigenetic therapy for osteoporotic conditions.</p><p>With the advent of the post-genomic era, epigenetics has attracted increasing attention. Epigenetic regulation refers to the mechanisms that regulate gene expression in a stable and potentially heritable manner, without altering the DNA sequence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> Epigenetic regulation not only has an important role in stem cell lineage commitment but is also associated with many diseases, including cancer and aging-related problems, for example, osteoporosis and osteoarthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38 bib39 bib40 bib41">38&#x02013;41</xref></sup> The epigenetic regulation mechanisms include DNA methylation, histone modification and RNA interference. Of the three epigenetic mechanisms, histone modifications and the accompanying histone-modifying enzymes form the most complex regulatory entity. Our previous studies have demonstrated the epigenetic mechanism of osteogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hASCs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> The inhibition of the demethylase retinoblastoma binding protein 2 (RBP2) and lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) enhanced the osteogenic abilities of hASCs. However, to date, there has been no drug inhibitor of RBP2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> Therefore, the inhibition of RBP2 could only be attained via small interfering RNA using vectors such as lentivirus, which has substantially hindered its clinical application. Fortunately, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors inhibit the activity of LSD1. Thus, LSD1 has attracted increased attention in epigenetic therapies. Histone demethylase LSD1 (also referred to as <italic>KDM1A</italic>, <italic>AOF2</italic>, <italic>BHC110</italic> or <italic>KIAA0601</italic>) was the first identified histone demethylase and is a member of the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent amine oxidase family of demethylases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> LSD1 inhibitors are a hot topic in the field of cancer therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> However, few studies have investigated the effects of LSD1 inhibitors on the osteogenic differentiation of BMMSCs. Pargyline, an MAO inhibitor, effectively inhibited the activity of LSD1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> It has been used in the treatment of hypertension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> and is also a promising anti-cancer drug in epigenetic therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23 bib24 bib25">23&#x02013;25</xref></sup> On the basis of these clinical applications,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> the pharmacokinetics and safety considerations of pargyline have previously been evaluated, which make its translation and potential application in the field of osteoporosis and bone tissue engineering possible and easier. Therefore, pargyline was selected as our target drug.</p><p>The aim of our study included the future clinical use of small molecular drugs, such as pargyline, in osteoporotic patients; therefore, we selected human BMMSCs to investigate the optimal concentrations of pargyline. Subsequent studies of mouse BMMSCs under osteoporotic conditions were conducted according to this optimal concentration. ALP was used as the mid-term index for osteogenic differentiation. In addition, in AR-S staining, calcium deposition was stained dark red and represented the late-period index for osteogenic differentiation. Both the ALP activity and AR-S staining demonstrated the osteogenic advantages of 1.5&#x02009;mmol&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> pargyline together with classical OM. When pargyline was used without OM, the enhancement of the osteogenic ability was not obvious. Furthermore, the osteogenic ability increased with the increase in the pargyline concentrations from 0.5 to 1.5&#x02009;mmol&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. However, when the concentrations increased to 2 and 3&#x02009;mmol&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, the osteogenic ability decreased, which suggested that high concentrations of pargyline inhibit cell proliferation. The expressions of genes that encoded the osteogenesis-related proteins <italic>Runx2</italic> and <italic>OC</italic> further verified the osteogenic effect of 1.5&#x02009;mmol&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> pargyline. Thus, 1.5&#x02009;mmol&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> was the optimal concentration for human BMMSCs and was implemented for further experiments.</p><p>To investigate the effect of pargyline on BMMSCs under osteoporotic conditions, mouse bone marrow stromal cells were extracted from mice following OVX. The cells extracted from mice following a sham operation were used as the control. Bone marrow stromal cells may be separated from other cells in bone marrow by their tendency to adhere to culture plastic,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></sup> and the proportion of MSCs increased to 95%&#x02013;99% after 14 days of cell culture and routine medium changes in primary bone marrow stromal cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> With the increase in cell passage, the proportion of MSCs would be further increased as a result of the MSC capability of self-renewal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref></sup> Therefore, mouse bone marrow stromal cells at passage 2 without purification procedures were used in this study to represent mouse bone marrow-derived MSCs (BMMSCs). The osteogenic differentiation ability of these cells also confirmed that they were MSCs.</p><p>In this study, OVX BMMSCs demonstrated a lower osteogenic differentiation ability compared with Sham BMMSCs, particularly in OM, which indicated that the model of postmenopausal osteoporosis was successfully established by the ovariectomy operations and the osteogenic ability of BMMSCs was decreased in OVX mice. According to the ALP activity and mineralization assays, pargyline promoted the osteogenic differentiation of OVX BMMSCs when it was used in combination with OM. Interestingly, in the ALP quantification, the OVX BMMSCs with pargyline (OVX OP) group demonstrated a similar osteogenic ability compared with the Sham BMMSCs without pargyline (Sham OM). The AR-S staining and mineralization assays demonstrated a similar result. Less mineral deposition nodules were identified in the OVX OP group compared with the Sham OM on the 14th day; however, there was no significant difference between these two groups on the 21st day after osteoinduction. For the Sham BMMSCs, the effect of pargyline was not as substantial as the OVX BMMSCs. Differences were only identified on the 14th day of the ALP quantification and the 21st day of the mineralization assay. Therefore, pargyline promoted the osteogenic differentiation of OVX BMMSCs, and the effect was better compared with the Sham BMMSCs.</p><p>The potential epigenetic effects of pargyline were subsequently investigated. Pargyline is an MAO inhibitor that inhibits the activity of LSD1; however, we demonstrated that the <italic>LSD1</italic> mRNA expression also decreased according to real-time PCR. ChIP assays demonstrated that the dimethylation level was significantly increased at the promoter regions of osteogenesis-related genes, such as the genes that encoded <italic>Runx2</italic> and <italic>OC</italic>, following the addition of pargyline in both the OVX and Sham BMMSCs. The OVX BMMSCs demonstrated a more substantial enhancement of the dimethylation of H3K4 following pargyline addition compared with the Sham BMMSCs. Moreover, high levels of the methylation of H3K4 indicated the activation of related genes. The histone H3 level was simultaneously considered a positive control, and there was no significant difference in the H3 levels among the four groups (PM, PP, OM and OP), which indicates that the difference in H3K4me2 was comparable among the groups. In addition, the negative control IgG was detected to exclude the possibility of false positive results. Therefore, pargyline promoted the osteogenic differentiation of BMMSCs by enhancing the methylation level of H3K4 at the promoter region of osteogenic-related genes, and the enhancement was considerable for OVX BMMSCs.</p><p>For the <italic>in vivo</italic> study, we selected four groups, aging male mice, young male mice, female mice after ovariectomy and female mice after a sham operation, to investigate the effects of pargyline on two common clinical conditions, aging osteoporosis and postmenopausal osteoporosis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46 bib47 bib48">46&#x02013;48</xref></sup> as well as its effect on both genders. The growth plate area of femoral distal metaphysis was selected as the ROI for three reasons. First, the growth plate area is a relatively active region for new bone formation; thus, initial changes are more likely to be identified in this area.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref></sup> Second, the growth plate comprises a clear structure that is easy to recognize and define. Third, there have previously been a relatively large number of studies that have provided results for murine femurs, and values for the accuracy and reproducibility of these measures have been assessed,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref></sup> which ensured the comparability and reproducibility of our experiments. Radiological analyses and histological staining demonstrated that aged male mice and OVX female mice exhibited a decreased BMD, a lower BV/TV, fewer and thinner trabeculae, and increased trabecular spacing, which indicates that the models of aged osteoporosis and OVX osteoporosis were successfully established. Following the injection of pargyline, the numbers of osteoblasts were increased, whereas the osteoclast numbers remained the same, which led to an increased BMD, BV/TV and trabecular number and decreased trabecular spacing in the aged and OVX groups. However, the difference in the young and sham group was not significant after the injection of pargyline. Several important indices used to evaluate the bone quality and density improved after the injection of pargyline in aged and OVX mice; however, the indices could not reach the levels of their counterparts, i.e., young and Sham mice. These findings were in accordance with the <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments. BMMSCs play an important role in new bone formation. Therefore, pargyline promoted the osteogenic differentiation of BMMSCs, particularly under osteoporotic conditions, which thus promoted new bone formation in osteoporosis animal models. For young mice with normal bone metabolism, the demethylase LSD1 was likely to be inactive; thus, pargyline had less impact on the individuals with normal bones. Regarding the drug dosage, <italic>in vivo</italic> drug dosing cannot simply refer to the optimal concentration of an <italic>in vitro</italic> experiment because of the complex conditions of the body. However, the <italic>in vitro</italic> test provides important evidence for the <italic>in vivo</italic> experiment when the optimal <italic>in vivo</italic> concentration is vague. In this study, we referred to the <italic>in vitro</italic> concentration to conduct the <italic>in vivo</italic> experiment. An adult mouse (~25&#x02009;g in weight) has a circulating blood volume of ~2.5&#x02009;mL (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://web.jhu.edu/animalcare/procedures/mouse.html">http://web.jhu.edu/animalcare/procedures/mouse.html</ext-link>). The blood concentration of pargyline at 1.5&#x02009;mmol&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, the optimal concentration for the <italic>in vitro</italic> study, was used, and the injection amount of pargyline should be ~29.4&#x02009;mg&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (the molecular weight of pargyline is 195.69&#x02009;g&#x000b7;mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). According to this study, we conclude that this drug dosage was effective in the prevention of osteoporosis in OVX mice and partially rescued the osteoporotic conditions in aged mice; however, we cannot reach the conclusion that this drug dosage was the optimal dosage of pargyline for these animal models. A substantial amount of animal research based on dosage gradients is expected to select the optimal dosage of pargyline on osteoporosis. Therefore, this study demonstrated that a drug dosage of 29.4&#x02009;mg&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of pargyline was effective on osteoporosis; however, it may not be the optimal dosage for these animal models.</p><p>To introduce the concept of epigenetic regulation and epigenetic therapy into the field of osteoporosis and MSC-based bone tissue engineering, this study first promoted the osteogenic differentiation of BMMSCs using a small molecular drug, the histone demethylase inhibitor pargyline. This study investigated not only the effects of pargyline on human BMMSCs and mouse BMMSCs under osteoporotic conditions but also the epigenetic mechanisms involved in the enhanced osteogenic differentiation of BMMSCs. Furthermore, the <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of pargyline in rescuing osteoporotic conditions were also investigated. Therefore, a new concept arose that osteoporosis could be prevented or treated with epigenetic therapy. With a deeper understanding of epigenetic regulation, as well as more specific histone transmethylase and demethylase activators or inhibitors, future studies on other novel small molecular drugs with increased specificity and their efficacy compared with existing methods, such as bisphosphonates and PTH, will be investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Pargyline at the optimal concentration induced the osteogenic differentiation of human BMMSCs. In addition, pargyline rescued the osteogenic differentiation ability of mouse BMMSCs under osteoporotic conditions by enhancing the dimethylation level of H3K4 at the promoter region of osteogenesis-related genes. Moreover, pargyline partially rescued the osteoporotic conditions in aged animal models and prevented the formation of osteoporosis after OVX by increasing the number of osteoblasts, rather than influencing osteoclasts. This study provided an important theoretical basis that LSD1 inhibitors could improve the clinical practice of MSC-based bone tissue engineering and introduced their potential use in the treatment of osteoporosis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81200763 to WG and 81070809 to YZ), the Program for New Century Excellent Talents (NCET) at the University from Ministry of Education of China (NCET-11-0026), the PKU School of Stomatology for Talented Young Investigators (PKUSS20150107) and the Construction Program for the National Key Clinical Specialty from the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China (2011).</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob1">Supplementary Information</xref> for this article can be found on the <italic>Bone Research</italic> website (http://www.nature.com/boneres)</p></fn></fn-group><notes><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></notes><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="xob1"><label>Supplementary Figure S1</label><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="boneres201637-s1.tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec><ref-list><ref id="bib1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">Service RF. <article-title>Tissue engineers build new bone</article-title>. <source>Science</source>

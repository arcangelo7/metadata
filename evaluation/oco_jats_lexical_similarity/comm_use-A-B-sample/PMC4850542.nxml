The lessons are assessed against best practices set out in the Multistakeholder Dialogue Guide for Women&#x02019;s and Children&#x02019;s Health.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis in which codes are assigned based on a review of the text and then used to derive thematic categories.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref></p><p>The first lesson is the need for systematic analysis and time to identify participants and conduct key stakeholder interviews before the meetings.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> We initially had underestimated the time and coordination required for this preparatory work. Individual interviews have multiple benefits including: identifying additional sources of data; in depth exploration of specific policies, programmes and actors&#x02019; roles; and improving buy-in to the dialogue, particularly from non-health sector stakeholders. One interviewee pointed to a main challenge being the significant commitment required. &#x0201c;We invested substantial time in organizing and conducting the one-on-one meetings. The international and national consultants mostly contributed to that. Several staff from [the WHO country team] contributed as interviewers of high-level government persons&#x02026; and facilitated the appointments. It was a good collective effort.&#x0201d;</p><p>The second lesson is the importance and the challenge of engaging other sectors in the dialogue. As one national convener stated: &#x0201c;It was very difficult to get the non-health sector involvement. You have to use your connections, personal relationships. I would recommend getting the highest level in the health ministries to issue the invitations to the other sectors.&#x0201d; Including items from other sectors on the agenda helped engagement. In Peru, the meeting included a child nutrition review with participants from health and other ministries. The dialogues provided a relatively rare opportunity for cross-sectoral discussions on health-related topics. One participant said: &#x0201c;We were able to reinforce the point that the social determinants of these [health and development] problems are really similar and that it is important to avoid divisions.&#x0201d;</p><p>The third lesson is the need to give sufficient attention to the background evidence review, data sources and triangulation. Identifying data sources required significant time and effort, however, a framework outlining data requirements helped organize and streamline data collection. We expected that global data comparable across countries would provide a satisfactory background for the dialogues when in fact, considerable time had to be spent reaching consensus on appropriate sources of mortality and coverage data on a global, national or subnational level. When there were discrepancies, participants mostly preferred to use country-based data &#x02013; even if these showed less progress &#x02013; as they felt this information was more reliable and relevant to follow-up actions. Further, local data on policy, planning and systems inputs were often available, but had not been systematically reviewed during phase 1. In Bangladesh, data from national longitudinal databases and operational research helped quantify links between health outcomes and particular policy inputs.</p><p>The fourth lesson is the importance of developing and using agreed plausibility criteria for the dialogues (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="B1">Box&#x000a0;1</xref>). The criteria helped to address the challenge of defining best practices of the policy and programme management that contributed to mortality reductions. For instance, participants in Nepal used the temporal association criterion to identify different inputs and stages in long-term maternal mortality declines. The safe abortion policy in the early 2000s was important, but maternal mortality declines had started in the early 1990s due to other factors including reduced fertility rates, spousal separation (due to migrant work) and better antenatal care. In the Lao People's Democratic Republic, the scale criterion was important. Although coverage of health interventions had remained relatively low over time, participants determined that factors such as female literacy, infrastructure development and poverty reduction were critical to maternal and child mortality reductions.</p><p>The fifth lesson is the challenge of early planning and resource allocation for follow-up activities and implementation research. The country policy reports from the dialogues were presented at various national health meetings and have been used by policy-makers and media as reference documents. However, interviewees reported less use of the findings in policies and programmes than hoped for due to limited dissemination, budget and planning for follow-up actions. External evaluations of the dialogues and related implementation research are important considerations. However, these evaluations were not included in this initiative and would require substantial additional costs that need to be factored in the early planning phase.</p><p>The sixth lesson is key stakeholders are more likely to value and engage with the dialogues when they are integrated with ongoing national planning and policy cycles and linked to related regional and global processes to improve women&#x02019;s, children&#x02019;s and adolescents&#x02019; health. A main barrier to achieving these linkages in some countries was the limited timeframe to undertake the dialogue process. Linking dialogues to ongoing policy processes also requires considerable commitment, but is important for strengthening stakeholder engagement and ownership. Those countries in which the health ministry and WHO country team showed sustained engagement throughout the dialogue experienced wider involvement from key stakeholders and more commitment to long-term outcomes. While initially sceptical, many participants saw the dialogues as a unique opportunity to discuss national progress and tell their own story to an international audience. Indicating this sense of ownership, the health ministries in each country were lead authors of the country policy reports.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Ministerial representatives presented the findings at the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn &#x00026; Child Health&#x02019;s Partners&#x02019; Forum in South Africa in 2014<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> and provided media interviews that brought attention to the importance of country leadership and strategies used to accelerate progress.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> The Success Factors&#x02019; studies also informed the development of the global strategy.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref></p><p>The seventh lesson is that leadership at all levels is essential to advance multistakeholder dialogues.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> We did not fully anticipate the significant commitment required to build a coordinated effort for the dialogues. Leadership and commitment from the health ministries, country partners and national consultants, global and regional partner support, and strong engagement of the international consultants ensured that all phases were conducted within a limited timeframe. Consultants and conveners with deep technical knowledge of the topics, local system and familiarity with the stakeholders were critical to moving forward the dialogues, for example in China, Egypt and the Lao People's Democratic Republic. As one convener explained, &#x0201c;All stakeholders were actively participating in the meeting, discussing and giving their views willingly and positively, especially since the national consultant was known and respected by most of them.&#x0201d; In other countries &#x02013; such as Ethiopia and Rwanda &#x02013; the health ministries played a pivotal role.</p><p>This paper outlined the process and lessons learnt from multistakeholder dialogues that examined the evidence and identified policies and programmes that contributed to reducing maternal and child mortality during the MDG era. These dialogues can support multistakeholder analysis, action and accountability towards implementing the global strategy, improving women&#x02019;s, children&#x02019;s, and adolescents&#x02019; health and achieving the SDGs.</p></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Elizabeth McClintock (CMPartners); the multistakeholder dialogue conveners, consultants and participants in the countries; and the stakeholders who agreed to be interviewed for this analysis.</p></ack><fn-group><title>Funding:</title><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>The Partnership for Maternal, Newborn &#x00026; Child Health provided funding for this study.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group><title>Competing interests:</title><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><source>Multi-stakeholder dialogues for women&#x02019;s and children&#x02019;s health: a guide for conveners and facilitators.</source>

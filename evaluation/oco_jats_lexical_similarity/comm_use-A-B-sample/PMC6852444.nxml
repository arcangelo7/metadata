Hospital of Tunis in July 2017 for a physical fitness test. His past medical history
was not remarkable. He had no chest pain, no dyspnea or other specific signs. The
electrocardiogram (ECG) indicated a normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 65 bpm
and diffuse T wave inversion in anteroseptal leads. The transthoracic
echocardiography and the transesophageal echocardiography showed an enlarged right
ventricular dimension with no evidence of atrial septal defect. The Chest X-ray
revealed a lucent area due to the interposition of lung tissue between the aorta and
pulmonary artery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). In addition, a
cardiac computed tomography (CT) synchronized with ECG (64-slice detector, General
Electric Medical Systems) was performed to exclude the presence of anomalous
pulmonary venous return. The cardiac CT revealed a right atrial appendage herniation
in the retrosternal space with a non-visualization of the superior portion of the
right pericardium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">B</xref>).</p><p>

</p><p>Furthermore, the exam showed an interposition of lung tissue between the diaphragm
and the base of the heart and between the aorta and the superior vena cava (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">D</xref>) with no APVR found. It also confirmed the left lung interposition
seen in the chest X-ray. The right ventricular-to-left ventricular dimension ratio
computed by cardiac CT was 1.15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>). In
order to exclude a possible occurrence of arrhythmogenic right ventricular
dysplasia, a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) examination was performed.</p><p>Right end-diastolic volume index (RVEDi) and right ventricular ejection fraction
obtained by MRI were respectively 87 ml/m<sup>2</sup> and 58.6 % which is normal.
All these findings revealed by cardiac imaging examinations confirmed a diagnosis of
partial agenesis of right and left pericardium.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The absence of pericardium is a rare congenital malformation generally characterized
by non-specific symptoms. The majority of clinical cases reported in the literature
showed that the congenital absence of pericardium (CAP) includes a total absence of
pericardium and complete or partial absence of the left or the right side of the
pericardium. The possible embryological origins of this pericardial anomaly are not
well understood, but most studies demonstrated that it is due to defective
development of the pleuropericardial membranes<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. Among the different classes of CAP, the absence of the
left side of the pericardium is the most common defect with a prevalence of 70 %
while the incidence of the total absence of pericardium or the absence of the right
side of the pericardium is still relatively uncommon<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>For this reason, the majority of literature reviews have focused on the possible
symptoms, indications, and management algorithm that could be associated with the
absence of the left side of the pericardium. Among the typical clinical signs, we
could observe chest pain, dyspnea, the episode of acute respiratory distress leading
to syncope, palpitation<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. In the
majority of reported cases of CAP, the clinical presentation is not specific.
Patients are asymptomatic and the findings of this congenital disease are generally
occurring incidentally. In this regard, the advent of different cardiac imaging
modalities has significantly improved the specificity of the diagnosis of CAP by
providing valuable information and indications that confirm the presence of this
congenital heart disease.</p><p>In the current paper, a case of partial absence of right and left sides of the
pericardium is presented. The findings of our study showed that the present case was
asymptomatic without a remarkable medical history. In addition, the ECG showed a
regular rhythm with diffuse T wave inversion in anteroseptal leads. While physical
examination and ECG are not specific for the diagnosis of partial agenesis of the
pericardium, the echocardiography contributes to the identification of several
features related to this defect. The typical echocardiography findings of partial
agenesis of left pericardium include cardiac levoposition, abnormal septal motion
and increased mobility of the heart<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>A few case reports in the literature have shown the findings of echocardiography in
patients with partial agenesis of the right pericardium. Among the echocardiography
findings described by Shah et al<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>
associated with this type of defect, an enlarged right ventricle and hypertrophied
right atrium with severe tricuspid regurgitation could be observed.</p><p>In the current case, the echocardiography showed an enlarged right ventricular
dimension without an atrial septal defect. RVEDi obtained by MRI was 87
ml/m<sup>2</sup> which is normal. This finding indicated that echocardiography
showed a what appears to be a dilated right ventricle due to its anterior location.
This would tend to yield a larger measured right ventricular dimension. As a result,
the patient might be falsely labeled as affected by arrhythmogenic right ventricular
dysplasia<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In addition to the echocardiography, chest X-ray and cardiac CT play an essential
role in the confirmation of the diagnosis and to the exclusion of some complications
associated with partial agenesis of the pericardium. The chest X-ray showed that the
interposition of lung tissue causes a lucent area between the aorta and pulmonary
artery.</p><p>While echocardiography and chest X-ray exams are helpful in the extraction of some
partial agenesis features as well as in the exclusion of other cardiac diseases,
they are not able to confirm the diagnosis of partial absence of the pericardium.
For this reason, a Chest CT or a Magnetic Resonance Imaging are always required in
order to provide a definitive diagnosis and to assess the extent of the
abnormality.</p><p>The chest CT features of the absence of right pericardium include visualizing
herniation of right structure while the partial agenesis of the left pericardium is
commonly revealed by the interposition of lung tissue between the aorta and
pulmonary artery<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. All These CT
findings were shown in our case with a non-visualization of the superior portion of
the right pericardium. Furthermore, the outcome of the cardiac CT showed an
interposition of lung tissue between the aorta and the superior vena cava, which
strongly confirms a diagnosis of partial agenesis of right and left pericardium.</p><p>The management of partial agenesis of right and left pericardium depends on the type
and the extent of the pericardial defect. Usually, an intervention is not needed in
case of patients with a complete absence of the pericardium. Complications are more
occurring for patients with partial agenesis. Among the major complications that
required a surgical intervention, we can note necrosis due to the herniation of the
left atrial appendage, myocardial strangulation and incarceration of cardiac
structures. In our case, the patient does not have these complications. Therefore,
an intervention is not needed unless significant complications occur.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In the current paper, we presented a case with the congenital partial absence of both
sides of the pericardium. The outcomes of this study showed that this defect is
usually asymptomatic. For this reason, a combination of several cardiac imaging
modalities is needed to establish an accurate diagnosis of partial agenesis of right
and left sides of the pericardium.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="10%" span="1"/><col width="90%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" style="border-bottom-width:thin;border-bottom-style:solid" rowspan="1">Authors'

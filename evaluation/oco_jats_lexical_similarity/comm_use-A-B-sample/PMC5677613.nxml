Recent data suggest that many countries are struggling to meet that target.</p><p>&#x0201c;We urgently need new approaches and action on a dramatically different scale if we are to stop people dying unnecessarily from noncommunicable diseases,&#x0201d; said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, who announced the establishment of the commission on 10 October. </p><p>Last month government ministers and other health leaders from around the world reviewed progress countries are making in the fight against NCDs at the WHO Global Conference on Noncommunicable Diseases in Montevideo, Uruguay.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2017/ncd-commission">www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2017/ncd-commission</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>Child obesity set to surpass child underweight</title><p>The number of obese children and adolescents worldwide has increased tenfold over the past four decades according to a study led by Imperial College London and WHO.</p><p>If current trends continue, more children and adolescents will be obese than moderately or severely underweight by 2022, according to the study that was published in The Lancet ahead of World Obesity Day on 11 October.</p><p>The study presents the first ever comprehensive data on underweight through to obesity for children and adolescents aged five to 19 years old.</p><p>To coincide with the launch of these data, WHO published a summary of key recommendations from the implementation plan for the <italic>Report of the commission on ending childhood obesity</italic>. The report provides guidance to countries on the effective actions they can take to curb childhood and adolescent obesity.</p><p>Action to curb obesity and malnutrition are key elements of the <italic>United Nations 2030 agenda for sustainable development</italic>.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/end-childhood-obesity/news/new-estimate-child-adolescent-obesity">www.who.int/end-childhood-obesity/news/new-estimate-child-adolescent-obesity</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>Zoonotic tuberculosis roadmap</title><p>Close collaboration is needed between specialists working on human and animal health to combat bovine tuberculosis in animals and prevent its transmission to humans, known as zoonotic tuberculosis, according to a new WHO roadmap to combat this neglected form of tuberculosis. </p><p>Zoonotic tuberculosis is usually transmitted to humans through the consumption of dairy products or, less commonly, contact with contaminated meat from diseased animals. Airborne transmission from infected animals to humans can also occur.</p><p>The <italic>Roadmap for zoonotic tuberculosis</italic> was launched on 12 October at the 48th Union World Conference on Lung Health, which took place in Guadalajara, Mexico. </p><p>It was developed by WHO and its partners, the World Organisation for Animal Health, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease. </p><p>WHO estimates more than 140 000 new cases and 12 000 deaths every year due to zoonotic tuberculosis. These cases are mostly in Africa and south-east Asia. The impact of the disease extends beyond human health. Bovine tuberculosis threatens animal health and welfare, with a major economic impact on livelihoods and trade.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/tb">www.who.int/tb</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>Plague in Madagascar</title><p>WHO delivered nearly 1.2 million doses of antibiotics and released US$ 1.5 million in emergency funds to fight a plague outbreak in Madagascar last month.</p><p>Plague is endemic to Madagascar and some 400 cases of &#x02013; mostly bubonic &#x02013; plague are reported annually.</p><p>The current outbreak, however, is different &#x02013; with a much larger proportion of pneumonic cases affecting new areas of Madagascar, including large urban areas, thereby increasing the risk of transmission.</p><p>As of 11 October, 500 cases of plague &#x02013; including 55 deaths &#x02013; had been identified, higher than the number expected at this time of year.</p><p>A WHO team of 20 specialists in many fields including incident management, surveillance and field epidemiology, and clinical care were deployed to the island state to support 25 staff from the WHO country office, who are dedicated to the plague response.</p><p>&#x0201c;Plague can be cured when people receive prompt treatment with antibiotics. We are working with the government and partners to ensure that people know this and that adequate supplies of antibiotics are in place,&#x0201d; said Dr Charlotte Ndiaye, WHO Representative in Madagascar.</p><p>WHO&#x02019;s partners in the response include the United Nations Children&#x02019;s Fund, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent, the Madagascar Red Cross, M&#x000e9;decins Sans Fronti&#x000e8;res, M&#x000e9;decins du Monde and technical specialists from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network.</p><p>Plague bacteria <italic>(Yersinia pestis)</italic> are transmitted to humans by the bite of infected fleas carried by rats and other rodents, while pneumonic plague is transmitted from person to person.

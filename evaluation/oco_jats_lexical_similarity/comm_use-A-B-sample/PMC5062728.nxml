5<sup>th</sup> and the 15<sup>th</sup> centuries, is still commonly known as
the Dark Ages, especially in the area of health sciences. In the last decades,
this "classic" view of the Middle Ages has been gradually modified with advances
in historiographical studies and the history of science. During that period in
Western Europe, knowledge about the human body suffered a regression in terms of
anatomy and physiology, with the predominance of religious conceptions mainly
about diseases and their treatments. Knowledge on the cardiovascular system and
heart diseases has been classically described as a repetition of the concepts
developed by Galen from the dissection of animals and his keen sense of
observation. However, the Middle East, especially Persia, was the birth place of
a lot of intellectuals who preserved the ancient knowledge of the Greeks while
building new knowledge and practices, especially from the 8<sup>th</sup> to the
13<sup>th</sup> century. The invasion of the Arabs in North of Africa and
the Iberian Peninsula and the eclosion of the Crusades resulted in a greater
contact between the East and the West, which in turn brought on the arrival of
the Arab medical knowledge, among others, to 12<sup>th</sup> century Europe.
Such fact contributed to an extremely important change in the scientific medical
knowledge in the West, leading to the incorporation of different concepts and
practices in the field of cardiovascular Medicine. The new way of teaching and
practicing Medicine of the great Arab doctors, together with the teaching
hospitals and foundations in the Koran, transformed the Medicine practiced in
Europe definitely. The objective of this paper is to describe the knowledge
drawn up from the Middle Ages about the cardiovascular system, its understanding
and therapeutic approach to cardiologists and cardiovascular surgeons.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>History of Medicine</kwd><kwd>Medicine, Arabic</kwd><kwd>Cardiology</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The Middle Ages is the time period commonly defined between the 5<sup>th</sup> and
15<sup>th</sup> centuries, from the fall of the Western Roman Empire to the fall
of Constantinople. It relates mainly to Western Europe, but it is also extended to
the Byzantine Empire and the Arab kingdoms in the East. The medieval period was
given this name by the intellectual people of the 16<sup>th</sup> century. Eager to
revive the Ancient History and its knowledge, they defined the Middle Ages (from the
Latin media <italic>aetas, medium aevum</italic>) as the period of time between
theirs and the ancient ones. Quickly, it was called the Dark Ages because of
religious predominance, especially by the Christians in the West, as well as the
alleged delays in several areas of knowledge and the precarious living conditions of
the time<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>This period fits into the models of ancient society, related to quality and
expectancy of life. It is typical of pre-industrial societies, since there were high
birth and death rates, which suffered variations from insurgencies or facts contrary
to population growth, such as: plagues, climate change, wars and food shortages.
Three great epidemics weakened Medieval Europe. The epidemics of malaria between the
3<sup>rd</sup> and 5<sup>th[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> centuries; the plague between the 6<sup>th</sup> and
8<sup>th</sup> centuries<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>,
reducing the population level in Europe to the lowest number since the second
century; and the Black Death, between the 14<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup>
centuries, which caused the death of 1/8 to 2/3 of the European population,
depending on the region<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.
Although it is difficult to have reliable statistical estimates in the period due to
the precarious sources, life expectancy was between 20 and 30 years and the
mortality rate was about 30 and 40 thousand individuals a year, mainly because of
epidemics<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Medicine in the Western Middle Ages gained new forms with the religious predominance
of Christianity. Body and soul are interconnected in a complex philosophical and
theological dualism. Diseases and body ailments are seen as consequences of sins
inflicted to God, as the classic example of leprosy, present in the
Scriptures<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. Thus, the act of taking care of
patients becomes an obligation of religious people (nuns, monks and clergy), the
medical practice becomes an act of charity<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> and hospitals become places which provide more comfort than
cure<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. However, sick
people were also treated at a distance and in fear because of the possibility of
contagion, both physical and spiritual. In this context, the barber-surgeons,
healers and women who manipulated herbs were increasingly required for medical
treatment, even by religious people. Medical practice in the West only becomes
academic when doctors are graduated from universities, from the 12<sup>th</sup>
century on. Even with universities and physicians with academic knowledge, only
after long efforts, between the 13<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup> centuries, the
medical profession became more valued and more required than the healers and
barber-surgeons<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Medicine theoretical knowledge was based on Galen's formulations (four humors) and
extrapolations about anatomy and physiology of the cardiovascular system from animal
dissections<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. Galen's
ideas were incorporated and considered dogmas by the Catholic Church. Faith and
religious rituals were the basis to face diseases and epidemics, besides promoting
rituals and attitudes which involved prejudice, "witch hunts" and hysterical
behavior by the heavily present society in the Middle Ages
(10<sup>th</sup>-15<sup>th</sup> centuries). Gradually, the Western world
renewed its knowledge in different fields, particularly in Medicine, as a result of
the scientific and cultural splendor happening in the Islamic world. Such scientific
splendor comes to Europe through the knowledge generated by the Arabs, in the
reading of Greek texts and new ways to conduct medical training and patient care,
while in contact with the Arab world. The purpose of this review is to present the
knowledge created in the Middle Ages on the cardiovascular system and also the
advances in understanding diseases and approaches that emerged in the Middle
Ages.</p></sec><sec><title>THE WESTERN MIDDLE AGES AND GALEN'S VIEW</title><sec><title>Middle Ages and Medicine</title><p>The Middle Ages is commonly divided into two periods: the Early and Late Middle
Ages. The first period, characterized as the time interval from the
5<sup>th</sup> to the 10<sup>th</sup> century, is marked mainly by the
formation of Germanic kingdoms in Europe, the expansion of Christianity, the
founding of the Catholic Church as an institution, along with the organization
of the Carolingian Empire (800-888) and the formation of the Christian kingdoms,
arising from their fragmentation. With the emergence of the Carolingian Empire,
suzerain-vassal relations are developed, as well as feudal society. The
population level in Europe suffered a decline because of food shortages and the
spread of the plague, being gradually restored at the end of this period due to
further exploration of fields and forests for agriculture. The High Middle Ages
is marked by political stability of the Byzantine Empire in the East, the rise
of Islam, and the Arab expansion into Christian territories<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>On the other hand, the Late Middle Ages, the period between the 11<sup>th</sup>
and 15<sup>th</sup> centuries, is marked by several social, economic and
political changes in Europe. There was a strengthening of the feudal society
between the 11<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> centuries, predominantly
agrarian and stratified ones, politically defragmented and under the Church's
cultural and social control. However, at the same time, there was increased
population growth, development and spread of cities all over Europe, great
cultural development in arts, literature, education, philosophy and science.
This time is also marked by a closer contact between East and West, through the
Crusades, trade relations, as well as religious and secular expeditions in order
to know and absorb the knowledge of the Arab people. The final centuries of the
Middle Ages (14<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup>) are marked by political and
religious crises, the plague outbreak and the European territorial expansion
(commercially with Italians and territorially with the reconquered wars against
Muslims), which promote and permeate great changes that mark the following
centuries<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The medical practice itself can be verified in the temporal extents of the Middle
Ages. Before the 13<sup>th</sup> century, the practice of curing the body was
closely connected to that of curing the soul, considering the most identified
diseases as physical expressions of sins. This way, the task of taking care of
the sick people is relegated to the religious, including monks, nuns and secular
clergy, and to the laypeople who had practical experience on how to deal with
the sick. Hospitals are institutions that took a long time to be built in
medieval Europe, except for Spain, under Muslim control. It can be noticed,
before the 13<sup>th</sup> century, the presence of specific places in
monasteries to deal with itinerant sick people and monks, and also the houses of
God (<italic>domus Dei</italic> in Latin, <italic>h&#x000f4;tel - Dieu,
maison -Dieu, h&#x000f4;pital or hospice</italic> in French), places
where the major concern was the person's soul salvation, not the cure of the
body itself. Even after the existence of hospitals, from the 13<sup>th</sup>
century on, such places were considered a place to provide more comfort than the
cure itself<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>. Doctors, as professionals, also arise after
the 12<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> centuries, with the creation of
universities and the breaking of knowledge monopoly practiced by the monks.
Until then, the School of Salerno, founded in the 10<sup>th</sup> century, was
one of the few learning centers in Europe for medical practices. Despite
graduating from universities, doctors had to make a great effort for their
academic and practical knowledge to be recognized as the only ones viable in
patients' treatment, constantly fighting against the practice of healers,
barber-surgeons, superstitious and quacks, until the end of the Middle
Ages<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Galen's Knowledge</title><p>In the field of Medicine, specifically the one related to the knowledge of the
cardiovascular system, the Middle Ages could see the hegemony of the knowledge
created in the 2<sup>nd</sup> century by Claudius Galen (129 - 199?). Originally
from Pergamum, a Greek city under Roman rule, Galen made use of the majestic
city library, with more than 200 thousand books, to study all the philosophical,
scientific and Greek Medicine literature of the time. Galen also made use of the
information stored in the School of Alexandria, the main learning center of the
time, where he could find the largest library of the Ancient times and complete
skeletons, thereby allowing him to study the human body thoroughly. Then, he
became famous in Greek Roman Medicine<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p><fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig.1</label><caption><p>Ruins of the ancient Library of Alexandria.<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-31-02-0163-g01"/></fig></p><p>Galen treated several kinds of people, from gladiators to emperors. He
revolutionized the field of Medicine in his time through observations on the
human body, systematization of previous medical knowledge based on such
observations, experimentation and studies involving dissections of animals, like
pigs and monkeys. He was an heir of Hippocrates' Humoral Theory, reaffirming the
existence of four fluids, or humors, in the human body: blood, black bile,
yellow bile and phlegmatic. Such humors were divided into proportions for the
body and the necessary harmony among them resulted in perfect health. But, Galen
associated the humoral theory to Aristotle's ideas, which stated that the basis
of existence resided in four elements: water, air, earth and fire. This way,
each vital organ would have the predominance of one type of humor, which in
turn, would be related to a natural element. Each humor would then have its
temperature related to the nature element that it corresponded to, deriving the
four temperaments: blood, phlegmatic, melancholic, choleric. For Galen, all
diseases of the human body were the result of a temper, which excelled the
others, caused by the disharmony of humors<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p><fig id="f2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig.2</label><caption><p>Scheme of Galen's humoral theory.<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-31-02-0163-g02"/></fig></p><p>Galen's theories were ahead of his time, permeating throughout the medieval
period and still consulted until the middle of the 18<sup>th</sup> century.
Moreover, during the Middle Ages, Galen was recognized as an indubitable name
concerning the knowledge of the human body, being widely accepted by the
Catholic Church and studied by religious scholars, despite being Greek-Roman and
non-Christian. This is due to his heritage of Aristotelian thinking, which
stated that everything had a first cause, that could be identified and solved,
and everything would have an end because of this cause. His affirmation comes
from this idea, valid until today, that every change in body function is the
result of an injury and every injury involves a change in body function.
Christianity soon adapted this idea, identifying God as the cause of all things
and final salvation as the ultimate end of everything. Therefore, all things and
events were in God's perfect plan, and nothing happened by chance. Another fact
that facilitated such adaptation of Galen's thought, his acceptance and
diffusion of Christianity, was his belief in a single deity with the power to
interfere spiritually in the material world. Thus, the human body would be
simply an instrument of the soul, guided by this single deity. Due to such
conceptions, Galen's teachings could be accepted by the Catholic Church as well
as by Arabs and Jews, making the church reject any healing practice not endorsed
by Galen Medicine<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Some of Galen's advances were remarkable, such as the identification of the
presence of blood in the arteries rather than air, the discovery of blood
circulation in veins and arteries, and the existence of two ventricles in the
heart, each one responsible for a different function in the circulatory system.
Based on blood circulation, Galen identified the distribution of humors around
the body in addition to the fact that the heart has the function of feeding the
whole body with <italic>pneuma</italic> or spirit. Blood, full of impurities,
would go from the right side of the heart to the lungs to be purified by
breathing and then return to the right side. As a result, he identified two
major veins in the right ventricle responsible for this transport (pulmonary
artery and vena cava). After purification, the blood would pass from the right
side to the left by small invisible pores, there it would be again combined with
air and <italic>pneuma</italic>, then it would be distributed throughout the
body; here, he identified the aorta and the pulmonary veins on the left side. In
addition, Galen gave great importance to the liver, which would turn digested
food into blood and then send it to the heart to be filtered. Despite achieving
great advancements regarding blood circulation throughout the body, Galen said
that the venous and arterial systems were completely separated and not
connected<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p><fig id="f3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig.3</label><caption><p>Galen's Tripartite Scheme, explaining how the blood circulated
through the body.<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-31-02-0163-g03"/></fig></p><p>In short, Galen promoted great advances concerning knowledge on the anatomy and
physiology of the heart. However, he made some mistakes, most of them because of
ancient knowledge reproduction and the few opportunities for human body
dissection. His progress was essential and permeated a great part of the
knowledge present in medieval Western Europe until the 16<sup>th</sup> century,
but his mistakes were also reproduced, such as the presence of pores connecting
the right and left ventricles, the separation between the blood and venous
system, heart and blood function to distribute the spirit throughout the body
and the humoral theory, stating that all diseases and evils would come from the
disharmony between the amount of humors in each part of the body<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>ARAB MEDIEVAL MEDICINE: THE INFLUENCE OF QU'RAN AND THE GREAT MASTERS</title><p>A great part of the mistaken view still present about medieval history being
considered a period without scientific advances results from little knowledge on the
contributions of the Late Middle Ages, in particular the contributions of Arab
medieval Medicine.</p><sec><title>Panorama of the Arabs in the Middle Ages</title><p>Islam has its origins in the 17<sup>th</sup> century Arabian Peninsula. Until
then, the Arabs were divided into several tribes, most of them were polytheistic
religious nomads, whose main common cultural trait was their language and oral
traditions. Muhammad (570-632), who belonged to one of those tribes, was a
caravan merchant for most of his life. From the age of 30 on, he started to
receive revelations from Angel Gabriel. Those revelations were orally
transmitted among the Arabs and later formed the holy book of Islam, the
<italic>Qur'an</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>).
Strongly influenced by Persian Zoroastrianism, Judaism and Christianity, Islam
was established as a new monotheistic religion, eschatological, based on the
constant struggle between good and evil<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>. Muhammad managed to unify the Arabs, a fact that
contributed to the subsequent creation of the Islamic Empire, divided into
Caliphs, and unification of the Arabian Peninsula. The Islamic territorial
expansion was fast and intense. In the 7<sup>th</sup> century, the whole Arabian
Peninsula, Middle East, West India and North Africa were already dominated by
Islamic Caliphs, followed by the Iberian Peninsula conquest in the
8<sup>th</sup> century<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.
Christians were able to recover territories in the Middle East which were under
Arab rule, especially after Jerusalem's conquest in the First Crusade in 1099.
However, Christian ruling in the Middle East lasted only until 1187, with the
conquest of Jerusalem by the Arab Sultan Saladin<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>. The
Arabs lost their control of the Iberian Peninsula after the long reconquest wars
initiated by the Christians, which lasted from the 8<sup>th</sup> century to
1492, when they finally regained the territories of what is now Portugal and
Spain. However, the Muslim expansion continued on, with the muslim Turks being
subjugated to the Byzantine Empire, the Christian empire in the East, and
earning the capital Constantinople in 1453, thereby marking the end, for many
historians, of the Middle Ages<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.</p><p><fig id="f4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig.4</label><caption><p>Qur'an page of medieval times.<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-31-02-0163-g04"/></fig></p></sec><sec><title>The Philosophical and Religious Influence in Arab Medicine in the Middle
Ages</title><p>The East had always witnessed a certain advancement in Medicine compared to the
West. The first school-hospitals were founded in Persia by the Nestorians,
firstly founded as a Gondishapur school with a large hospital connected to it, a
practice which spread all over the Middle East<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The Arab medical schools could preserve ancient knowledge about medical arts,
mainly the Greek one, keeping, translating and copying essential pieces of work,
such as Hippocrates, Aristotle and Galen. In those schools, where we could find
both Arabs and Jews as well as Christians and Muslims of various ethnicities,
fragmented and dispersed knowledge of ancient authors was systematically
organized and translated, producing a wide understandable and accessible medical
literature in Arabic. This classic literature was constantly updated with new
documents written by the Arab doctors, based on both readings and experiences of
medical practice in school-hospitals. This way, as the basis of medical
conceptions remained according to Hippocrates humoral theory perpetuated by
Galen, and the knowledge of human anatomy remained limited due to the
prohibition of human body dissection, many innovations about the knowledge of
the body and disease treatments were carried out due to observation and
experimentation<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>It may be pointed as a cause of such advance, the medieval Arab contact with the
Hellenistic culture, especially regarding philosophy. When Islam replaced
Christianity in the East after the 8<sup>th</sup> century, the tradition of
reading the Greek classics could be observed in medical schools, where people
were taught mathematics, philosophy, theology and jurisprudence in addition to
Medicine. The result was an increasing contact with Aristotelian philosophy and
the consequent enhancement of the sensible world, considered a possible world to
know, contrary to what happened in the Christian West in the same period of
time, where the sensible world was wrong and imperfect. Thus, for the Arabs, the
body knowledge, in its anatomical and physiological form, is considered
extremely important, whereas according to Christianity, until the
12<sup>th</sup> century, the body is just the place for sins and its
sickness would only come from the spiritual world. However, Arab philosophy
mixed with theology, and ultimate knowledge would come from God<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>On the other hand, even regarding the religious aspect, we notice some facts that
contributed greatly to the development of Arab Medicine. The two sacred Islamic
books which compose the Sacred Law, or <italic>Shariah</italic> (path), are the
<italic>Qur'an</italic> (revelation given directly by Allah to Muhammad) and
the <italic>Hadeeth</italic> (practical lessons pronounced by Muhammad). Here,
we may see a great importance given to medical knowledge. Arab teachers and
doctors encouraged and constantly searched for new knowledge and research that
resulted in major discoveries based on the sacred writings. Every disease had
been created by God and He had created a cure for each of them, not only cures
and spiritual treatments, but also the treatment received by doctors was
encouraged, since it was one of the ways whereby God provided the cure for human
diseases. Most of the teachings regarding healing and disease prevention
contained in the sacred books refer to lifestyle, food and personal hygiene
habits, besides containing some guidelines on minor surgeries. For all that, the
appreciation of doctors as healers authorized by God allowed for the
construction of new knowledge about the anatomy and physiology of the human
body, as well as diseases and their treatments discovered by Arab
doctors<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In addition to information on treatments and cures of diseases in general, the
sacred writings bring great information about specific heart diseases, and also
physiological and anatomical information. The heart is considered the center of
emotions, actions, intentions, desires and knowledge, and, many times, the
diseases are related to the emotional state (anger, fear, aggression, etc.) and
even to the spiritual one (life in sin, blasphemy, unbelief).</p><p>Nevertheless, besides the spiritual view, there are several references of an
anatomical knowledge of the heart, like a muscle, as in the passage in which
Angel Gabriel would have performed a surgery on Muhammad, extracting a blood
clot from his heart. There is also reference to the knowledge of veins and
arteries and their vital importance, because the sacred books say that God
created man's life and could take it, cutting either his jugular vein or the
<italic>Al- Watin</italic> (aorta)<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Such references about medical concepts in the sacred books can be derived from
the contact Muhammad had with doctors graduated from school-hospitals. Many of
the Arab tribe nomads attended those hospitals, like the Gundishapur one, in
order to go back to their tribes and treat the sick people there. Muhammad had
great contact with the doctor al-Harith bin Kalada, who influenced him mainly on
hygiene notions present in the <italic>Qur'an</italic><sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Great Arab Doctors and their Contributions to Cardiovascular Medicine</title><p>Medieval Arab Medicine culture, especially the one developed between the
8<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> centuries, provided the advancement of
medical science knowledge at school-hospitals; this knowledge was based on
ancient writings and practical experiences, supported by philosophical and
religious bases<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>. Besides the
general field of Medicine, there was a great development in knowledge about the
heart, regarding its anatomy and physiology, diseases and their treatments. To
demonstrate the scientific advancement of that time, we have chosen three Arab
doctors who showed important contributions to the knowledge of the
cardiovascular system: Haly Abbas (? 930-994), Avicenna, or Ibn Sina (980-1037)
and Ibn al-Nafis (1210-1288) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure

time between two great names of Arab Medicine: Rhazes and Avicenna. He was the
court physician of Adud al-Dawla-Fana Khusraw (936-983), king of Persia, and
also at Azodi Hospital in Baghdad, where he wrote his most important piece of
work "The Complete Book of Medical Art" (<italic>Kamil al-al
sina'ah-Tibb&#x0012b;yah</italic>), or "The Royal Book" (<italic>al-Kitab
al-Maliki</italic>). It is in this encyclopedic book that we can find the
greatest references by Haly Abbas concerning the knowledge of the heart, in
which we notice his remarkable effort to reject some of Aristotle's and Galen's
outdated ideas. On the question of the venous and arterial system, Haly Abbas
made the first distinctions between veins and arteries based on their thickness,
in addition to a detailed description about the descending aorta of the thoracic
structure<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>. Yet, his greatest
contribution was making one of the first mentions about a connection between the
venous and arterial system, describing it in the following way in the "Royal
Book": "<italic>...There are some foramina within the non-pulsating vessels
[veins] that open to the pulsating vessels
[arteries]...</italic>"<sup>[<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Furthermore, he made great advancements in the anatomical description of the
heart, although not with the nomenclature being used nowadays. He described the
heart as two main chambers, one on the right and another on the left, the latter
being where the arteries would have their origin, and considering the liver the
origin of the veins. He also recognized the existence of two atria and two
auricles as well as the aortic and mitral valves, describing their
characteristics and the presence of the pericardium<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The great Arab master Avicenna promoted what we consider the biggest set of
developments related to medical science, in particular on the knowledge of the
cardiovascular system, and he was the most influential Arab intellectual person
in both the East and the West. He was also originally from Persia. Avicenna was
exceptional, having memorized the entire Persian literature at 10 years old,
including the <italic>Qur'an</italic>, and becoming a famous doctor at the age
of 18. He wrote more than 450 books, namely about astronomy, logic, philosophy
and Medicine treaties. Avicenna wrote all this literature living a troubled life
of persecution and escapes due to his political opposition to the Persian
government. His major works on Medicine are: "Canon of Medicine" (<italic>al-
Qanun fi al- Tibb</italic>), "The book on drugs for cardiac diseases"
(<italic>Kitab al- Adviyt al- Qalbiye</italic>), and the less well-known
"Book on Pulsology" (<italic>Resaley and -Ragshenasi</italic>). He made great
progress in the anatomical knowledge of the heart, although he had accepted some
of Galen's misconceptions, such as the existence of pores connecting the two
ventricles of the heart, allowing the passage of blood from the right to the
left side. He recognized the origin of the arteries on the left side of the
heart and veins in the liver; moreover, he identified the difference between the
thickness of the left and right ventricle walls. In addition, he was the first
to mention the difference in atria and ventricles contractions, as well as the
existence of capillary circulation<sup>[<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>-<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p><fig id="f6" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig.6</label><caption><p>Avicena.<sup>[<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-31-02-0163-g06"/></fig></p><p>Avicenna was greatly influenced by Hippocrates' and Galen's humoral theories, and
reproduced much of such theories in his writings, especially when he made
descriptions of several diseases. However, even using humoral theory as a basis,
it is evident the advancement of theorizing and observation of heart ailments
made by Avicenna. Atherosclerosis was identified by him, though not by this
name, because it was recognized that the abnormal accumulation of moods in the
veins and other areas could cause obstruction, and the worst obstructions are
those which happen in the arteries of vital organs, such as the brain, heart and
liver. Vasovagal syncope was also observed by Avicenna, although it received the
name of <italic>al- Lawa</italic>. He discovered that patients who had
tiredness, fatigue and flushing suffered from a humor disharmony during the
distribution of humors throughout the body through the blood. According to
Avicenna, there would be a predominance of bile, warm humors in the heart, and
the brain would be predominantly cold with the phlegm, cold humor. The
<italic>al-Lawa</italic> would be the result of poor humor distribution
around the body, with an excess of black and yellow bile, hot humors that caused
brain malfunction, being sent to the brain. This would result in tiredness,
fatigue and flushing, nowadays recognized as vasovagal syncope symptoms.
Nevertheless, not all diseases referred to humor disharmony, such as
palpitation, identified by Avicenna as a heart physiological distress caused by
lesions in its external coating or in organs next to it. Palpitation, when it
became acute, caused fainting, and when it became constant could cause death as
well<sup>[<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>-<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7</xref>). </p><p><fig id="f7" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig.7</label><caption><p>Persian calligraphy copy of the Canon of Medicine.<sup>[<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-31-02-0163-g07"/></fig></p><p>Avicenna was also a pioneer in relating a patient's pulse rate with evils and
internal feelings, thereby advancing in the studies of the arterial pulse and
being the first to measure the wrist pulse. He identified several circulation
changes related to the patient's conditions, such as age, gender, drinking and
food consumption, anger, fear, pregnancy, diseases and even in relation to
weather conditions. Many recent studies have proven those
associations<sup>[<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>-<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup>. In the end, Avicenna also
ventured into the field of Medicines to cure diseases. His book about drugs for
heart ailments has countless composition forms, some of them have effect on the
cardiovascular system and are currently established as the 'zarnab' drug, which
is a calcium channel blocker<sup>[<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Finally, we present one of the less well-known Arab doctors of the
13<sup>th</sup> century, who made perhaps the most important and surprising
discovery about the heart anatomy and physiology. Ibn Al-Nafis was born in 1213
in Damascus. He studied at the school-hospital in the city. Physician and
professor in Egypt, he was the author of several pieces of work, the most
important ones being "The Comprehensive Book on the Art of Medicine"
(<italic>Kitab al-Shamilfi 'l-Sina'a al-Tibbiyya</italic>), which consisted
of 300 volumes, though it was not completed, and the "Commentary on Anatomy in
Avicenna's Canon" (<italic>SharhTashrih Qanun al</italic>), comprised of 80
volumes. Ibn Al-Nafis stands out for the clear criticism of Galen and Avicenna,
pointing out the flaws and mistakes in their theories, which was something
almost unthinkable to be done at a time when the ancient writings represented
the truth. Most likely he had dissected human bodies to have his greatest
achievement: the discovery of the pulmonary circulation<sup>[<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>-<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8</xref>). </p><p><fig id="f8" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig.8</label><caption><p>Illustration of the minor circulation of blood according to Ibn
al-Nafis.<sup>[<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-31-02-0163-g08"/></fig></p><p>Ib-Al-Nafis described the pulmonary circulation like this: "<italic>The blood
from the right chamber of the heart must arrive to the left chamber,
however, there is no direct pathway between the two sides. The thick septum
of the heart is not perforated and has no visible pores as some people
thought (referring to Avicenna) or invisible pores (in reference to Galen).
The blood from the right chamber must flow through the vena arteriosa
(pulmonary artery) to the lungs, spread through its substance, be mingled
with air while in the lungs, pass through the arteria venosa (pulmonary
vein) to reach the left chamber of the heart to form the vital
spirit</italic>"<sup>[<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Moreover, he was the first to describe the role of coronary arteries, which are
truly responsible for nourishing the heart<sup>[<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>The Late Middle Ages: the Arrival of Arab Medical Scientific Knowledge and
its Transformations</title><p>All this knowledge produced by the Arab masters, added to the various
translations of the Greek classics into their language, reached the Christian
West and changed deeply the way of teaching and practicing Medicine. The most
remarkable contact between the Christian West and the Muslim East was clearly
warlike. The crusades greatly marked the way of thinking of the time, causing
great aversion to Islam in Europe, especially among the religious ones. However,
the contact with Arab culture as a result of the Crusades conduced to a search
for Arab works and their translations in order to better understand the enemy
against whom the Christian West fought<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Italy had already flourished in business since the 11<sup>th</sup> century,
keeping constant trade with the East, and the Muslim-ruled Iberia was quite open
to contact with the European Christians, considering they were coming from a
tradition of tolerance toward Christians and Jews within their own boundaries.
It was through those commercial and cultural contact centers that Arab scrolls
entered the Western Christian world, being translated into Latin and influencing
many intellectuals of the time<sup>[<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</sup>. Particularly noteworthy is a doctor called Constantine,
the African, who worked for forty years in Syria, India, Egypt and Ethiopia
before taking part in the doctors' and teachers' group at Salerno school, the
first medical school in Europe. He came up with several manuscripts, extensive
background and medical techniques<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>. Thus, Greek classics which were forgotten for a long time
in the West, such as Hippocrates', Galen's and Aristotle's, as well as new
writings made by the Arabs in the fields of philosophy, arithmetic, Medicine,
among others, entered the medieval Christian area early in the Late Middle Ages.
During this period of time, between the 12<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup>
centuries, Europe experienced an outbreak and growth of cities, the creation of
the first universities and a greater knowledge secularization. Arab works, then,
were read by intellectuals, scholars and even religious people, modifying
gradually the philosophical and scientific conceptions of medieval
Europe<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The reading of Arab medical works and the change in the intellectual scene in
Europe generate important transformations in Medicine at the time. Gradually,
professionals who had only practical knowledge go to universities in search of
greater knowledge. During the 13<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup> centuries, the
graduated doctors fought against healers and barber-surgeons, with the purpose
of being recognized as the most prepared ones to deal with patients. Moreover,
it is when the need for body anatomy knowledge in medical training arose in
Europe. In 1240, Emperor Frederick II, of Naples, insisted that it was necessary
for the surgeons to have anatomy training. However, the first milestone in the
history of public dissections at universities, in terms of teaching, occurred
only in 1315, in Bologna, by physician Mondino De' Luzzi; the same happened in
Montpellier, only in 1376, and in Paris in 1407. Despite being discreet and
facing various religious difficulties, this first step towards an observation
science marked the beginning of progress made in the Renaissance in Italy,
mainly in the medical field<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>.
Therefore, the great names of the Renaissance, such as Leonardo Da Vinci,
Michael Servetus, Andreas Vesalius and William Harvey could dissect and observe
corpses, making great advances in Medicine and especially on the knowledge of
the cardiovascular system<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</sup>, probably being great readers of Arab works on the
subject. Michael Servetus in his "<italic>Christianismi Restitutio</italic>"
work of 1553 talks about Ibn Al- Nafis' great advances regarding pulmonary
circulation, compiling part of his work. But, not mentioning the Arab author,
pretending to be the original author of the groundbreaking discoveries until not
long after finding Ibn Al- Nafis' books<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>-<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Medicine and cardiovascular science in the medieval times, rather than presenting a
great stagnation, received important contributions from philosophical ideas, as well
as Arab medical knowledge. Arab medical science had already made great contributions
in the sacred books of Islam, in particular on disease prevention and the
cardiovascular system anatomy. At the same time, bright doctors and teachers,
especially Avicenna, revolutionized cardiovascular knowledge, founded and taught at
the first school-hospitals, and refuted the traditional knowledge present in Galen's
work. During this time, when Europe remained under the aegis of the Catholic Church,
it received strong and definite influence from the Arabs, such as the creation of
the first medical schools and universities. That influence provided advances
concerning the knowledge of the cardiovascular system produced in the
Renaissance.</p><table-wrap id="t1" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="10%" span="1"/><col width="90%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ASR</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Conception and study design; analysis and/or data interpretation;

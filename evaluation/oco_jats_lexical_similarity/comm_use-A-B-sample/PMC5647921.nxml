It rewards general practices financially for delivering interventions and achieving patient outcomes using evidence-based indicators developed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Although the QOF is voluntary, nearly 99% of practices in England participate, on average deriving 10&#x02013;15% of total practice income from the scheme.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>The introduction of the QOF in 2004 was a part of a new national contract for GPs, driven by the need to respond to years of underinvestment in general practice compared with other parts of the health service, low morale among GPs, and variations in the quality of primary medical care.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The QOF was intended to provide a mechanism to motivate GPs and to increase funding for their practices, and the vast majority of practices took up the opportunity for additional income. Evidence from the early years of the scheme suggested it reduced variations between practices in the delivery of incentivised interventions,<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and contributed to progress towards better use of electronic records and nurse-led multidisciplinary care of long-term conditions.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> After the first year of the QOF, most practices achieved near-maximum remuneration from the scheme.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Arguably, then, the QOF achieved what it set out to do. But this may have come at a cost. It has been suggested that practices prioritise QOF-related activities at the expense of other aspects of care, because of their reliance on QOF income.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>A decade after the introduction of the QOF, NHS strategy, set out in the 2014 <italic>Five Year Forward View</italic>,<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> is now focused on other challenges. These include finding new ways to manage people with long-term conditions, whose care is estimated to consume 70% of health service resources.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Most clinical QOF indicators relate to the care of long-term conditions and are based on good evidence,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> but tend to be limited in scope, focusing on single, biomedical dimensions of care. <xref rid="app1" ref-type="app">Appendix 1</xref> provides a brief description of the 68 QOF indicators relating to care of long-term conditions in 2016&#x02013;2017; the total number of indicators for that year was 77.</p><p>In 2015, the Royal College of General Practitioners called for the replacement of the QOF to allow GPs <italic>&#x02018;to focus on providing the best possible holistic care&#x02019;</italic>.<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> NHS England, in April 2016, undertook to review the QOF, acknowledging that it may have <italic>&#x02018;served its purpose&#x02019;</italic> and may be <italic>&#x02018;a barrier to holistic management&#x02019;</italic>.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> In early 2017, the British Medical Association called for the QOF to be suspended to reduce bureaucratic pressures and free up clinical time.<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Scotland abolished the QOF in 2016.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>The Policy Research Unit in Commissioning and the Health Care System was commissioned to undertake a review, led by the Centre for Health Services Studies at the University of Kent, to report in September 2016. The authors aimed to examine the evidence that the QOF has improved care and outcomes for patients with long-term conditions, including elements of care highlighted as priorities in the <italic>Five Year Forward View</italic>,<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> such as coordinated and integrated care, holistic and personalised care, and self-care.</p><boxed-text position="float"><sec><title>How this fits in</title><p>The usefulness of the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) as a tool for promoting progress towards the vision of the <italic>Five Year Forward View</italic> for care of long-term conditions has been questioned. This systematic review found no convincing evidence that the QOF can promote better integrated care, personalised, holistic care, or self-care &#x02014; or, indeed, improve any other outcomes in people with long-term conditions. The NHS should consider other ways of supporting general practice to deliver the vision of the <italic>Five Year Forward View</italic>.</p></sec></boxed-text></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHOD</title><p>The authors searched for reports of empirical quantitative research examining the effectiveness of the QOF in the management of long-term conditions, published in peer-reviewed journals in English. They included studies of populations registered with GPs in the UK, and excluded studies of locally designed and implemented pay-for-performance schemes, and studies of limited geographical scope (which were defined as examining data from fewer than four primary care trusts in England, or fewer than 100 practices in Scotland) because of likely low generalisability. The authors included studies where the comparator was any other method of funding general practice, concurrent or historical, and, if there was no concurrent comparator, where the analysis controlled for underlying trends. They set no limits on outcomes except that they were measured quantitatively and related to patients with long-term conditions, including:

They excluded cross-sectional studies examining how outcomes varied according to QOF achievement, because of the lack of suitable controls, the near-universal high level of achievement, and the high likelihood of confounding of associations between QOF achievement and outcome by other factors. The authors also excluded studies in which the researchers estimated or modelled outcomes rather than reporting empirical data (more details of the inclusion and exclusion criteria are available from the authors). The authors searched electronic databases (Cochrane Database, Medline, Embase, and Health Management Information Consortium) for studies published between 2004 (the year the QOF was introduced) and May 2016 (see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1">Box 1</xref> for search terms).

In the context of a demoralised primary care workforce, it is important also to consider ways other than financial incentives to motivate primary care teams to deliver high-quality care.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>To the authors&#x02019; knowledge, this review is the first to have specifically addressed the effect of the QOF on those aspects of care for long-term conditions that are prioritised by national policy. As with any systematic review, the authors&#x02019; conclusions are constrained by the limited quantity and quality of the primary research published to date. Although the search for quantitative research was comprehensive, the authors did not include qualitative research, which may provide other insights.</p><p>Research to date has not attempted to identify the effects of the QOF on any of the broader aspects of care for long-term conditions, having examined effects only on more easily measurable outcomes, for example, those collected as part of the QOF, or routinely available data on mortality, emergency admissions, consultation rates, and prescribing. The authors found no evidence of attempts to evaluate the QOF using validated measures of quality of care in general practice. Perhaps this is because defining and measuring quality of general practice is complex.<xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></p><p>The lack of effect of the QOF on mortality is surprising, given that the indicators are based on high-quality evidence of effectiveness of interventions. Why this is the case is not clear. The wider determinants of population health (including low income, experience of inequality or discrimination, or quality of air, education, housing, or work conditions<xref rid="b45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) may be much more important than the quality of care in determining mortality. Also, it is recognised that the effectiveness of interventions demonstrated in randomised controlled trials, which include highly selected study participants, is often diluted in routine clinical practice.<xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Perhaps non-incentivised activities are more important in determining mortality in the patient population. It is also possible that practices misreport performance so as to exaggerate the quality of care, although there is little evidence that this is a significant problem.<xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></p><p>The authors found evidence that the QOF was associated with a modest slowing of the increase in emergency admissions for conditions for which care is incentivised by the QOF, and an increase in primary care attendances for people with serious mental illness. Whether the QOF is responsible for these is unclear; many other factors are likely to have influenced admission and attendance rates over the period, including changes in medical technology or access to other services, or national standards for management of long-term conditions. In any case, among interventions to prevent emergency admissions, pay-for-performance is unlikely to be one of the most effective.<xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></p><p>It could be argued that some QOF indicators &#x02014; in palliative care, cancer, SMI, dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis &#x02014; incentivise multidisciplinary meetings, reviews, and care plans, considered necessary elements of holistic and integrated care (as set out in recent guidance from NICE).<xref rid="b50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> However, to achieve the indicators, practices are not required to demonstrate that their activities ensure that holistic or integrated care has been delivered.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Implications for research and practice</title><p>The authors found no convincing evidence that the QOF promotes better care and outcomes for people with long-term conditions. QOF may also have negative effects. If practices have achieved maximum or near maximum points under the scheme (which is true for most practices), they have little motivation to improve achievement further. It is likely that the QOF diverts practices and professionals from ways of providing high-quality primary care that is not QOF-related. Moreover, the QOF does not incentivise practices to improve care for patients with the most complex needs in primary care, because these are more likely to be excepted from the scheme.<xref rid="b51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> Raising thresholds for achievement may be counterproductive &#x02014; there is evidence that it leads to increased exception reporting, raising apparent achievement with no real increase in the desired activity.<xref rid="b52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></p><p>The Chief Executive of the NHS announced in October 2016 that the QOF would be phased out.<xref rid="b53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> What would happen to the quality of primary care if the QOF is completely abolished is not clear, although it seems unlikely that standards would drop significantly, because the activities rewarded in the QOF are now firmly embedded in practice. There is some limited evidence to suggest that performance did not fall following the withdrawal of certain individual indicators from the scheme.<xref rid="b54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> Abolishing the QOF may also allow practices to prioritise other activities, which could lead to better care.</p><p>The QOF provides a major component of practice income; if it were abolished, practices would need to be assured of a stable income. Losing this is likely to have detrimental effects on patient care and further worsen recruitment and retention in primary care, which is once again in a precarious position.<xref rid="b55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></p><p>Alternative methods of rewarding good practice are being considered for new models of primary care.<xref rid="b56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> Any replacement for the QOF needs to consider the evidence of effectiveness of pay-for-performance in primary care, and the evidence of what motivates primary care professionals to provide high-quality care.<xref rid="b57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Ms Anna Peckham, consultant librarian, for her assistance in conducting the searches of electronic databases, Ms Linda Jenkins for her help with downloading and interpreting QOF reporting data, and Dr Mark Ashworth for his advice on interpreting the results.</p></ack><notes><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This study was funded by the Policy Research Unit in Commissioning and the Healthcare System, and by the Department of Health.

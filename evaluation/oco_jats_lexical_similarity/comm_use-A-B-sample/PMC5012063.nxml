The major mechanisms of wound healing differ between rodents and humans. In humans, wound healing primarily depends on re-epithelialization and granulation tissue (GT) formation, whereas wound contraction is more important during rodent wound closure. In this study, we described a novel excisional wound-splinting model in mice with a new biological membrane to imitate wound healing in humans. In this model, wound contraction can be effectually prevented, and the extent of re-epithelialization and the amount of granulation tissue can be determined easily. Furthermore, the harvested tissues can be analyzed with different methods according to the research aim. In conclusion, we have developed a biological membrane-based, novel, excisional wound-splinting model in mice that has unique advantages for wound healing research compared with the conventional animal model.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Key words</title><kwd>Animal model</kwd><kwd>biological membrane</kwd><kwd>re-epithelialization</kwd><kwd>wound healing</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Wound healing is a dynamic and coordinated process, and there are various animal models used to study wound healing. Incontestably, rodents are used for a wide range of research applications due to low cost and ease of breeding and genetic modifications. However, the major mechanisms of wound healing differ between the humans and rodents. In humans, the skin closely connects to the subcutaneous tissues. Thus, wound healing depends on re-epithelialization and granulation tissue (GT) formation. In rodents, contraction is the major process of wound healing, because their skin is mobile and contains panniculus carnosus, which is a thin sheet of striated muscle between the subcutaneous fat and dermal layer.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] Therefore, the rodent model does not precisely reflect human wound healing.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="2">Access this article online</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2">

Rodent models are not ideal because the major mechanism of wound healing in rodents is wound contraction, which is significantly different from that in humans.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] In our model, we used a biological membrane, which is an adhesive dressing and is commonly used for continuous negative pressure therapy for the deep wounds. The biological membrane can glue the skin stably for 10 days. With the biological membrane, skin contraction can be efficiently prevented. The wound will heal by re-epithelialization and GT formation, which reasonably reflects human process. Additionally, this model is easy to perform and low cost. Drugs, bioactive factors and cells can be applied to the wound bed or injected into the tissue directly to determine their effects on wound healing and provide new treatment. Furthermore, with this model, all the genetic modifications and disease models in mice can be used to study wound healing. Meanwhile, the tissue harvested in this model can be used with various methods according the research aims (for example, with FACS analysis of single-cell suspensions or western blot analysis).</p><p>Some new animal wound models are also being used to prevent wound contraction in other studies. The rabbit ear dermal ulcer model is widely used as a splinted model. The rabbit ear skin is attached to the underlying cartilage, which restricts wound contraction and forces wound healing to occur via new tissue formation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] This model is used to investigate mechanisms of hypertrophic scaring and wound healing.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] However, the disadvantage of this model is the high cost of breeding, and rabbits are hard to genetically modify. The cranial and tail excision models in rodents are other examples of anchored skin.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] However, the underlying soft connective tissue is lacking, and these models require complex surgery. The excisional wound-splinting model described in the present study is a novel wound healing model in mice using wound-splinting, which efficiently prevents skin contraction and forces the wound to heal through granulation and re-epithelialization. Galiano <italic>et al.</italic> found that the rate of re-epithelialization in splinted wounds is similar to unsplinted wounds, and the amount of GT deposition is increased compared to unsplinted wounds.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] Stem cells can be implanted into the wound bed to study cutaneous repair or regeneration using the mouse excisional, wound-splinting model.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] In this model, special frames prevent wound contraction. For example, silicone rubber, metal rings and polydimethylsiloxane devices, require microfabrication techniques, and some laboratories cannot afford these techniques. These devices also require complex surgeries to fix the rings in the skin, which may aggravate the wound.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] Chung <italic>et al.</italic> attached the Tegaderm HP dressing over the wound in diabetic and non-diabetic mice and found that the Tegaderm HP dressing retarded contraction in a large proportion of diabetic mice and, to a lesser extent, in non-diabetic mice.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]</p><p>Here we describe in detail every operational step. For example, we confirmed the wound point according to the different lines drawn on the back, which is very important for the stability of this model and is not referenced in other articles. In our previous study, we found that the animal&#x02019;s activities influence the position of the wound on the back. When the wound is on the top or middle of the back, the wound will be greatly influenced. In our study, the wound point placement is more constant and stable. Additionally, we propose more applications for this model. For example, drugs, bioactive factors and cells can be applied to the wound bed or injected into the tissue to determine their effects on wound healing, and the biological membrane could prevent the loss of drugs or cells.</p><p>In this study, we describe a new, excisional, wound-splinting model in mice to simulate human wound healing, which has some advantages compared to other animal models. We hope that this model can be used in more studies.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>These two authors contributed equally to this work.</p></fn><fn><p>

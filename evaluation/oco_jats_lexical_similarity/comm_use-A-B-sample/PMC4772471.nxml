Due to the poor self-healing capacity of articular cartilage and lack of specific diagnostic biomarkers, OA is a challenging disease with limited treatment options. Traditional pharmacologic therapies such as acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and opioids are effective in relieving pain but are incapable of reversing cartilage damage and are frequently associated with adverse events. Current research focuses on the development of new OA drugs (such as sprifermin/recombinant human fibroblast growth factor-18, tanezumab/monoclonal antibody against &#x003b2;-nerve growth factor), which aims for more effectiveness and less incidence of adverse effects than the traditional ones. Furthermore, regenerative therapies (such as autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), new generation of matrix-induced ACI, cell-free scaffolds, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells or iPSCs), and endogenous cell homing) are also emerging as promising alternatives as they have potential to enhance cartilage repair, and ultimately restore healthy tissue. However, despite currently available therapies and research advances, there remain unmet medical needs in the treatment of OA. This review highlights current research progress on pharmacologic and regenerative therapies for OA including key advances and potential limitations.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Osteoarthritis (OA), also known as degenerative joint disease, is characterized by cartilage degeneration and osseous overgrowth. OA is commonly encountered in today&#x02019;s clinical practice. The incidence of OA increases with age, and it is one of the most prevalent diseases in older people. In the USA alone, 10% of men and 13% of women aged 60 and older have been diagnosed with knee OA.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>
</sup> The symptoms of OA include joint pain, swelling, tenderness, stiffness, and sometimes locking, which may lead to disability and severely affect the life quality of patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>
</sup>
</p><p>Due to the lack of self-healing capacity of articular cartilage, OA is among the most challenging joint diseases and there is currently no cure for it. The focus of treatment for OA is to reduce pain and improve function of the affected joints.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>
</sup> Normally, applied pharmacologic therapy shows efficacy in pain relief but is frequently associated with adverse events.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>
</sup> In recent years, emerging regenerative therapy has gained much attention as it can efficiently promote tissue repair and regeneration.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>
</sup>
</p><p>This review mainly focuses on the current pharmacologic and regenerative therapeutic approaches for OA treatment. It includes therapy that has been confirmed clinically effective and used for decades, as well as therapy that shows promise in preclinical research and can potentially be translated for future clinical application, offering a systematic overview of progress in OA treatment in relation to progress with pharmacologic and regenerative therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Cartilage and OA</title><p>Articular cartilage is a typical hyaline cartilage that covers the ends of bones making up the joints in the body. It maintains smooth and frictionless movement, and dissipates stress in the joint. Articular cartilage is an avascular and aneural tissue; it consists primarily of chondrocytes and extracellular matrix including collagen type 2 and proteoglycans,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>
</sup> which transmit loads, stabilize the matrix, and maintain a healthy cartilage microenvironment. Due to its load-bearing function, cartilage is highly susceptible to damage during sports activities, and wear and tear over time. First proposed by Hunter in 1742,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>
</sup> it has long been recognized that cartilage defects cannot heal spontaneously. Researchers believe that the poor self-healing capacity is probably due to the poor blood supply and low metabolic activity in cartilage. If injured cartilage is not treated, it gets worse and affects surrounding tissue, and ultimately degenerates into OA.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>
</sup>
</p><p>Microscopically, OA cartilage is characterized by loss of collagen and proteoglycans,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>
</sup> thus perturbing the extracellular matrix structure and impairing the biomechanical properties.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>
</sup> Chondrocytes near the superficial layer form clusters, whereas in the deep and calcified layers, they undergo apoptotic death.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12 bib13 bib14">12&#x02013;14</xref>
</sup> Chondrocyte proliferation is somewhat activated, but cannot resist the predominant catabolic activity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>
</sup> During disease progression, OA chondrocytes produce matrix-degrading enzymes including matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13), which degrades collagen and A disintegrin, and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs-5 (Adamts-5), which targets aggrecan.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>
</sup> The synthesis of degradative enzymes further exacerbates the breakdown of articular cartilage. The biomechanical and biochemical changes would together disrupt cartilage homeostasis and contribute to the pathogenesis of OA, which leads to joint space narrowing, painful cartilage destruction, and loss of function.</p><p>In addition to cartilage degeneration, OA usually affects all structures in the synovial joint. Aberrant hypertrophy and calcification are reported in several OA cases, which is similar to the terminal differentiation process during endochondral ossification.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>
</sup> Osseous outgrowths called osteophytes often form at the joint margins.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>
</sup> Subchondral bone sclerosis,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>
</sup> meniscal tear and extrusion,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>
</sup> and synovial membrane inflammation (synovitis)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>
</sup> may also occur due to the mechanical changes in OA cartilage, and make OA disease more debilitating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Overview of OA treatment</title><p>According to the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) and the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS), the mainstay of OA treatments involves physical measures, drug therapy, and surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> Physical therapy is a simple, everyday adjunctive treatment. Weight loss can adjust the imbalanced mechanical stress, lessen joint pain, and reduce OA risks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25 bib26 bib27">25&#x02013;27</xref></sup> Moderate exercises help strengthen muscles and may delay the progression of OA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> Alternative treatments such as spa, massage, and acupuncture are also beneficial but lack enough evidence to support efficacy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> Surgery is only considered for severe cases when conservative therapy is ineffective because of the invasive trauma and higher risks. Arthroscopic irrigation and debridement provide a certain degree of pain relief but are not beneficial for long-term recovery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> Drilling and microfracture techniques aim at penetrating the subchondral plate to induce bone marrow stromal cells for spontaneous repair, but the repaired tissue is inferior and consists of less durable fibrocartilage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> Total joint replacement/arthroplasty is regarded as the best orthopaedic surgery for advanced OA. It can potentially reduce pain and improve joint function. Unfortunately, arthroplasty is not recommended for young patients, as the artificial implant has a finite lifespan (usually 10&#x02013;15 years). In addition, the long-term results of arthroplasty differ significantly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup>
</p><p>Pharmaceutical therapy is the most commonly used OA treatment option aimed mainly at pain relief and anti-inflammation. The traditional OA drugs are limited to control OA symptoms, but none can reverse the damage in the OA joint. And, the traditional drugs are always overwhelmed by its high incidence of adverse effects. Studies of new OA drugs (mainly biologic agents) with more effectiveness and fewer side effects are underway. In addition, regenerative therapy holds the possibility of repairing and regenerating damaged or lost tissues to restore the original structure and function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> It has already been applied in the orthopaedic clinic for several decades and promising outcomes have been achieved.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref></sup> In recent years, pilot clinical studies, although few, show the usefulness of regenerative therapy in the treatment of OA, suggesting its potential to be translated from bench to bedside.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40 bib41 bib42 bib43 bib44 bib45 bib46 bib47">40&#x02013;47</xref></sup> In the next sections, we would like to focus on the current pharmaceutical and regenerative therapies that have been clinically investigated, and that show safety and effectiveness in the management of OA.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacologic therapy</title><sec><title>Traditional OA drugs</title><p>There are mainly five kinds of medications commonly used in today&#x02019;s clinical treatment of OA: acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioid analgesics, serotonin&#x02013;norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and intra-articular injections. As there has been a considerable amount of literature focusing on the traditional drugs, here we provide a brief updated overview. The recommendations of the AAOS, American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and OARSI are summarized in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p><sec><title>Acetaminophen</title><p>Acetaminophen or paracetamol is an essential medicine as recognized by the World Health Organization, and is commonly used to reduce fever and relieve pains such as headache, muscle aches, backaches, and toothaches. Due to its relative safety and effectiveness, acetaminophen is recommended as the first-line oral analgesic for mild-to-moderate OA by most guidelines. According to ACR and OARSI guidelines, up to 4000&#x02009;mg per day is an effective initial treatment for mild-to-moderate knee or hip OA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref></sup> Overdosing acetaminophen may be toxic to the liver.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref></sup> Due to the risk of liver damage, on 13 January 2011, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) limited the amount of acetaminophen in prescription combination products to no &#x0003e;325&#x02009;mg per dosage unit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref></sup> Consistent with the change made by the FDA, the latest 2013 AAOS guideline downgraded the acetaminophen recommendation level to inconclusive and reduced the daily dosage from 4&#x02009;000 to 3&#x02009;000&#x02009;mg.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> For patients with severe symptoms or who do not respond to acetaminophen, more potent drugs should be considered, such as NSAIDs.</p></sec><sec><title>NSAIDs</title><p>NSAIDs provide anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects, and have long been used as an important remedy for moderate-to-severe OA. Acetaminophen is not regarded as an NSAID as it has little anti-inflammatory effect. Some studies adopted meta-analysis to compare the safety and efficacy between acetaminophen and NSAIDs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref></sup> By analyzing eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs), NSAIDs were better overall than acetaminophen in terms of pain relief. Although the efficacy of NSAIDs for OA treatment has been well documented, the health concerns, however, greatly restrict their extensive application. It is estimated that the occurrence of adverse effects is ~30% in people taking NSAIDs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref></sup> A total of 1%&#x02013;2% of people using NSAIDs develop gastrointestinal (GI) complications per year, which is much higher than that of people who do not use NSAIDs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref></sup> Although selective COX-2 inhibitors appeared safer than traditional NSAIDs, several commercial drugs have been placed under scrutiny or withdrawn by the FDA. The first approved COX-2 inhibitor Celecoxib (Celebrex, Pfizer, New York, NY, USA) received an FDA alert for the potential risk of serious adverse cardiovascular events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref></sup> Rofecoxib (Vioxx, Merck, Kenilworth, NJ, USA) and Valdecoxib (Bextra, Pfizer, New York, NY, USA) were withdrawn from the market for associated cardiovascular risks and other side effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">60</xref></sup> Therefore, there is a balance between the efficacy and safety of NSAIDs, and the benefit/risk ratio should be considered when taking these drugs. It is recommended by OARSI that NSAIDs be used at the minimum effective dose and prolonged use should be avoided as much as possible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup>
</p></sec><sec><title>Opioid analgesics</title><p>Opioids are used for the management of moderate-to-severe pain when NSAIDs and acetaminophen are ineffective or contraindicated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> There has been an increased use of opioids in OA treatment (31% opioid prescribed in 2003 to 40% in 2009),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">61</xref></sup> however, the frequent adverse effects associated with opioids, including nausea, vomiting, dizziness, constipation, sleepiness, tiredness, and headache, may outweigh the benefits in pain relief.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62 bib63 bib64">62&#x02013;64</xref></sup> Opioid abuse is another potential risk of using these drugs. Routine use should be avoided, and low effective and tolerated doses are recommended.</p></sec><sec><title>SNRIs</title><p>SNRIs are primarily used in the treatment of depression and other mood disorders. In 2010, the FDA approved duloxetine, a selective SNRI, for the management of chronic musculoskeletal pain including OA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">65</xref></sup> Duloxetine was considered an acceptable and favorable OA treatment based on the results from two double-blind, placebo-controlled RCTs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">67</xref></sup> It may be a promising and efficacious way to alleviate OA pain for patients who are unable to take other commonly used drugs. The FDA approval and ACR recommendation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref></sup> also confirm its value in clinical use. However, AAOS and OARSI have not included duloxetine in their OA management guidelines,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> as more large-scale longitudinal studies to further investigate the safety and efficacy for OA treatment have to be performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Intra-articular injections</title><p>Intra-articular injection of corticosteroids and hyaluronic acid are selectively used in the treatment of OA. Corticosteroid injection is recommended by OARIS for patients with moderate-to-severe pain who do not respond to oral analgesic and anti-inflammatory agents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> ACR and AAOS conditionally recommended corticosteroids for knee and/or for hip OA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref></sup> Hyaluronic acid is a component in both healthy and OA joint fluid. Intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid is recommended by OARIS as a treatment option for knee or hip OA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> However, the efficacy of hyaluronic acid injection varies. The 2013 edition of the AAOS guideline downgraded the recommendation on hyaluronic acid from an inconclusive level to a non-affirming level after excluding the evidence of lower strength.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup>
</p></sec></sec><sec><title>New OA drugs</title><p>The unsatisfactory effects and unacceptable side effects associated with traditional OA drugs warrant a continued search for potential new medications. Although few of them have received the regulatory approval for routine clinical use, a variety of new OA drugs have shown promising results in clinical trials (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). On the basis of the potential therapeutic targets, they can be classified as chondrogenesis inducers, osteogenesis inhibitors, matrix degradation inhibitors, apoptosis inhibitors, and anti-inflammatory cytokines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">68</xref></sup>

However, 68% of patients receiving tanezumab were recorded with adverse events. Sixteen subjects developed rapidly progressive OA and required total joint replacements, prompting the FDA to request the suspension of the trials of tanezumab. However, from subsequent assessments, the risk of rapidly progressive OA with tanezumab was lower than that with tanezumab/NSAID combination therapy, and the rate of joint replacement was comparable between tanezumab monotherapy and placebo treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">75</xref></sup> Therefore, the FDA has agreed to continue the clinical trials of tanezumab in OA treatment in conjunction with appropriate safety monitoring.</p></sec><sec><title>Fibroblast growth factor</title><p>The ideal biologic agents for OA treatment should alleviate pain, relieve symptoms and restore the normal structure of the joint.

Currently, cell therapy is applicable to both mature cells and stem cells.</p><sec><title>Chondrocytes</title><p>First described by Brittberg <italic>et al.</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">90</xref></sup> autologous chondrocyte implantation/transplantation (ACI/ACT) is widely used in clinical practice and more than 15&#x02009;000 patients have received this treatment worldwide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">91</xref></sup> ACI mainly includes three key steps.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">89</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">92</xref></sup> First, a small mass of cartilage tissue (~150&#x02013;300&#x02009;mg) is collected from a healthy and less weight-bearing area during an arthroscopic biopsy procedure. Then, the extracellular matrix is enzymatically removed, and chondrocytes are isolated and cultured <italic>in vitro</italic> to acquire enough cells to reimplant. Finally, chondrocytes are implanted into the damaged area of the articular cartilage in a second open-knee procedure. On the basis of the various implantation methods, three generations of ACI have been developed in the past 20 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">92</xref></sup> The first generation adopts a piece of periosteum sutured over the prepared defect which is taken from the patient&#x02019;s tibia. Then, the chondrocyte suspension is injected under the periosteum, where it forms a bioreactive chamber to allow cell growth and maturation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">90</xref></sup> The limitations of the first generation lie in the periosteal delamination and hypertrophy, which lead to the development of the second generation of ACI using a bilayer collagen membrane. This biomaterial-based membrane is also sutured over the defect and followed by cell suspension injected underneath. The advance in tissue engineering contributes tangibly to the third generation. Cultured chondrocytes are pre-seeded on a three-dimensional scaffold and trimmed to fit the defect size. The &#x02018;all-in-one&#x02019; composite is then implanted to the defect area with the fixation of fibrin glue. No periosteum or sutures are used in this method. Therefore, the third generation of ACI is also called matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation/transplantation (MACI/MACT). MACI shows evident benefits over classic ACI as it reduces the surgical time, minimizes the fixation invasion and ensures even and long-term cell maintenance. More details about the scaffolds used in MACI will be discussed in the section &#x02018;tissue engineering&#x02019;.</p><p>The clinical outcomes of ACI have been well documented in full-thickness and osteochondral defect repair. In 1994, Brittberg <italic>et al.</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">90</xref></sup> first performed classic ACI in 23 patients with full-thickness cartilage defects. Eighty-eight percent of patients with femoral condylar defects showed good or excellent results after 2-year transplantation, but only 28.6% of patients with patella injuries had a satisfying outcome at the 3-year time point. Postoperative arthroscopy revealed 11 out of the 15 biopsies showing hyaline-like cartilage. Long-term follow-ups were subsequently reported by the same group for up to 10 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">93</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">94</xref></sup> Treatment for isolated femoral condyle defects and osteochondritis dissecans achieved ~90% good to excellent results. In addition, groups of patients with multiple and patella lesions demonstrated &#x0003e;65% good outcomes. Adverse effects were reported in 52 out of 101 patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">94</xref></sup> The most common complications were periosteal hypertrophy (26 patients) and intraarticular adhesions (10 patients). Overall, ACI can be regarded as a reasonable treatment for deep cartilage defects.</p><p>The commercial product Carticel (autologous cultured chondrocyte, manufacturer: Genzyme Biosurgery, Cambridge, MA, USA) was initially approved by the FDA in 1997 for the repair of symptomatic cartilage defects of the femoral condyle caused by acute or repetitive trauma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">95</xref></sup> However, cartilage damage with generalized OA was an exclusion criterion for treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">96</xref></sup> This is because ACI is applicable to localized cartilage defects surrounded by healthy cartilage. OA cartilage, however, often affects the adjacent areas and disturbs the homeostasis of the whole joint cavity. In this degenerative microenvironment, the implanted chondrocytes may undergo undesired dedifferentiation or apoptosis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">97</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">98</xref></sup> therefore undermining efficacy. In recent years, two trials tested the first-generation ACI for the more challenging OA disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">99</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">100</xref></sup> Minas <italic>et al.</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">100</xref></sup> performed classic ACI on 153 patients with early OA changes with a mean age of 37.3 and average defect size of 4.9&#x02009;cm<sup>2</sup>. At an average 5-year follow-up, treatment failure occurred in 12 knees that changed to joint arthroplasty. Among the patients considered without treatment failures, 92% experienced functional improvements, especially in the WOMAC pain and function scores. They concluded that ACI provided a plausible treatment for young OA patients and delayed the need for knee arthroplasty. Rosenberger <italic>et al.</italic> reported a case series of 56 patients older than 45 years, among which 32 patients were diagnosed with early degenerative changes (mean defect size 11.7&#x02009;cm<sup>2</sup>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">99</xref></sup> At the latest available follow-up, 72% of patients of all defect categories and 81% of OA patients experienced good or excellent clinical improvements. Three out of 32 OA patients were considered treatment failures. Their favorable findings pointed to consider classic ACI as a therapy for older age groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Mesenchymal stem cells</title><p>Although no severe clinical safety issues have been associated with the ACI technique, there are still some problems including the limited cells available, multiple surgical procedures involved, <italic>in vitro</italic> chondrocyte dedifferentiation, and donor-site morbidity caused by cartilage harvest.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">101</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">102</xref></sup> Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are considered a potential cell source since they can be easily collected from various tissues such as bone marrow, adipose tissue, synovial membrane, and others, and have a high proliferation rate, chondro-differentiation capacity, and immunosuppressive activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103 bib104 bib105">103&#x02013;105</xref></sup>
</p><p>Bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) are the most attractive stem cells in regenerative medicine studies, and attempts have been made to use them for OA treatment. In 2011, Davatchi <italic>et al.</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> published a preliminary report of four patients with moderate-to-severe knee OA. Autologous BM-MSCs were cultured for 4&#x02013;5 weeks, and 8&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup>&#x02013;9&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> cells were injected into the knee joint. After 1-year follow-up, pain produced during walking was reduced in three patients. The number of stairs to climb to produce pain and pain on a VAS were improved in all four patients. As the physical parameters improved slightly, the results were encouraging, but not ideal. In another trail, Orozco <italic>et al.</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup> performed MSC therapy on 12 patients diagnosed with Kellgren and Lawrence grades II to IV knee OA. More BM-MSCs (40&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup>) were intra-articularly injected. One-year follow-up indicated marked increase in VAS (69%), Lequesne (65%), and WOMAC (78%) pain indices. Cartilage quality was significantly improved in 11 of 12 patients as evidenced by T2 mapping quantification.</p><p>Choi&#x02019;s group tried to use adipose tissue-derived MSCs (AD-MSCs) to treat OA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">106</xref></sup> They proposed that AD-MSCs had an advantage over BM-MSCs as obtaining cells from bone marrow is difficult and painful, together with risks of complications. They collected the cells from the infrapatellar fat pad and prepared these with PRP. Twenty-five patients with knee OA received this intra-articular injection. It yielded improved clinical outcomes on the 1-year follow-up as shown by the Lysholm, Tegner activity scale, and VAS scores; but no significant difference was detected between the MSC-treated group and the control group, which consisted of injections of PRP alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">106</xref></sup> On 2-year follow-up to their previous study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> WOMAC, Lysholm, and VAS pain scores were as well significantly improved when compared with the preoperative status. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination further confirmed the improvement in cartilage. However, no comparison between the treatment and control groups was shown. Thus, one cannot distinguish the effect of AD-MSCs from that of PRP and accurately investigate the efficacy of AD-MSCs on OA treatment.</p><p>Overall, the preliminary results demonstrated that MSC-based therapy is encouraging in reducing pain and improving the function of OA. More RCTs with a large number of patients and long-term follow-up are needed before full-scale clinical translation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Tissue engineering</title><p>Tissue engineering involves the use of cells, scaffolds, and bioactive factors to enhance tissue mechanical properties and promote cell migration, attachment, proliferation, and differentiation to the desired cell type. Tissue engineering therapy has shown a lot of promising outcomes in the treatment of cartilage defects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">107</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">108</xref></sup> For OA treatment, only a few results have been reported, though there is hope for the future.</p><sec><title>Cell-based scaffolds</title><p>Treatment with cell-based scaffolds involves tissue harvest and cell expansion procedures that are used in ACI or other forms of cell therapy. The cells are pre-seeded on the scaffold, and the composite is subsequently implanted into the defect area with or without fixation. The third-generation ACI (MACI) is one of the most extensively used techniques for the clinical treatment of cartilage defects. Many commercial products have been approved for scaffold-associated chondrocyte implantation for more than a decade in Europe and Australia, such as Chondro-Gide (a bilayer collagen type 1/3 scaffold, manufactured by Geistlich Biomaterials, Wolhusen, Switzerland), Hyaff-11 (a hyaluronan-based scaffold, manufactured by Fida Advanced Biopolymers, Abano Terme, Italy), and BioSeed-C (a synthetic polymer scaffold composed of fibrin, polyglycolic/polylactic acid, and polydioxanone, manufactured by BioTissue, Z&#x000fc;rich, Switzerland). In a case series published by Bauer <italic>et al.</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></sup> 18 young patients suffering from medial knee OA (mean age 47 years) underwent high tibial osteotomy (HTO) combined with MACI using a collagen membrane scaffold (ACI-Maix Matricel GmbH, Herzogenrath, Germany). At the 5-year follow-up, the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) was significantly improved. MRI results were improved at 24 and 48 months, but declined at the end point with only 33% good quality infill. No major complications but minor complications were found including patellar tendinitis. In another clinical trial, 79 patients with posttraumatic and focal OA cartilage defects were treated with autologous chondrocyte-seeded BioSeed-C scaffold. Clinical assessment was performed in 40 patients with 2-year follow-ups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> The evaluated scores including International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, the Lysholm score, the Cincinnati knee score, and KOOS were all statistically significantly improved compared with preoperative values. Histological results showed good integration of the graft and newly formed cartilaginous tissue. In their subsequent 4-year follow-up with 19 patients of the cohort,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref></sup> the Lysholm score, IKDC score, and KOOS were further improved. MRI analysis revealed that 16 out of 19 patients experienced moderate to complete filling of the defects. These results showed that BioSeed-C is a potential therapeutic option for degenerative defects with stable effect. Although MACI technique has been reported with promising results for OA treatment in many trails, researchers demonstrated that MACI with Hyaff-11 scaffold was questionable for knee OA due to the poor performance and high failure rate. They treated 44 patients using MACI as a salvage procedure. After a 9-year mean follow-up, 27.3% treatment was considered to have failed. Almost half (47.7%) of the patients considered their condition unimproved and 39% would not choose this treatment again despite the significant improvement of IKDC and EQ-VAS scores. This long-term follow-up study indicated that the tissue-engineered cartilage implantation should be fully investigated before its application as a salvage procedure for the treatment of OA.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell-free scaffolds</title><p>Cell-free scaffolds are developed for one-stage procedure techniques, which can be either implanted alone to attract the endogenous cells or combined with biological products such as concentrated bone marrow or PRP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">98</xref></sup> As exogenous cell transplantation is not required, it avoids the issues around the <italic>in vitro</italic> cell culture process, such as slow growth and aberrant differentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">102</xref></sup> Clinical results of cell-free scaffolds on OA treatment are few. A case report documented a 46-year-old athletic patient with International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) grade IV degenerative chondral lesions treated with a three-layer nanostructured biomimetic scaffold (manufactured by Fin-Ceramica, Faenza, Italy) together with HTO.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref></sup> At 1-year follow-up, the patient was pain-free and returned to a satisfactory functional level. MRI analysis showed hyaline-like articular cartilage and non-visible subchondral oedema. An Italian group reported clinical improvements using PRP-enriched polyglycolic acid (PGA)-hyaluronan scaffold (chondrotissue, manufactured by BioTissue AG, Z&#x000fc;rich, Switzerland).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref></sup> Fifty-two patients suffering degenerative chondral defects were treated, among which, 47 patients had grade I&#x02013;III OA. The KOOS score was significantly increased, and histological staining revealed hyaline-like cartilage repair tissue at 1-year follow-up. The above two pilot studies confirmed the usefulness of cell-free scaffolds. However, an <italic>in vivo</italic> study using sheep OA model demonstrated that cell-free approaches were inferior to MACI by macroscopic and histological examinations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">109</xref></sup> It remains to be seen whether cell-free scaffolds have more advantages over cell-seeded scaffolds in human studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Gene therapy</title><p>Gene therapy enables the spatiotemporal control and persistent synthesis of gene products at target sites. Several preclinical studies have confirmed its safety and efficacy, and implicated its prospects, but few clinical trials have been conducted and no gene products have been approved for OA treatment.

The traditional OA drugs are effective in reducing pain and inflammation but insufficient to slow, stop, or reverse the joint damage, and are frequently associated with adverse effects. New OA drugs such as biologic agents and chemotherapeutic drugs show more marked effects and fewer side effects, and look more promising than traditional OA drugs. Regenerative therapy is a novel strategy that has the potential to restore normal structure and function of damaged cartilage. At present, clinical studies in regenerative therapy are in its infancy with relatively rare and low-level evidence of success. Larger, random, controlled, and long-term follow-up studies are expected to take place in the coming years to confirm its safety and effectiveness. Although current pharmacologic and regenerative therapy show great promises, limitations still exist. Potential therapies may be developed by exploring more therapeutic targets and methods.

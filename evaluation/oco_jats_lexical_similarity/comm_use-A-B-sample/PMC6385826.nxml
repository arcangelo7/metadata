developing countries. Now, I would like to discuss a little about the Heart Team in
Brazil.</p><p>The Heart Team is a class I indication as the best approach for cardiac patients. The
Heart Team has brought more patients to be treated by the surgical groups and,
therefore, doesn't get much resistance from the surgeons. I see, even today, a great
difficulty in having discussions in true Heart Teams. Oftentimes there are discussions
from which surgeons are excluded. However, many colleagues, both clinical and
hemodynamicist, argue that the group is a way to withdraw the autonomy of those doctors.
The physician should be the moderating power; they play a key role in the Heart Team and
therefore must be well prepared and have a strong scientific spirit. They cannot be
biased and for this they must believe that the Heart Team should be called on even when
their opinion is contradicted. There is no adequate Heart Team where there is vanity and
little openness to the discussion. As physicians, we are people who habitually get used
to overcoming personal challenges, we study continuously, but we find it difficult to be
confronted, even with scientific arguments. To be effective in the treatment of our
patients, we must, first of all, be humble. This is why we have two ears and one mouth:
we need to listen more and only say as a part of three parts that form the Heart Team.
We need to reprogram our minds to this new reality where knowledge is not restricted to
our personal islands. A man is not an island.</p></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCE</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Yadava</surname><given-names>OP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Heart Team - The Reality?</article-title><source>Braz J Cardiovasc Surg</source><year>2018</year><volume>33</volume><issue>6</issue><fpage>III</fpage><lpage>IIV</lpage></element-citation></ref></ref-list></back></article>

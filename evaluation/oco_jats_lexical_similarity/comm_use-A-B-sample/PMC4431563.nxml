In February, more than 50 cases were reported in several locations, including infections acquired in health facilities in Riyadh and Damman City.</p><p>A team of experts from the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nation&#x02019;s Food and Agriculture Organization, the World Organization for Animal Health and the Pasteur Institute in France visited Saudi Arabia to assess the situation and to make recommendations for improving surveillance and control, and for preventing infection with MERS coronavirus (CoV).</p><p>Members of the joint mission held discussions with representatives from the ministry of health, visited the centre that is responsible for MERS-CoV control efforts, and toured the emergency and isolation facilities of the Prince Mohammed Bin Abdulaziz Hospital.</p><p>Government officials and members of the WHO-led mission shared their concerns about the rising number of MERS-CoV cases in recent weeks and, in particular, in health-care facilities.</p><p>WHO and the Saudi Arabian health authorities identified several key areas for urgent attention. A better understanding of the modes of infection and transmission between animals and humans is needed as well as more research studies &#x02013; the findings of which should be shared widely and promptly. Efforts are also needed to improve infection control, especially in health facilities, while social mobilization, community engagement and communications should be stepped up to raise more awareness about how to prevent the disease.</p><p>MERS-CoV is a viral respiratory disease caused by a coronavirus that was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. MERS-CoV cases continue to occur, with sporadic cases and clusters of cases in communities and health-care settings. There is still no evidence of sustained human to human transmission.</p><p>In total since the emergence of the virus in April 2012, 1059 laboratory&#x02013;confirmed cases of MERS-CoV, including at least 394 deaths have been reported to WHO, as of 11 March. More than 85% of these have been reported from Saudi Arabia.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/csr/don/11-march-2015-mers-saudi-arabia">http://www.who.int/csr/don/11-march-2015-mers-saudi-arabia</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>After cyclone Pam</title><p>The WHO office for the Western Pacific Region has been coordinating response efforts with Vanuatu's Ministry of Health and other humanitarian partners to bring health support to the Pacific island country following the devastation caused by cyclone Pam.</p><p>The category five cyclone ravaged the Pacific island of Vanuatu on 13 and 14 March, with winds of more than 250 km/h and massive storm surges.</p><p>As of 16 March, there were reports of deaths and serious injuries, and that as many as 90% of homes had been severely damaged or destroyed with limited or no access to health services, food and clean water in many parts of the island.</p><p>&#x0201c;We are working closely with our partners to get the people of Vanuatu what they need as quickly as possible,&#x0201d; said Dr Shin Young-soo, WHO Regional Director for the Western Pacific. &#x0201c;We have activated our emergency operations centre and put a support team in place to assess needs and deploy critical resources to help in the response.&#x0201d;</p><p>WHO has sent in health and emergency response experts with supplies to Vanuatu to assist in the response and is working with the governments of Australia and New Zealand, as well as the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and other organizations.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wpro.who.int/mediacentre/releases/2015/20150316">http://www.wpro.who.int/mediacentre/releases/2015/20150316</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>Medical supplies for Ukraine</title><p>Several tonnes of medical aid procured by WHO reached Donetsk in eastern Ukraine at the end of February, as part of a United Nations convoy. WHO's contribution consisted of medical products for HIV.</p><p>The medical kits will provide treatment for more than 38 000 people with HIV in Donetsk and Luhansk.</p><p>&#x0201c;Health care and health services are under immense strain in Ukraine's conflict-affected areas,&#x0201d; said Dr Dorit Nitzan Kaluski, WHO Representative in Ukraine.</p><p>Access to care is limited because some health facilities have been destroyed, there is a shortage of medical supplies while health professionals in the affected areas have not received their salaries and patients are unable to pay for health care themselves.</p><p>Among the estimated 5 million civilians affected by the crisis in Ukraine, those living in combat zones are particularly vulnerable, as they have limited access to humanitarian assistance. The interagency convoy is only one of the many initiatives of the United Nations and its humanitarian partners to provide relief aid to those in need.</p><p>Along with other humanitarian organizations operating in Ukraine, the United Nations Refugee Agency, UNICEF and WHO are concerned about the absence of secure humanitarian access to deliver aid to children and families affected by the conflict across the country.</p><p>Since March 2014, more than 1 million people have been displaced within Ukraine, including more than 134 000 children.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.euro.who.int/en/countries/ukraine/news/news/2015/02/medical-supplies-from-who-reach-ukraine-as-part-of-united-nations-aid-convoy">http://www.euro.who.int/en/countries/ukraine/news/news/2015/02/medical-supplies-from-who-reach-ukraine-as-part-of-united-nations-aid-convoy</ext-link></p><boxed-text id="Bb" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Cover photo</title></caption><p>Cattle forage for vegetables in India.

The guidelines provide advice on how to prioritize care for patients with cirrhosis, the most advanced stage of liver disease.</p><p>The guidelines recommend treatment for chronic hepatitis B with tenofovir or entecavir, two medicines which are available in many countries as generics, costing as little as US$ 5 per person per month.</p><p>Worldwide, an estimated 240 million people have chronic hepatitis B virus &#x02013; a viral infection spread through the blood and body fluids that results in an estimated 650&#x02009;000 deaths each year.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/hiv/pub/hepatitis/hepatitis-b-guidelines">http://www.who.int/hiv/pub/hepatitis/hepatitis-b-guidelines</ext-link></p><boxed-text id="Bc" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Looking ahead</title></caption><list list-type="simple" id="L1"><list-item><p><bold>7 April &#x02013; World Health Day.</bold> This year&#x02019;s theme is food safety. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/campaigns/world-health-day/2015/event">http://www.who.int/campaigns/world-health-day/2015/event</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>18&#x02013;26 May &#x02013; World Health Assembly.</bold>

It is generally acknowledged that sexuality is an important component of QoL; however, rehabilitation services frequently fall short of including sexuality as a matter of routine. The literature was reviewed to examine the experiences of trauma survivors from three groups: spinal cord injury (SCI), traumatic brain injury (TBI) and burns. The focus was on the impact of trauma on the QoL to identify future research directions and to advocate for the inclusion of sexuality as an integral part of rehabilitation. Databases searched were Proquest, Ovid, Cinahl, Medline, PsycInfo and Cochrane Central Register of controlled trials. A total of 36 eligible studies were included: SCI (<italic>n</italic> = 25), TBI (<italic>n</italic> = 6), burns (<italic>n</italic> = 5). Four themes were identified across the three trauma groups that were labeled as physiological impact of trauma on sexuality, cognitive-genital dissociation (CGD), sexual disenfranchisement (SD) and sexual rediscovery (SR). Trauma injury has a significant impact on sexuality, which is not routinely addressed within rehabilitation services. Further sexuality research is required among all trauma groups to improve rehabilitation services and in turn QoL outcomes for all trauma survivors.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Key words</title><kwd>Burns</kwd><kwd>rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>spinal cord injury</kwd><kwd>sexuality</kwd><kwd>traumatic brain injury</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Improved rate of survival post-trauma has precipitated a shift from outcomes measured in terms of mortality to outcomes being measured in terms of activities of daily living (ADLs) and quality of life (QoL).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]</p><p>Sexuality is a component of many of the QoL domains; however, current QoL measures do not adequately incorporate sexuality within their assessment components, thus perpetuate the exclusion of sexuality as a matter of discourse within trauma rehabilitation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]<table-wrap id="TabA"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="2">Access this article online</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2">

Phelps <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] study of married or partnered men with a spinal cord injury (SCI) suggested that while 96% of participants were sexually active, 20% reported little to no sexual desire and 44% reported dissatisfaction or indifference with their sexual relationship. Mendes <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] in their study of sexual satisfaction in men with SCI found that 60% of their participants were satisfied with their sexual lives. However, their findings did indicate that there was a significant fall in sexual satisfaction following SCI with 80% (32 males) in the prelesion period of the study reporting to be very satisfied with this dropping to 47.5% (19 males) in the postlesion study period. There has been little empirical research conducted regarding female sexuality following SCI. Kettl <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] study of female sexuality following SCI found that 26% of participants rated sex as less important following injury and 23% were less satisfied with their sexual lives. Most significantly, this study found that the majority of women experienced body image changes with 52% reporting that their bodies were less attractive than they were before their SCI. The authors suggest that these body image changes may play a role in both the reduction of sexual activity and enjoyment found in the study.</p><p>Changes to sexual functioning have also been documented following brain injury. In Kreuter <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] study of males and females post-traumatic brain injury (TBI), 56% of the participants (<italic>n</italic> = 92) reported dissatisfaction with the frequency of sexual activity with 31% identifying a lack of intimate partner being the main contributing factor. In contrast, 86% of the respondents who had an intimate partner were satisfied with their sexual lives and 75% were satisfied with the frequency of intercourse. Ponsford[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] study also supported these findings with 54% of participants (<italic>n</italic> = 280) reporting a decrease in sexual frequency. In addition, 41% expressed a decrease in sexual drive, 39% felt the ability to satisfy their partner had decreased, 38% had a decreased ability to engage in sexual intercourse, and 38% reported less enjoyment in sexual activity. The author concluded that more than 50% of people following a TBI experience significant sexual changes up to 5 years post-injury.</p><p>There has been very little research regarding sexuality following burn injuries, thus research involving adequate methods and sample sizes are scarce. Evidence from a western Australian burn unit sample suggests that burn injuries have a significant impact on sexuality and body image satisfaction and that these changes are potentially long standing. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] Our preliminary data analysis of responses from the Burns Specific Health Scale-Brief suggests that over 20% of burn survivors (<italic>n</italic> = 362) report a loss of sexual interest up to 12 months post-injury.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] Body image dissatisfaction is high among burn survivors with over 40% indicating the perception that they are unattractive to others and 40% indicating that their scars bother them.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] A significant finding was that the severity of the responses, as scored via a Likert scale, was much higher in females especially for the body image domains.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] We concluded that sexuality and body image may have a role in post-burn psychosocial adjustment and QoL that requires further research.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]</p><p>Sexuality is a dynamic entity in which the interplay of biological, psychological, sociological, spiritual and cultural factors influence personality development sense of self-esteem and ability to form interpersonal relationships.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] In order to conceptualize the dynamics involved, the World Health Organization&#x02019;s (WHO) (2002) working definition of sexuality[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] will be used as a frame of reference when using the term sexuality throughout this review.</p><p>The research question guiding this literature review was as follows: What are the experiences of adult trauma survivors regarding how changes in their sexuality impact their QoL?

These labels were used as they were relevant to understanding the psychosocial components of the body of literature reviewed in relation to sexuality post-burn, TBI and SCI trauma groups, as opposed to SCI alone. In addition to these 3 themes, a fourth theme emerged regarding the physiological impact of trauma on sexuality, and thus is also included in this review.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Publication titles and abstracts were reviewed online.

These principles are 1) the adoption of a patient-centered framework, with emphasis on cultural competence in medical practice (taking into account biopsychosocial factors in accordance with the WHO&#x02019;s definitions of health)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], 2) application of evidence-based medicine in diagnostic and treatment planning (assessment and treatment should be guided by best evidence-based research and practice), and 3) use of a unified management approach in evaluating and treating sexual problems in both men and women (this is described as incorporating the need for gender equality in sexual medicine, although the authors of this review suggest this should include further expansion of concepts of gender and diverse sexual orientations). While these guidelines have been described in terms of sexual medicine, it provides a potential framework for working with sexuality changes that can be adapted to the multidisciplinary healthcare setting.</p><p>Hatzichristou <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] classify sexual dysfunctions as 1) psychogenic (the absence of biological findings, 2) organic (biological findings, although not significant mental/cognitive or emotional/affect distress), and 3) mixed (biological findings with significant mental/cognitive or emotional/affect distress). The authors stress that organic and psychogenic factors are often both present, particularly for those with long-standing sexual function problems. An alternative classification of sexual dysfunction following trauma or chronic illness, i.e. potentially better suited for a multidisciplinary clinical context, is that described by Foley and Gimbel.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] They describe 3 levels of sexual changes for people with multiple sclerosis&#x02014;primary, secondary, and tertiary&#x02014;although it is our belief that these levels of sexual changes could apply to all trauma and chronic illness groups. Primary sexual changes relate to nervous system damage that impairs physiological aspects of sexual response, e.g. decreases in sexual desire, painful or unpleasant genital sensations, and changes to frequency and/or intensity of orgasmic response. Secondary changes relate to other symptoms and/or physical limitations that indirectly impact sexual response, e.g. difficulties with bowel and bladder continence during sexual activity, fatigue and muscle weakness limiting body positioning. Lastly, tertiary sexuality changes result from psychosocial and cultural issues that can have a negative impact on sexual esteem, body image and sexual satisfaction, e.g. changes in roles, lifestyle, and participation in social, work, or leisure activities. Tertiary sexual changes may also be linked with greater rates of depression, decreased self-esteem and decreased body image for people with disabilities[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]</p><p>While any classification system of health-related issues should be utilized with caution and/or care, they do provide a potential framework in which the combination of biopsychosocial issues can be factored into screening within the clinical setting for assessment and treatment planning. Unfortunately, there were no individual or multicenter clinical trials of screening or assessment tools of sexuality changes for use by health professionals in any of the trauma group literature included in this review. This finding highlights a significant gap in evidence-based knowledge and practice for all trauma diagnostic groups that require further attention with empirical research.</p><p>Of the 36 eligible articles included in this review, only 3 included a validated sexuality-related outcome measure. The 3 measures that were included within the literature reviewed were all designed primarily for research use and are potentially not suited for the multidisciplinary clinical setting.

The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) developed by Rosen <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] was designed as a brief, valid, and reliable self-reported measure for use as clinical trials assessment instrument.

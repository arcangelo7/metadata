sternotomy avoids the cardiopulmonary bypass, however, lacks the cosmetic
advantage. Perventricular device closure of ventricular septal defect with
transverse split sternotomy was performed to add the cosmetic advantage of
mini-invasive technique.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Thirty-six pediatric patients with mean age 7.14&#x000b1;3.24 months and
weight 5.00&#x000b1;0.88 kg were operated for perventricular device closure
of ventricular septal defect through transverse split sternotomy in
4<sup>th</sup> intercostal space under transesophageal echocardiography
guidance. In case of failure or complication, surgical closure of
ventricular septal defect was performed through the same incision with
cervical cannulation of common carotid artery and internal jugular vein for
commencement of cardiopulmonary bypass. All the patients were
postoperatively followed, and then discharged from hospital due to their
surgical outcome, morbidity and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Procedure was successful in 35 patients. Two patients developed transient
heart block. Surgical closure of ventricular septal defect was required in
one patient. Mean duration of ventilation was 11.83&#x000b1;3.63 hours. Mean
intensive care unit and hospital stay were 1.88&#x000b1;0.74 days and
6.58&#x000b1;1.38 days, respectively. There was no in-hospital mortality. A
patient died one day after hospital discharge due to arrhythmia. No patients
developed wound related, vascular or neurological complication. In a mean
follow-up period of 23.3&#x000b1;18.45 months, all 35 patients were doing
well without residual defect with regression of pulmonary artery
hypertension as seen on transthoracic echocardiography.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Transverse split sternotomy incision is a safe and effective alternative to a
median sternotomy for perventricular device closure of ventricular septal
defect with combined advantage of better cosmetic outcomes and avoidance of
cardiopulmonary bypass.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Prosthesis Implantation</kwd><kwd>Heart Septal Defects, Ventricular</kwd><kwd>Cardiopulmonary Bypass</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><table-wrap id="t3" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="20%" span="1"/><col width="20%" span="1"/><col width="20%" span="1"/><col width="20%" span="1"/><col width="20%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" style="background-color:#e6e7e8" rowspan="1">Abbreviations,

in low weight infants is technically challenging and associated with high rate of
morbidity and mortality<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Percutaneous device closure is not
feasible in these patients, due to technical limitations and high rate of
complications. Therefore, hybrid procedure with perventricular device closure is an
effective and safe alternative management strategy<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. Hybrid approach is beneficial in avoiding CPB,
radiation and complications of vascular access. In addition, there is less need for
homologous blood transfusion, 'fast-tracking' - early extubation, mobilization, and
hospital discharge<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. Perventricular device closure of
VSD using transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) guidance on beating euvolemic heart
in operating room is a hybrid procedure which offers similar advantages of avoiding
ventricular incisions, division of right ventricle (RV) muscle bundles especially
moderator band, and immediate confirmation of adequate closure as conventional
technique. This technique is safe, particularly in low weight babies, who are
high-risk candidates for the procedure in catheterization laboratory<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Perventricular technique, thus, significantly reduces the operative trauma to the
patient. However, it is unable to prevent physical and psychological trauma
associated with long skin incision and midline sternotomy. Moreover, the use of this
technique in case of associated malnutrition, failure to thrive and congestive
cardiac failure; a high risk of developing wound infection, mediastinitis, sternal
dehiscence, and carinatum deformity can be observed<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>At our institute, perventricular device closure of VSD using mini-invasive transverse
split sternotomy was performed. If patient required surgical closure of VSD, CPB was
instituted through cervical cannulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>This study was carried out between January 2013 to December 2015. Infants with single
or predominant, moderate to large muscular or perimembranous VSD with left to right
shunt were included in the study. Inclusion criteria's were persistent congestive
heart failure despite optimal medical therapy and body weight &#x0003c;10 kg. Patients
with any major debilitating illness or additional multiple apical VSDs, who may have
required concomitant pulmonary artery banding and patients with associated other
cardiac lesions except patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) which required concomitant
surgical repair on CPB were excluded. The study was approved by our Institutional
Ethics Committee. Parents or guardian were explained in detail about the procedure
and informed consent was obtained.</p><p>In all the patients, preoperative transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was performed
under sedation to confirm the diagnosis, to assess the size, site and number of
VSDs, pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH), ventricular function, suitability of VSD
for device closure and to rule out other cardiac lesions.</p><sec><title>Anaesthesia and monitoring</title><p>All the infants were operated under general anaesthesia and continuous TEE
guidance. Routine invasive hemodynamic monitoring was used in patients requiring
VSD closure on CPB, bilateral regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) was
measured using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) (INVOS 5100B, Somanetics, Inc.,
Troy, MI, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Perventricular Device Closure of VSD</title><sec><title>Access and Surgical Procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure

</p><p>Patients were positioned in supine position with bolster under the scapula,
head rest under the head with head turned to the left. Right femoral vein
catheterized for central venous access. Draping was done to keep the base of
neck, whole of the chest laterally up to posterior axillary line on right
side and nipple on the left side exposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). A transverse skin incision was performed in the
4<sup>th</sup> intercostal space over the whole width of the sternum and
incision deepened to periosteal level. Transverse sternotomy was performed
at the same level sparing both internal mammary arteries. Sternotomy was
performed at an angle of 45&#x000b0; for better osteo-synthesis and reduced sternal
mobility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>). Sternal ends were
retracted with a small retractor. Thymic gland was divided. Pericardium was
opened vertically and pericardial stays were placed.</p><p>Under continuous TEE guidance, optimal site for right ventricular puncture
was chosen by gentle indentation of RV free wall using finger or
forceps-held cotton gauze. Puncture site was considered optimal, if it was
away from the papillary muscle and remained at an adequate distance from the
septum so as to allow perpendicular access to VSD. A purse string suture was
placed on RV free wall at proposed site of puncture with pledgeted 5-0
polypropylene suture. Systemic heparinization was performed with 100 U/kg of
unfractionated heparin. A 20G arterial cannula with stylet was introduced
into RV, perpendicular to the VSD and stylet was removed. A 0.025-inch
straight-tipped guide wire (Terumo Corporation: Tokyo, Japan) was introduced
through the cannula and maneuvered across the VSD into the LV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>). The cannula was exchanged
with gradually enlarging sheath from 5F to finally 8 or 10F (Cordis
Corporation; Miami, FL, USA) over 0.038 inch angled guide wire (Cordis
Corporation; Miami, FL, USA). Sheath was positioned across VSD with its tip
in left ventricular (LV) cavity. Device was advanced into the sheath and
deployed under continuous TEE guidance. Imaging in multiple planes was
undertaken to confirm appropriate device placement and assess residual shunt
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>). In addition, any new
tricuspid, mitral or aortic valvular obstruction or regurgitation was also
looked for. The wires and sheath were removed and the purse string was
tied.</p></sec><sec><title>Selection of VSD Closure Device</title><p>Size of VSD was measured by TEE in 4-chamber and long axis views. The
greatest of the two values was considered for device selection. VSD occluder
device (muscular or perimembranous: mplatz, AGA Medical Corporation, USA;
Cardi-O-Fix, Starway Medical Technologies, Inc., Spain) or Duct occluder
device (Amplatz, AGA Medical Corporation, Plymouth, MN, USA) 1-2 mm larger
than size of VSD was selected. Routinely, muscular VSD device was selected
for closure of VSD. Perimembranous VSD device was selected for VSDs in
perimembranous location with &#x0003c;5mm muscular margin for device deployment.
Duct occluder device was selected for mid-muscular or apical muscular VSDs
where it deemed difficult to properly deploy right side of disc due to
presence of ventricular trabeculations.</p></sec><sec><title>Additional Procedure</title><p>In patient with associated PDA, anterior approach through the same incision
with a metal clip before deployment of VSD device was used for surgical
closure.</p></sec><sec><title>Surgical closure of VSD on CPB Through Cervical Cannulation</title><p>A transverse cervical incision 1.5-2 cm in length was performed at one
finger's breadth above clavicle between two heads of sternocleidomastoid
muscles. Common carotid artery (CCA) and internal jugular vein (IJV) were
looped. After heparinisation (400 U/kg), 5 mm polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE)
graft was anastomosed to common carotid artery. The graft was cannulated
with aortic cannula and connected to arterial line. IJV was clamped
cranially and opened transversely. Straight venous cannula was inserted and
advanced into the right atrium and connected to venous line.</p></sec><sec><title>Conduct of CPB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>)</title><p>
<fig id="f2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Operative photograph of surgical closure of VSD on CPB with
cervical cannulation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-32-03-0184-g02"/></fig>
</p><p>After achieving adequate activated clotting time (ACT), CPB was initiated.
Carbon dioxide was continuously insufflated into the operative field
throughout the procedure. Inferior vena cava (IVC) was dissected, looped and
cannulated with angled venous cannula that was advanced into the pericardial
cavity through a stab incision in subxiphoid area. IVC was snugged. Mild
hypothermia (30-32&#x000b0;C) was established. De Bakey atraumatic coarctation clamp
was applied through a stab incision in the right 2<sup>nd</sup> intercostal
space in mid-axillary line. Del Nido cardioplegia was delivered into the
aortic root. IJV cannula was pulled back into superior vena cava (SVC) and
SVC was snugged. Right atrium (RA) was opened and a vent was inserted into
the left atrium through patent foramen ovale.</p></sec><sec><title>Surgical Repair</title><p>Repair was performed with midline sternotomy approach except that leaflet of
tricuspid valve was detached from annulus to expose the borders of VSD. At
the end of VSD closure, RA was repaired and SVC and IVC snuggers were
removed. Ventricular pacing wire was placed. De-airing was performed and
under low flows, aortic cross clamp was removed and IJV cannula was advanced
into RA. Time was allowed for the heart to recover the sinus rhythm with
good contractility of the ventricles. After re-warming of the patient, IVC
cannula was removed and IVC repaired. After confirming adequate de-airing on
TEE, cardioplegia puncture site was repaired. Finally, CPB was terminated in
usual fashion.</p><p>At the end of the procedure, IJV cannula was removed and IJV was repaired
with interrupted 6-0 prolene sutures. Heparin was reversed with protamine.
PTFE graft was severed near anastomosis with CCA and over sewn to prevent
any residual stump. CCA pulsation was confirmed and wound closed.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Postoperative Care and Follow-Up</title><p>All the patients were shifted to intensive care unit (ICU) intubated and managed
as per ICU protocol. Postoperative TTE was performed in all the patients before
extubation to confirm the adequacy of procedure, residual defect and any
complication. Patients were extubated once the clinical condition and arterial
blood gases were normal and no evidence of hemolysis or procedural complication
on TTE was found. Patients were soon discharged from the ICU and the hospital,
if postoperative course was uneventful. All the patients were followed-up with
physical examination one week, one month, three months and then six months after
surgery to assess the cosmetic result, sternal mobility and any other infirmity.
Postoperatively, TTE was performed three months after hospital discharge and at
any time during the follow-up period if warranted to evaluate for residual shunt
across VSD and pulmonary artery (PA) pressures (estimated by tricuspid
regurgitation jet velocity). Residual shunt was classified as trivial (&#x0003c;1
mm), small (1-2 mm), moderate (2-4 mm), or large (&#x0003e;4 mm).</p><p>Aspirin (5 mg/kg) was administered for 12 months and oral diuretics (furosemide,
1 mg/kg) for the first three to six months.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS version 20.0 software (SPSS Inc,
USA). The data were presented as mean &#x000b1; SD, range and in number

patients. Mean procedure time excluding surgical preparation time was

patient, perimembranous in nine patients, and PDA in two patients. Mean VSD
occluder device size was 10.91&#x000b1;2.87 mm. Immediately after VSD device

</p></sec><sec><title>Complications and Deaths</title><p>No incidence of device related complications, embolization or LV outflow
obstruction was found. No in-hospital death was observed either. A patient died
one day after discharge. This patient was operated for device closure of
muscular VSD and was discharged in a good condition on the 4<sup>th</sup>
postoperative day. The patient was brought to emergency department by the
parents on the following day in a gasping state and died despite resuscitation.
The cause of death was unknown as parents refused autopsy, thus, it was presumed
to be due to arrhythmias.</p></sec><sec><title>Heart blocks and Arrhythmias</title><p>Two patients with perimembranous VSD had prolongation of PR interval following
device deployment which recovered spontaneously in few hours. None of the
patient developed complete heart block (CHB). However, as a protocol, in all
patients, both atrial and ventricular temporary epicardial pacing wires were
inserted at the time of closure of sternotomy and left in-situ until the time of
discharge.</p></sec><sec><title>Follow-Up</title><p>For 35 patients who survived, follow-up was complete. Mean duration of the
follow-up period was 23.30&#x000b1;18.45 months. All patients had satisfactory
wound healing. Final cosmetic results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>. During the follow-up period, all patients were
asymptomatic, had weight gain and near complete regression of PA hypertension.
Six months after the procedure, all drugs except aspirin were stopped. On repeat
echocardiography six months after surgery, none of the patient had shunt across
the device and no TR.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Transverse split sternotomy is cosmetically aesthetic, as the incision is small, more
obscure, along the Langer's lines and easily hidden especially in females. Also,
sternal stability is maintained as sternum is split transversely. It avoids the risk
of damage to the mammary gland, pectoral muscle mal-development and scoliosis.
Moreover, there is less postoperative pain and bilateral pleural barriers are
intact. Thus, it does not compromise spontaneous ventilation. Cervical cannulation
for CPB moves almost whole of the hardware away from the operative field. This
incision provides equally good exposure of RA, RV, pulmonary arteries and aorta.
Therefore, any site of RV free wall puncture can be selected as per the site of VSD.
Along with this, PDA can be ligated if required. PA banding can also be easily
performed through this approach. However, the need for PA banding as a
contraindication for this approach as the patient will require surgical removal of
PA band and PA plasty in the future. This will need midline sternotomy and the
resulting scar will be cosmetically worse.</p><p>For both percutaneous and perventricular device closure of VSD, lower body weight
(&#x0003c;5.2 kg) has been found to be the strongest risk factor for procedure failure,
device-related complications, and hospital mortality<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>. Patients
in our study were substantially at high risk by virtue of their age, weight, and
nutritional status as they were relatively younger (mean age: 7.14&#x000b1;3.24
months), had lower body weight (mean weight: 5&#x000b1;0.88 kg) and poor nutritional
status [protein energy malnutrition (PEM) grade III-IV in 85%]. We had 97.2%
procedure success with 2.8% incidence of conversion to surgical closure. No
in-hospital mortality was observed, however, 30-day mortality was 2.8%. The smallest
patient who had successful procedure in our series was 2.5 kg. Our results show that
perventricular VSD closure in any location amenable to device can be safely
performed using transverse split sternotomy even in high risk patients with
acceptable morbidity and mortality. Moreover, in case of procedure failure or any
complication; surgical closure of VSD can be performed through the same incision
with cervical cannulation without compromising the exposure.</p><p>Dreaded complications reported after perventricular device closure of VSD are device
embolization<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>, cardiac perforation, and rarely
intra-operative death<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. Other
complications are blood loss requiring blood transfusion, hematoma, CHB, ventricular
tachyarrhythmia, hypotension, injury of the aortic valve, stroke, and device-related
hemolysis<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>. In our series, we did not
encounter any of these complications except two patients who developed transient
prolongation of PR interval after device closure of perimembranous VSD that
recovered spontaneously. Early or late conduction blocks after device closure are
more frequent in patients with &#x0003c;10 kg weight and who have higher device: defect
ratio<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>. We believe that heart blocks can be avoided by
careful patient selection, avoiding inlet type of defects and avoiding over sizing
the device. Similarly, sustained ventricular arrhythmia or mechanical LV
complications can be prevented by gradual up- gradation of sheath size rather than
direct insertion of a large sheath into the RV free wall<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Only one death was observed in our series, an
infant who died one day after hospital discharge probably due to ventricular
arrhythmia.</p><p>Other complications associated with perventricular device closure include LV
pseudoaneurysm<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>,
unexpanded RV disc protruding into pericardium<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>, incomplete RV
disc expansion with screw or disc protruding into the pericardium<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>-<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup>. None of these
complications was found in our series.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Our promising results suggest that perventricular device closure of VSD using
mini-invasive transverse split sternotomy in selected high-risk infants is a safe
and effective alternative strategy to the conventional perventricular or surgical
closure especially in low weight infants.</p><sec><title>Limitation</title><p>An observational study with a small number of patients, without any randomized
comparison with midline sternotomy arm or surgical closure arm, with a
medium-term follow-up period. Patients are still under follow-up for long-term

surgeon. It is a quite rare trauma, with only 4-5% of patients undergoing surgery
for DI. The main cause of DI are blunt trauma of the chest and abdomen (75%),
whereas, more rarely, DI are due by penetrating trauma (25%)<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. Clinical presentations are
different among patients: they can range from unstable hemodynamic condition linked
to active bleeding from organs and diaphragm, to dyspnea and intestinal obstruction
due to visceral herniation of abdominal organs in the thoracic cavity. In this case
report, the diaphragmatic injury could not go unnoticed because the patient was
admitted with a knife still in place, following a suicide attempt.</p></sec><sec><title>CASE REPORT</title><p>A 59-year-old man with self-inflicted penetrating chest trauma was admitted in our
hospital. He tried before to commit suicide hanging himself with a rope, as the
signs on his neck revealed. The patient arrived on mechanical ventilation. His blood
pressure was 90/50 mmHg, the heartbeat was 92 bpm and haemoglobin was 10.8 mg/dl. On
clinical examination, the patient had still the knife into his body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1-1</xref>) with whole blade inflicted just below
the xiphoidal process, leaving outside only the knife handle. Pre-operative computed
tomography (CT) scan showed critical proximity between the knife blade and the right
ventricle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1-2</xref>) so suspecting a right
ventricle injury arterial femoral cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass was
achieved. A median sternotomy was performed, the pericardium was longitudinally
opened draining about of 500 ml of haematic fluid and the knife was safely removed
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1-3</xref>). Intraoperative findings
showed pericardial and diaphragmatic lesions with heart and abdominal organs
integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1-4</xref>). The diaphragmatic
lesion showed an active bleeding into the mediastinum. A direct suture of the
diaphragm muscle was not possible because of the huge laceration and the friable
edges so the diaphragm muscle was repaired with a CorMatrix&#x000ae; patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1-5</xref>). Chest drain tubes were placed and
the sternum was closed with interrupted steel wires. Despite the diaphragmatic
surface has been increased in order to repair the muscle itself, patient&#x02019;s gas
exchanges were not affected. The patient, in fact, was extubated the day after
surgery. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on
the 5<sup>th</sup> postoperative day, after a psychiatric consulting.</p><p>

</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The diaphragm is the main respiratory muscle and it has the most significant function
in respiratory excursion, carrying more than 70% of the work. Moreover, it has the
ability to maintain the negative thoracic pressure necessary for respiratory
mechanics and to promote the venous return to the heart. The diaphragm muscle
separates the chest from the abdomen, two cavities with different pressure inside.
Any lesion of this muscle causes a possible migration of the abdominal organs in the
thorax. This phenomenon could lead to respiratory failure and cardiovascular
collapse, due to alterations of the respiratory mechanics and the venous return.
Although diaphragmatic perforation caused by stab wounds are rare, they could cause
the herniation of the abdominal contents into the thoracic cavity leading to
life-threatening complications<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.
Its diagnosis is difficult despite the continuous development in radiological and
echographic fields. Diaphragmatic injury may present acutely with haemodynamic and
respiratory compromise and be associated with significant lesions to other organs or
may not be diagnosed at the initial trauma at all and present later as a
diaphragmatic hernia. In our case the diaphragmatic injury could not go unnoticed
because the patient was admitted with a knife still in place, following a suicide
attempt. In literature, the first report of diaphragmatic trauma dates back to 1853,
when Bowditch<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> described a
diaphragmatic injury, in a dead victim of a gunshot penetrating trauma, during the
autopsy. The first repair with positive outcomes of a penetrating diaphragmatic
injury was described by Riolfi, in 1886<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. Preoperative diagnosis of diaphragmatic injury is still a
diagnostic challenge. The high mortality is also caused by the difficulty of
studying this anatomical site in emergency conditions. Historically, CT-scan showed
poor visualization of the diaphragm due to motion of the muscle itself. However, the
advent of multiphasic spiral CT has led to a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of
90%. Diaphragmatic injuries include wounds and diaphragm ruptures, due to a
thoraco-abdominal blunt or penetrating traumas. The surgical treatment is
controversial, particularly for the surgical approach and techniques.</p><p>The choice of surgical approach is debated. Laparoscopy and thoracoscopy are now the
diagnostic and therapeutic choices. Laparoscopy allows assessment and repair of the
diaphragm. The thoracoscopic approach is probably more useful in obvious thoracic
injuries and in right-sided penetrating thoracoabdominal injuries. Surgical
treatment consists of hernia reduction, pleural drainage and repair of diaphragmatic
defect. Most diaphragmatic defects may be repaired primarily, especially in the
acute setting due to the pliability of the diaphragm. However, for larger defects
and patients with a delayed presentation, the diaphragmatic defect may be too large
to repair primarily or the edges have become too thin and weak to hold suture. The
stress of the continued use of the diaphragm during breathing, coughing, Valsalva,
and even during cardiac motion are reasons enough for the use of a mesh repair for
any large diaphragmatic defect or rupture. In cases of diaphragmatic disruption due
to massive trauma, prosthetic non-absorbable mesh material is used to reconstruct
the diaphragm. Synthetic mesh is a durable, cost-effective prosthesis that has been
used for decades. However, an increasing amount of data is emerging regarding the
complications of synthetic mesh repair, such as adhesion formation, erosion into
surrounding structures, infections and need for subsequent explantation. This has
led to an increase interest in the potential use of other patches for this purpose.
Biological scaffold materials composed of extracellular matrix have already been
shown to facilitate the constructive remodelling of many different
tissues<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. The
extracellular matrix scaffold materials are derived from a variety of tissues,
including heart valves, nerves, skeletal muscle and tendons. The mechanisms by which
biological scaffold materials promote site-appropriate tissue reconstruction are not
yet well understood. A number of different products available in the market are used
in reconstructive surgery for various tissues and organs. In our case, we have used
the CorMatrix&#x000ae; patch consisting of material made from small intestinal
submucosa derived from pig jejunum and has been already used as an acellular
biological scaffold in many different surgical applications<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. In its natural form, the
CorMatrix&#x000ae; patch consists primarily of several types of collagens, with
smaller, but significant, amounts of glycosaminoglycans, glycoproteins and growth
factors. CorMatrix&#x000ae; scaffold is composed also by proteoglycans and other
non-fibrillar support structures (such as hyaluronic acid), which are very important
for the healing processes. Hyaluronic acid is thought to help regulate the matrix
density and inhibit scar formation during the healing process. Human endothelial and
smooth muscle cells have been grown in vitro on hyaluronic acid biomaterial
constructs with the objective to develop a new tissue-engineered vascular
substitute<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. It is more
resistant to infection and may be placed in infected fields with minimal risk of
infection compared to synthetic mesh. Trauma patients with blunt diaphragmatic
rupture often have a concomitant bowel or lung injury with contamination. Then,
CorMatrix&#x000ae; scaffold can be placed in these hostile environments with less
risk of infection when compared to synthetic mesh. Using this type of material to
reinforce a structure that continually moves like the diaphragm could be
advantageous in that the diaphragm can repair itself via normal biologic pathways.
Synthetic inert materials without the ability to catalyze regeneration and
incorporation into dynamic native tissues may be subjected to fatigue stress of the
material and suture due to the constant movement of the diaphragm.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, this case could be considered as a very rare form of suicide attempt
with double distinctive elements: &#x0201c;self-made hanging&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;self-inflicted
penetrating chest trauma&#x0201d; by a large knife used for diving activities. In order to
repair diaphragmatic lesion, the use of CorMatrix&#x000ae; patch may be considered as
an acceptable alternative to the traditional synthetic mesh avoiding infection and
repeated herniation.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="10%" span="1"/><col width="90%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors&#x02019; roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FJ</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Conception and study design; realization of operations;

The altered genes were related to proto-oncogenes, apoptosis, immune regulatory genes, cytoskeletal element, metabolism, and so forth. Besides the genomic approach, we further compared the protein profiles with a proteomic approach in this study. The isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) is a shotgun-based technique which allows the concurrent identification and relative quantification of hundreds of proteins in up to different biological samples in a single experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. With the iTRAQ approach, a large-scale evaluation of differential protein expression in the formation of the hypertrophic scar may be valuable for finding scar-related proteins or the potential target to control the hypertrophic scar.</p><p>In this article, we revealed the differential proteomics between the hypertrophic scar and normal skin tissues.

Survey MS spectra were collected (m/z 400 to 1500) for 1&#x000a0;s followed by three MS/MS measurements on the most intense parent ions (80 counts/s threshold, +2 to +4 charge state, and m/z 100 to 1500 mass range for MS/MS), using the manufacturer&#x02019;s &#x0201c;smart exit&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;iTRAQ&#x0201d; settings. The &#x0201c;smart exit&#x0201d; option is a standard feature of the QStar Elite instrument, which runs under control of Analyst QS 2.0 software. It allows termination of MS/MS spectrum collection when preset values of peak intensity (quality of the spectra) are reached. In this way, the instrument spends less time for MS/MS acquisition of abundant species and improves chances for detection of low-abundant ones. Spectral quality setting 5 (whole scale 1&#x02013;20) was used throughout the experiments. Predefined &#x0201c;iTRAQ&#x0201d; settings adjust (increase) collisional energy to maximize the intensity of reporter ions (114, 115, 116, 117&#x000a0;Da) in MS/MS spectra. Individual Wiff files generated after QStar Elite analysis were converted to mascot generic file (MGF) format using Mascot.dll script in Analyst QS 2.0.

Using 2D-MS/MS followed by GO-Analysis, we demonstrate 89 proteins with a high annotation confidence (&#x02265;95&#x000a0;%) present differently in the hypertrophic scar. Among the differential proteins, 41 proteins increased and 48 proteins decreased in the hypertrophic scar. Consistent with previous studies, the up-regulated proteins such as COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, COL5A1, COMP, FN1, THBS1, and TNC were involved in extracellular matrix production, myofibroblast contractility, and response to mechanical stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Interestingly, most of the down-regulated proteins, including DSC3, DSP, EVPL, JUP, and PPL, were specific to the epidermis and involved in the cell junction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Some of the differentially expressed candidates identified by iTRAQ have previously been associated with hypertrophic scar formation. Of the up-regulated proteins, increased COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, FN1, and TNC expression have been reported in the hypertrophic scar. COMP plays a role as a matrix deposition promoter in the keloid (the special fibrotic skin disease) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. It has been reported that THBS1 may modulate keloid formation through up-regulation of the matrix plasminogen/plasmin system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, no data revealed the potential effects of COMP and THBS1 on the hypertrophic scar formation. Our work for the first time found COMP and THBS1 were up-regulated in the hypertrophic scar, which might be attributed to a new therapeutic target.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, the iTRAQ analyses followed by the high-throughput 2D LC-MS/MS in our study for the first time screened protein expression of the hypertrophic scar and normal skin tissue on a large scale from the same patients. Some of the screened proteins in our study have been reported in previous researches. However, some of the up-regulated proteins such as COMP and THBS1 and the down-regulated proteins could indicate that the pathologic process of hypertrophic scar formation which might guide us to propose new strategies against the hypertrophic scar.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>JT carried out the sample collection, molecular studies, and drafted the manuscript.

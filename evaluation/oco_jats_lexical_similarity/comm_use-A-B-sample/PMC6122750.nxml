universities and hospitals. Having that will in our hearts, we started our journey in
our own cities, Mogi das Cruzes-SP, and Brasilia-DF, both in Brazil. Not knowing each
other, we heard about The William J. Harrington Medical Training Program for Latin
America and the Caribbean at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. In view
of the professional and intellectual relevance that an exchange can provide, in addition
to the opportunity for personal and cultural growth, the choice to participate in this
program has presented itself as a major challenge: totally new and unknown context.
However, it would undoubtedly be a great and exciting experience.</p><p>The program offers a wide range of opportunities. Since its inception, more than 3,500
international physicians and medical students have participated in
observerships<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.
It accepts hundreds of medical students per year into rotations in every medical
specialty, its subspecialties and in other areas of Medicine. It allows students to
participate in morning rounds, clinics, watch surgeries, prepare and attend case
presentations, lectures and seminars. We had the opportunity to see how different
Medicine could be in different countries and how the advances in Medicine take long to
arrive at our country. Thus, one study on medical education shows that international
exchanges allows students to behold different models of doctor-patient relationship and
interacting with different professionals could improve their social and intercultural
skills<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>We both had the privilege to rotate with the Cardiothoracic Surgery team at the Jackson
Memorial Hospital, which is exceptionally led by Tomas Salerno, MD. Salerno is a
professor of surgery, Vice Chairman for Faculty Development and Mentoring in the
Department of Surgery, and Chairman of the University of Miami Faculty Senate. Besides
his great ability to teach, Dr. Salerno showed himself as a brilliant and passionate
physician who absolutely loves to operate and treat every patient as his own family.
Besides that, he turned out to be an example of humanity and dedication: in his
seventies, he still goes to the hospital on weekends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). It was our honor to participate in his surgeries and learn how
Medicine does not only consist of treating diseases. Medicine involves the patients,
families, nurses and all the healthcare professionals.</p><p>
<fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Tomas Salerno, MD (middle), and the medical students Beatriz Branco and
Camila Ribeiro (left and right, respectively).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-33-04-0428-g01"/></fig>
</p><p>One of Dr. Salerno's teachings lie on how frustrating it can be to a physician dealing
with a noncompliant patient. When a patient fails to follow clear instructions and gets
into a worse state than before, it is hard to deal with frustration and which part of
the guilt could be truly attributed to the physician<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. Surgeons, specially, have a difficult time
trying to decide who will benefit from the surgery and who will benefit from no
operation at all. The Cardiothoracic Surgery department at Jackson does not stop, there
were different cases to participate every day, such as: valves replacement, pericardial
window, heart transplants, and, daily, coronary artery bypass graft. Oftentimes, Dr.
Salerno would perform a coronary bypass without the assistance of another surgeon in the
room, using the off-pump technique.</p><p>Coincidentally, Professor Salerno is Brazilian, from the state of Minas Gerais, and his
name is internationally prestigious in cardiac surgery. The Brazilian cardiac surgery is
known to be the house of important advances in surgery techniques, such as the beating
heart revascularization technique, the use of double internal mammary grafting, and the
current surgical treatment of heart failure. Thus, in 1958, Brazilian doctors developed
the extracorporeal circulation equipment and ten years later, in 1968, the first heart
transplant in Brazil was performed by doctor Euryclides de Jesus Zerbini, only some
months after Christiaan Barnard performed the world's first heart transplant in South
Africa<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>While rotating in the service, the cardiothoracic surgery team had five attendings, three
fellows and two interns - all men. Although we saw women in general surgery, men were
clearly the majority. From this experience abroad and from the experience in Brazil, it
is evident that women are, still, under-represented in academic medicine. Two of the
four consistent evidences found in one review study that aimed to discuss the reasons
women had to choose or deny spots in academic medicine were that women lack appropriate
mentors and role models and, sadly, they still find trouble with gender discrimination
and bias<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Furthermore, the construction of a "parallel curriculum" is proved to be enriching to
shape the future doctor and for the personal development of medical students. In Brazil,
studies at six different medical schools showed that, by the third year of medical
school, students were, somehow, already connected to extracurricular activities, such as
academic leagues, internships and monitoring programs. The students who were evaluated
tended to look for extracurricular activities in order to, mostly, improve the formal
curriculum of medical schools, to refine their medical abilities and to have a
competitive curriculum to apply for medical residencies<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. One of students' major concerns
when they get to the sixth year of medical school - the last, in Brazil - is to study
for the residency exams. Each service has their own exam and the competition is high to
get a spot at a well-known and resourceful hospital. A newspaper has just published that
in 2018, 40% of the residency spots on the country were vacant, because of, mostly, lack
of preceptors and quality programs<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>. In addition, the proficiency in a second language, mainly
English, is proved to be expected from any decent resume, considering that medical
advances and new publications are available first-hand in other languages.</p><p>Besides the fact that an international internship would enrich our resumes, we also get
to test our capacity of working in groups and our fluency in English to use it in favor
of our personal inclinations to humanitarian missions. The attention given to missions
in controlling infectious diseases has shifted over the past decades to aid against
non-transmissible diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, which remains the leading
cause of death worldwide. Therefore, cardiac surgery and cardiology missions' formats
can be varied, from providing preventive clinical care to managing direct surgical
treatment<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Considering the observership in its entirety, we could only say that there was no better
way to improve our medical capacity and expand our cultural boundaries if not
challenging ourselves to dwell between the walls of an unknown hospital, city and
people.</p><table-wrap id="t1" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="5%" span="1"/><col width="95%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BJSB</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Substantial contributions to the conception or

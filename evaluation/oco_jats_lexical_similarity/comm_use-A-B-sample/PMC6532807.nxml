Age, education, and sex were evenly distributed across groups through purposive sampling.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The largest cause of concern was the waiting process for obtaining test results. Most had experienced swift referral, and it was difficult for participants to understand how the new standard could impact upon time progressing through the system. Responsibility for meeting the standard was also a concern: participants did not see their own behaviours as a form of involvement. The GP&#x02019;s role was conceptualised by patients as communicating about their referral, establishing patients&#x02019; preferences for information, and continued involvement at each stage of the referral process. The standard legitimised chasing for test results, but 28 days was considered too long.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Patients should be asked what they would like to know about their referral. GPs should be more transparent about the referral process and the potential for a lack of clarity around next steps.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>early diagnosis</kwd><kwd>Faster Diagnosis Standard</kwd><kwd>general practice</kwd><kwd>patient experience</kwd><kwd>referral and consultation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The diagnostic process for cancer is complex and multifaceted,<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> with ongoing public pressure to expedite and improve it. The NHS Five Year Forward View included a recommendation to develop and implement the Faster Diagnosis Standard (FDS), in which patients will receive a diagnosis or all-clear for cancer within 28 days of referral for diagnostic testing.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> This new standard aims to facilitate a patient-centred, flexible, and rapid approach to cancer diagnosis/non-diagnosis. It is different from existing standards such as urgent referrals, that is, where patients are seen by a specialist within 2 weeks,<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> because it extends further along the cancer care pathway to include the time it takes to confirm or rule out a diagnosis, rather than simply time to the first specialist appointment. It is hoped that implementing the standard will expedite cancer diagnosis, and provide faster reassurance for the majority of people who will not have a cancer diagnosis.</p><p>Evidence surrounding missed opportunities in cancer diagnosis emphasises the importance of patient empowerment to minimise risk of prolonged diagnostic intervals. Patients need to be engaged, or invested, to follow up on test results, re-consult their GP if symptoms persist or worsen, and attend follow-up appointments.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Although patient preferences have been explored regarding communication of a confirmed cancer diagnosis,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and whether or not to initiate referral,<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> there has been limited study of patient communication preferences during referral for diagnostic testing to confirm or rule out cancer.<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Existing studies have used vignette methodology to quantitatively explore patient preferences for referral, for example, demonstrating preferences for investigation at 1% cancer risk,<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> whereas previous qualitative research with people referred on an urgent referral pathway focused on symptom appraisal and help seeking, rather than exploring referral experiences.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>To date, patient views at the point of referral for diagnostic tests to possibly confirm, or rule out, cancer have not been explored and there has been no research to explore public attitudes towards the new FDS. As such, little guidance exists for primary care staff regarding navigation of these conversations at point of referral. There may also be reticence in raising the possibility of cancer at this stage of the diagnostic process, when the majority (90%) of people referred on cancer pathways have cancer ruled out.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> This study explored public attitudes towards the FDS, within the context of people&#x02019;s recent referral experiences.</p></sec><sec><title>METHOD</title><sec><title>Participant selection</title><p>The authors conducted focus groups in two different geographical areas (Guildford, Southeast England; Bradford, Yorkshire and Humber) to access a wide range of opinions and referral experiences, and enable participant reflection and discussion regarding the FDS. Guildford was chosen as the study&#x02019;s southern site for practical reasons as it is where the study team is based. The authors chose Bradford to include an area with a different demographic profile. Bradford has a larger population (approximately 500 000 versus 140 000) and is more ethnically diverse (64% versus 84% of people identify as white British respectively).<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Neither site was involved in the pilot programme for the FDS.</p><boxed-text position="float"><sec><title>How this fits in</title><p>The Faster Diagnosis Standard (FDS) aims to ensure patients will have cancer ruled out or diagnosed within 28 days of referral for diagnostic testing. There is currently no evidence demonstrating how the public may view this standard. This study highlights the pivotal role of the GP within the FDS, as perceived by the public. Recommendations are made to facilitate GP&#x02013;patient conversations at the point of referral under the FDS.</p></sec></boxed-text><p>Focus groups allow examination of people&#x02019;s health service experiences, enabling group discussions to explore attitudes in a way that may be less accessible with individual interviews.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Eligible participants were approached by market research agency Saros Research Ltd through their established volunteer databases over a 4-week period. Purposive sampling ensured that location (rural or urban), sex, and education level were evenly distributed among the sample. The authors chose to run four focus groups following a recent review suggesting that 90% of themes are discoverable within three to six focus groups.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Sample size (<italic>n</italic> = 6&#x02013;8 per focus group) was determined based on recommended numbers for focus groups.<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>To be eligible, participants had to:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>be aged &#x02265;50 years; and</p></list-item><list-item><p>have been referred from primary care for one or more of the following diagnostic investigations within the last 6 months: ultrasound scan, computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI) scan, mammogram, chest X-ray, colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy, endoscopy (other), biopsy. These investigations were taken from the authors&#x02019; previous research exploring the impact of an all-clear diagnosis on subsequent help-seeking for potential cancer symptoms.<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p></list-item></list></p><p>The majority of referrals under the FDS are likely to have cancer ruled out,<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> thus excluding people with a previous or current diagnosis of cancer ensured a homogeneous group to focus on referral experiences and attitudes towards the FDS.</p><p>Two focus groups were conducted in each location (Guildford: University of Surrey; Bradford: Community Empowerment Network (CNet) community centre, Manningham). Participants provided informed consent and completed a demographic questionnaire before taking part. Focus groups lasted approximately 90 minutes.</p></sec><sec><title>Focus groups</title><p>The topic guide was developed with input from cancer survivors, members of the public, and academics external to the research team (the topic guide is available from the authors). Participants were invited to share the most important or meaningful thing to them when being referred by their GP for a clinical test. These topics were then explored more fully, with participants asked to reflect on how their referral experience could have been improved. Following these initial reflections, a definition of the FDS was presented to the group:
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;The Faster Diagnosis Standard is a new care standard, so people referred by their doctor for certain clinical tests will find out whether or not they have cancer within 28 days of the referral.&#x02019;</italic>
<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p></disp-quote></p><p>Participants were asked for their thoughts on the standard, and in what ways their experience of being referred, tested, and receiving the results might have been influenced, had they been referred under the standard. Participants were also asked whether they thought they had a role to play in meeting the standard, and to explain their reasoning.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Analysis</title><p>Focus group discussions were digitally audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were deductively analysed using thematic analysis.<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> For each focus group a single researcher familiarised themselves with the transcript, abstracting the conversation for analysis meetings with three others from the research team. The initial setting of themes within a framework was reviewed for fit, and further refined by the research team. Refinement was inductive and derived from concepts grounded in the data using mind maps. This allowed concept integration into meaningful themes, and associations between themes to be explored. Key recommendations were generated and conveyed at an event at Cancer Research UK attended by academics external to the project, Cancer Research UK staff, and patient representatives. Event feedback was used to finalise the analysis and recommendations.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>The focus groups had a total of 29 participants and a balanced sex distribution (males <italic>n</italic> = 14, females <italic>n</italic> = 15) and settlement area (urban <italic>n</italic> = 13, rural <italic>n</italic> = 16), and included a range of education levels (<xref rid="table1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;If that&#x02019;s the new standard, 28 days, then we&#x02019;ve got to be frightened of what we&#x02019;ve got now, you know, that&#x02019;s the frightening thing.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(B2, M)</attrib></disp-quote>

<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;It depends on what the problem is and of course the individual, so the GP actually knows the individual, they can actually judge whether they need a lot more reassurance and information, as far as I was concerned I wanted information and, you know, being given options, and it&#x02019;s pretty straightforward, but I know that some people would actually want a lot more reassurance, so I think it is key to it &#x02026; GP actually knowing the patients</italic> &#x02026;<italic>&#x02019;</italic></p><attrib>(B2, M)</attrib></disp-quote>

Increasing consistency and transparency of these processes was perceived as a means to regain this sense of agency:
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;Sometimes it&#x02019;s also about feeling like you have some control of what&#x02019;s going on, rather than it&#x02019;s being done to, so maybe trying to get more of a &#x02026; improve the standard of that communication and be more consistent, so wherever you are and wherever, you know, whatever part you&#x02019;re in, it&#x02019;s a standard way of doing things.</italic>&#x02019;</p><attrib>(B2, F)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>Opaque and inconsistent processes were exemplified within participant experiences of obtaining test results, having to chase for them or receiving them by letter without support:

<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;The thing that swung it for me is that I deliberately chose to go to the one that was further away so it was longer to drive to, but I would be seen quicker and immediately without waiting in the waiting room area, and it was, it was instant, I was just straight in, straight out, and a free car park!</italic> &#x02019;</p><attrib>(G1, F)</attrib></disp-quote>

<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;The point of having performance standards such as this is to drive up standards generally on the performance of the cancer team or whatever, you know, and to minimise the requirement for us the users to be being involved in that process, the responsibility for performance lies with the leadership team, or within the NHS, or wherever it is, and therefore in my view, you know, there shouldn&#x02019;t be a need for the users to have to get involved in this because the whole point of having those performance standards is to make sure that the service that&#x02019;s being delivered is efficient and people know generally within 28 days.</italic>&#x02019;</p><attrib>(B2, M)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>Patients were considered to be passive players in a complex system, as described previously.

Males and females referred by their GP for diagnostic testing in the past 6 months discussed their views and experiences in four focus groups. Most had experienced fast referral, and found it difficult to understand how the new standard could decrease time spent progressing through the system. Speed was just one factor that was considered important when being referred for clinical tests: reassurance, feeling listened to, and transparency within the process were also highly valued. Where responsibility lay for meeting the standard was considered unclear, and participants did not necessarily view their own behaviours to secure an appointment or obtain test results as a form of involvement in this. The GP&#x02019;s role was conceptualised as communicating with them about their referral, establishing their information needs, and maintaining involvement at each stage of the referral process. Reflecting on their own recent experiences, one of the main concerns was the process of waiting for and obtaining test results: people felt strongly that they did not want to receive results by letter and should not have to chase them.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>These findings are the first to illuminate public attitudes towards the FDS. By drawing upon recent referral experiences of the public, this study provides insight into factors for consideration by doctors and wider stakeholder groups, ensuring public views are taken into account as the standard is rolled out. A major strength is the development of key recommendations in collaboration with patients with cancer, members of the public, and academic experts in primary care and cancer diagnosis. It should be recognised that these findings are specific to those who were given an all clear for cancer, but this comprises 90% of people referred for clinical tests in this context.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> However, this means the authors cannot draw conclusions about the experiences or attitudes towards the FDS of those with a previous or current cancer diagnosis.</p><p>The authors included clinical tests from their previous research in primary care<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> but acknowledge that the broad spectrum of tests meant not everyone in the present study would have been referred according to a cancer pathway and there would have been variation in how people received their test results. However, the authors felt it was important to keep the range broad because, first, their main aim was to use people&#x02019;s referral experiences to anchor the conversation about the FDS and, second, that people may not have known that they were referred on a cancer pathway and so may have been unnecessarily excluded. Future research could further delineate patient experiences of referral by exploring different ways of accessing diagnostic tests, for example, &#x02018;straight to test&#x02019;, referral to a specialist or multi-diagnostic centre and so on, and how these influence the patient pathway.</p><p>Importantly, views of GPs and other healthcare professionals should be considered before FDS roll-out, as recent evidence suggests GPs in the UK were less likely to retain responsibility for patient follow-up compared with non-UK GPs.<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Finally, purposive sampling helped promote diversity, with equal sex representation and inclusion of differing ethnic groups, educational backgrounds, and geography, though the authors acknowledge that another limitation is that the sample was still mainly white British and well educated.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with existing literature</title><p>A recent King&#x02019;s Fund-commissioned inquiry paper<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> highlighted the importance of a feeling that progress is being made through the system following GP referral,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> suggesting that providing information regarding the referral process can increase patient satisfaction.<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> This supports the need for balance between speed of referral or testing and care aspects such as information, trust, and communication.</p><p>In the present study, the GP was identified as having a key role in maintaining this balance, including signposting to appropriate services and determining how much information to provide about the referral, based on their knowledge of the patient and their support needs. Previous studies also identified the importance of patients feeling they are listened to, or taken seriously, by the GP,<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> receiving advice from the GP regarding choice of hospital,<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and having their information and support needs understood.

Letters have been identified previously as a slow form of communication for results of importance,<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> and communication by letter held strong negative connotations for participants in the current study. Similar to findings by Litchfield <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> patients felt that while it is necessary to chase up results when they had not been communicated, it should not have to fall to them to do so.</p><p>Participants saw the FDS as a way of clarifying when they could rightfully phone to chase test results, but the majority felt 28 days was too long to wait for suspected cancer, and they would contact providers sooner than this. Previous qualitative studies have shown that patients who went on to have a cancer diagnosis considered a 2-week wait to be too long, provoking anxiety.<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Awareness of current standards for diagnostic referral for cancer was low within the group, with both over- and underestimates of waiting timeframes reported by participants within discussions. This finding is supported by other qualitative research indicating low awareness of current urgent referral pathways for cancer diagnosis.<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> While participants in the present study did not have a diagnosis of cancer, many conveyed an expectation that their progress through the pathway would be speedier if cancer was highly suspected. Low awareness of current norms may therefore contribute to the perception that 28 days is too long to wait to have cancer ruled in or out.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Implications for practice</title><p>The study findings provide an evidence base upon which to make recommendations that may help GPs and other healthcare professionals when the FDS is introduced.

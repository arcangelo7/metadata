In past decades, extensive efforts have been devoted to developing bone biomaterials with a focus on the following issues: (1) developing ideal biomaterials with a combination of suitable biological and mechanical properties; (2) constructing a cell microenvironment with pores ranging in size from nanoscale to submicro- and microscale; and (3) inducing the oriented differentiation of stem cells for artificial-to-biological transformation. Here we present a comprehensive review of the state of the art of bone biomaterials and their interactions with stem cells. Typical bone biomaterials that have been developed, including bioactive ceramics, biodegradable polymers, and biodegradable metals, are reviewed, with an emphasis on their characteristics and applications. The necessary porous structure of bone biomaterials for the cell microenvironment is discussed, along with the corresponding fabrication methods. Additionally, the promising seed stem cells for bone repair are summarized, and their interaction mechanisms with bone biomaterials are discussed in detail. Special attention has been paid to the signaling pathways involved in the focal adhesion and osteogenic differentiation of stem cells on bone biomaterials. Finally, achievements regarding bone biomaterials are summarized, and future research directions are proposed.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>As an important tissue/organ in the human body, the bone plays a vital role in not only protecting the organs inside the body but also providing mechanical support, hematopoiesis, and mineral storage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1 bib2 bib3">1&#x02013;3</xref></sup> Moreover, it can coordinate with muscular tissue to accomplish various movements and respond to environmental changes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> Although bone has a certain capability for regeneration and self-repair,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> large segmental bone defects caused by severe trauma, tumor resection, cancer, or congenital diseases can only be repaired by bone grafting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> In recent years, there has been an increasing demand for bone biomaterials, which are also called bone graft substitutes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> In the United States, over 2 million surgeries are conducted each year to repair damaged or fractured bones by grafting. As a result, the bone biomaterial market in the United States exceeded 39 billion dollars in 2013.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> In China, the number of patients with limited limb function due to bone defects has reached up to 10 million.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> However, many patients cannot be treated effectively due to the lack of bone biomaterial availability. Consequently, they must settle for less desirable options, such as amputation due to bone tissue necrosis, which places a great burden on both the patients and society.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> Therefore, bone defects have become a serious social problem, and more effort should be devoted toward developing bone biomaterials for bone repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup></p><p>The structure of natural bone is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. In terms of composition, natural bone is a composite material composed of organic and inorganic materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> The organic materials are mainly collagen fibers containing tropocollagen, which endow the bone with a certain toughness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> The inorganic materials are mainly calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) in the form of hydroxyapatite (HA) crystals, as well as sodium (Na), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), fluoride (F), chlorine (Cl), carbonate (CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2&#x02212;</sup>), and some trace elements, such as silicon (Si), strontium (Sr), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), and copper (Cu), which endow the bone with a certain strength.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> In terms of structure, natural bone has a multi-scale structure that can be divided into cortical bone and cancellous bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> Cortical bone is located at the surface of the bone and contains 99% of the Ca and 90% of the phosphate in the human body. It is relatively dense and strong, with a low porosity of 5%&#x02013;10%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> Cancellous bone is spongy, and this tissue is distributed inside the bone. It is formed by intertwining lamellar trabeculae, which contain hematopoietic cells, adipose tissue, and blood vessels. Cancellous bone accounts for only 20 wt% of the bone in the human body, but its porosity reaches 50%&#x02013;90%, with a specific surface area almost 20 times that of cortical bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> These special compositions and structures endow bone with superior properties to accomplish various functions. However, the composition and structure of bone vary with the defect site, age, genetic inheritance, and living conditions of patients, resulting in different demands for bone implants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> Therefore, it has long been a challenge to develop ideal bone biomaterials that meet the requirements for bone repair.</p><p>As a bridge between native tissues and seeded cells, bone biomaterials play a vital role in bone repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> The specific biomaterial and porous structure can guide and control the type, structure, and function of regenerated tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> To obtain a composition, structure, and function similar to that of natural bone, the following issues regarding bone biomaterials should be addressed: (1) developing ideal biomaterials with appropriate biological properties and mechanical performance. Bone biomaterials should primarily meet safety requirements, such as being non-toxic and not eliciting inflammatory or immune responses. Moreover, they should possess good biocompatibility and bioactivity, as well as controllable biodegradability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> Furthermore, bone biomaterials should not simply fill the bone defects but should also degrade continuously <italic><italic><italic>in vivo</italic></italic></italic>. To avoid compromising the function and structure of new bone, the degradation rate of bone biomaterials should match the growth rate of new bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> Additionally, bone biomaterials should possess mechanical properties and stability appropriate for the defect site because biomaterials need to provide structural support for both the defect site and the newly formed tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> (2) Constructing a cell microenvironment with pore sizes on the nano-, submicro-, and microscale. A multi-scale porous structure can provide the necessary space and environment for the growth of different cells and tissues and facilitate extracellular matrix (ECM) formation, nutrient transport, and nerve and blood vessel ingrowth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> Since the site and structure of bone defects differ among patients, bone biomaterials should have a customizable external shape and internal structure to match the defect site and provide long-term stability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> (3) Inducing the oriented differentiation of stem cells for artificial-to-biological transformation. Positive interactions between bone biomaterials and cells are necessary to facilitate cell functions, such as adhesion, proliferation, differentiation, and gene expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> More importantly, bone biomaterials should have good osteoinductivity, that is, the ability to induce the differentiation of stem cells into osteogenic cells, leading to the formation of bone tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> Good osteoinductivity can provide a compatible interface between a bone biomaterial and native tissue and guide the growth of bone tissue along the interface, eventually resulting in the formation of new bone tissue closely integrated with the bone biomaterial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> Therefore, the above three issues have been intensely investigated over recent years.</p></sec><sec><title>Main types of bone biomaterials</title><p>After implantation, bone biomaterials act as a medium for the contact and interaction of bone implants with the surrounding cells/tissues. Thus, the selection of bone biomaterials is a key step in the preparation of ideal bone implants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> Generally, the selection of bone biomaterials is based on their inherent biocompatibility, biodegradability, and mechanical properties, as well as the resulting cell behavior. In addition, the physicochemical characteristics, molecular weight, and hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of bone biomaterials are also very important.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> As mentioned above, natural bone is composed of cortical and cancellous bone, which exhibit quite different mechanical properties because of their different compositions and structures. It has been reported that the compressive strength, fracture toughness, and elastic modulus of cortical bone are within 100&#x02013;180&#x02009;MPa, 2&#x02013;12&#x02009;MPa&#x000b7;m<sup>1/2</sup>, and 7&#x02013;30&#x02009;GPa, respectively, while those of cancellous bone are within 2&#x02013;12&#x02009;MPa, 0.1&#x02013;0.8&#x02009;MPa&#x000b7;m<sup>1/2</sup>, and 0.2&#x02013;0.5&#x02009;GPa, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33 bib34 bib35">33&#x02013;35</xref></sup> To provide sufficient mechanical support for the defect site and newly formed tissues during bone repair, bone implants should possess mechanical properties that match the natural bone; otherwise, bone repair failure may occur in the human body.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> Therefore, the mechanical properties of bone biomaterials are considered one of the most important selection criteria. Commonly studied bone biomaterials can be categorized as bioceramics, polymers, and biomedical metals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> It has been widely accepted that bioceramics are brittle materials with a low fracture toughness, insufficient mechanical strength, and a high elastic modulus compared with those of cortical bone, while the mechanical strength and elastic modulus of polymers are far below the requirements of cortical bone,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> which significantly limits their application in weight-bearing sites. In the past decade, intensive efforts have been devoted to improving the mechanical properties of bioceramics or polymers by creating composites with other bone biomaterials, but limited improvements have been achieved due to the difficulties in obtaining a uniform dispersion and strong interfacial bonding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41 bib42 bib43 bib44">41&#x02013;44</xref></sup> As a result, currently, bioceramics and/or polymers can only be used as bone stuffing or for the reconstruction of bone defects in cancellous bone, instead of direct weight-bearing applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref></sup> In contrast, biomedical metals generally have a higher mechanical strength than bioceramics and polymers, but their mechanical properties, especially the elastic modulus, are also incompatible with that of natural bone, causing stress shielding and further bone loss, bone relaxation, and osteoporosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref></sup> Therefore, the mechanical properties of current bone biomaterials can not meet the requirements for bone repair, especially in weight-bearing applications.</p><p>Two other important criteria for bone biomaterials are biodegradability and bioactivity. Some bioceramics (including aluminum oxide and zirconium oxide), polymers (including polyurethane and silicone rubber), and biomedical metals (including stainless steel and titanium (Ti) alloys) are non-biodegradable and bioinert materials. Despite good biocompatibility and/or excellent mechanical strength, they cannot biodegrade and thus are retained as permanent implants <italic><italic>in vivo</italic></italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref></sup> Moreover, these biomaterials lack bioactivity and can only bond with bone tissue through mechanical interlocking, which easily results in loosening and wear after long-term implantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49 bib50 bib51">49&#x02013;51</xref></sup> Therefore, recent studies have gradually shifted their focus onto biodegradable and/or bioactive materials, including bioactive ceramics, biodegradable polymers, and biodegradable metals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52 bib53 bib54 bib55">52&#x02013;55</xref></sup></p><sec><title>Bioactive ceramics</title><sec><title>Types and characteristics</title><p>Bioactivity, first proposed by Professor Hench in 1969, is a characteristic of chemical bonding between bone biomaterials and biological tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref></sup> To date, bioactive materials mainly refer to bioactive ceramics, such as Ca&#x02013;P ceramics, Ca&#x02013;Si ceramics, bioactive glasses, and calcium sulfates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref></sup></p><p>As the most representative bioactive ceramics, Ca&#x02013;P ceramics, including HA [Ca<sub>10</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>] and tricalcium phosphate [TCP, Ca<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>], have compositions similar to that of natural bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref></sup> They not only have good biocompatibility and osteoconductivity but can also osseointegrate with the defect site.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref></sup> Moreover, the degradation products and released ions can participate in the human metabolism and create an alkaline environment to enhance cell activity and accelerate bone repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">60</xref></sup> HA is the main mineral of natural bone and thus has been extensively studied as a bone biomaterial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61 bib62 bib63">61&#x02013;63</xref></sup> It has a theoretical density of 3.16&#x02009;g&#x000b7;cm<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> and a Ca/P molar ratio of 1.67.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">63</xref></sup> After implantation, it is capable of guiding new bone growth and forming chemical bonding with bone tissue with a bonding strength 5&#x02013;7 times higher than that between bioinert ceramics and natural bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">64</xref></sup> Meanwhile, HA has good osteoinductivity, and its hydroxyl groups have an ideal affinity for the amino acids, proteins, and organic acids in the human body via hydrogen bonding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">65</xref></sup> However, HA has a relatively high crystallinity and stability, which makes it difficult to degrade <italic><italic>in vivo</italic></italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">66</xref></sup> Compared with HA, TCP is more degradable and becomes soluble more rapidly; its degradation rate is 10&#x02013;20 times higher than that of HA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">66</xref></sup> The degradation products can provide abundant Ca and P for osteoblasts and induce bone regeneration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">67</xref></sup> Furthermore, TCP can form a direct connection with the bone tissue after implantation, without the intervention of fibrous connective tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">68</xref></sup> Bruder <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">69</xref></sup> implanted porous TCP seeded with bone marrow osteoblasts into dogs. After 3 months, the implants had integrated with the host bone, and the bone defects were repaired.</p><p>In recent years, Ca&#x02013;Si ceramics, including wollastonite (CaSiO<sub>3</sub>), akermanite (Ca<sub>2</sub>MgSiO<sub>7</sub>), diopside (CaMgSi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>), hardystonite (Ca<sub>2</sub>ZnSi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>), bredigite (Ca<sub>7</sub>MgSi<sub>4</sub>O<sub>16</sub>), and merwinite (Ca<sub>3</sub>MgSi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>), have been developed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">70</xref></sup> Ca exists in the active area of natural bone and plays an important role in the growth of bones and blood vessels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">71</xref></sup> Si is one of the most important trace elements in the human body, and its content reaches 100&#x02009;ppm in bones and 200&#x02013;550&#x02009;ppm in the ECM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">72</xref></sup> Si is commonly absorbed in the form of metasilicate, which is widely distributed in connective tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">73</xref></sup> Si plays an important role in bone calcification and is beneficial for improving bone density and preventing osteoporosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">72</xref></sup> Especially in the early stage of osteogenesis, a high Si content in new bone can increase the degree of calcification to some extent, while a Si deficiency always causes bone distortion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">74</xref></sup> Some studies have shown that Si can not only promote the synthesis of collagen and proteoglycan but also activate bone-related gene expression and stimulate osteoblast proliferation and differentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">75</xref></sup> It has been reported that the ion products released by Ca&#x02013;Si ceramics can enhance the effectiveness of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) II, which is specifically related to cell proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">76</xref></sup> This enhancement is achieved by inducing the transcription of growth factors and carrier proteins and regulating the separation of binding proteins. Wu <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">77</xref></sup> prepared porous akermanite by a polymer foaming method and analyzed the effect of ion release on cell activity. The results showed that Ca and Si ions could be released from akermanite during the immersion process, which promoted the early mineralization, division, and gene expression of osteoblasts. Moreover, Si ions showed better stimulatory effects on cells than Ca ions. Compared with Ca&#x02013;P ceramics, Ca&#x02013;Si ceramics have shown better performance in terms of mechanical properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78 bib79 bib80 bib81">78&#x02013;81</xref></sup> For example, most Ca&#x02013;Si ceramics, such as diopside and akermanite, have shown a higher bending strength and fracture toughness than HA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">82</xref></sup> Moreover, the relatively wider range of Ca&#x02013;Si ceramics than Ca&#x02013;P ceramics in chemical compositions also has a significant impact on regulating the mechanical properties of bioactive ceramics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">83</xref></sup> Mechanical stability is also an important characteristic of bone implants because they should maintain sufficient mechanical strength to provide support for new tissues before completely degrading.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">84</xref></sup> It was reported that diopside had a better compressive strength and mechanical stability than bioactive glasses and wollastonite.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">85</xref></sup> More specifically, the initial compressive strengths (0.63&#x02013;1.36&#x02009;MPa) of diopside scaffolds with porosities of 75%&#x02013;80% were comparable to that of cancellous bone and lower than that of cortical bone. After 14 days of degradation in simulated body fluid (SBF), the compressive strengths of diopside scaffolds were reduced by 30%, which was much less than the reduction observed for bioactive glass scaffolds (54%) and wollastonite scaffolds (60%) under the same conditions. These features demonstrate the great potential of Ca&#x02013;Si ceramics for application in bone repair.</p><p>Bioactive glasses mainly consist of silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>), phosphorus pentoxide (P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>), and calcium oxide (CaO), and some of them also contain sodium oxide (Na<sub>2</sub>O), potassium oxide (K<sub>2</sub>O), and/or magnesium oxide (MgO).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">86</xref></sup> Based on the differences in composition and proportion, bioactive glasses can be categorized as 45S5 (molar ratio: 46.1% SiO<sub>2</sub>, 24.4% Na<sub>2</sub>O, 26.9% CaO, and 2.6% P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>), 58S (molar ratio: 60% SiO<sub>2</sub>, 36% CaO, and 4% P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>), and 1393 (molar ratio: 54.6% SiO<sub>2</sub>, 22.1% CaO, 6.0% Na<sub>2</sub>O, 1.7% P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, 7.9% K<sub>2</sub>O, and 7.7% MgO), among others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">87</xref></sup> Bioactive glasses have good biocompatibility and an excellent capability for heterogeneous nucleation and apatite deposition. They can form strong chemical bonding with surrounding bone tissue within a short time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">88</xref></sup> In the physiological environment, bioactive glasses release Si, Ca, P, and Na ions through ion exchange, leading to the formation of electronegative Si-OH and a Si-rich gel layer on the surface through polycondensation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">89</xref></sup> On the one hand, the electronegative Si-OH bonds with different types of proteins via hydrogen and ammonia bonding, resulting in high-density protein adsorption. On the other hand, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3&#x02212;</sup>, CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2&#x02212;</sup>, and OH<sup>&#x02212;</sup> in body fluids can be absorbed to form a hydroxycarbonate-apatite (HCA) layer on the surface of the Si-rich gel layer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">89</xref></sup> The Si-rich gel layer and HCA layer each possess a high surface areas and are thus capable of adsorbing large quantities of biomolecules, thereby promoting extracellular responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">89</xref></sup> More importantly, as bioactive glasses are by far the only bioceramics that can form bonding with both hard and soft tissues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">90</xref></sup> they have received great attention as bone biomaterials. Sepulveda <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">91</xref></sup> found that differences in the type and powder properties of bioactive glasses can generate different degradation rates and bioactivities, and thus modulate the release of active ions. Compared with 45S5, 58S had a faster degradation rate and can be completely covered by a high-crystallinity apatite layer after only 1&#x02009;h of immersion. The degradation rates of both bioactive glasses increased with decreasing powder particle size.</p></sec><sec><title>Disadvantages and strategies</title><p>Bioactive ceramics have good biocompatibility and bioactivity and have thus become an important focus in bone biomaterial research. However, there are still some shortcomings in the use of bioactive ceramics as bone biomaterials, such as low toughness and insufficient strength. In particular, the strength of bioactive ceramics is further weakened when used to form porous implants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">92</xref></sup> Therefore, currently, bioactive ceramics can only be used in non- or low-loading applications. To address these problems, researchers have proposed the use of nanoscale second phases,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">93</xref></sup> surface coatings,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">94</xref></sup> and self-toughening methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">95</xref></sup> to improve the mechanical properties of bioactive ceramics.</p><p>The commonly used nanoscale second phases include nanoparticles, nanotubes, and nanosheets. In terms of the dimension of reinforcement, nanoparticles are zero-dimensional reinforcements and are the most popular method for reinforcing ceramics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">96</xref></sup> Nanoparticles possess a large specific surface area and chemical activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">97</xref></sup> and can thus reinforce materials effectively. The typical reinforcement mechanisms of nanoparticles can be summarized as follows: (1) the pinning effect:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">98</xref></sup> when encountering nanoparticles, the crack tip cannot pass through and is deflected because of the pinning effect, which dissipates the fracture energy and thus enhances the mechanical properties of bioactive ceramics. (2) Dispersion reinforcing:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">99</xref></sup> the dispersed nanophase can generate local stress to enhance bioactive ceramics through the mismatch of physicochemical properties, such as Young&#x02019;s modulus and thermal expansion coefficient. (3) Grain refinement:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">100</xref></sup> nanoparticles can inhibit the abnormal growth of ceramic grains, resulting in a uniform and refined grain structure. (4) Fracture mode transformation:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">101</xref></sup> the nanoparticles act as a nucleus and are wrapped by ceramic particles to form an intragranular structure, which weakens the main grain boundary and contributes to transgranular fracture when the bone biomaterial fractures. In comparison, nanotubes and nanosheets are one- and two-dimensional reinforcements, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">102</xref></sup> In recent years, they have attracted increasing attention in ceramic-based composites owing to their large length/diameter and width/thickness ratios, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">103</xref></sup> Commonly used nanotubes and nanosheets include carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104 bib105 bib106 bib107">104&#x02013;107</xref></sup> Their reinforcement mechanisms mainly include the following: (1) crack deflection:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">108</xref></sup> when encountering nanotubes or nanosheets, the crack cannot pass through and can only deflect to continue propagating, which prolongs the path and increases energy consumption for crack propagation. (2) Crack-bridging:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">109</xref></sup> nanotubes or nanosheets bridge both sides of the crack to prevent further propagation and opening. (3) The pull-out effect:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">110</xref></sup> nanotubes or nanosheets are pulled out from the ceramic matrix during crack propagation, which consumes external energy by interfacial friction. Lahiri <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">111</xref></sup> added boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) to HA ceramics and found that the mechanical properties were improved by the sword-in-sheath phenomenon and crack-bridging mechanism of the BNNTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In addition, many studies have confirmed that the large specific surface area and unique structure of nanoscale second phases can not only improve mechanical properties but also promote cell adhesion and proliferation on bioactive ceramics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">112</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">113</xref></sup></p><p>Another reinforcement method is surface treatments to form coatings on the surface of bioactive ceramics.

After heat treatments, the intergranular corrosion was relieved due to changes in the grain size and second phase distribution. The galvanic effect easily occurs due to the corrosion potential difference between the Mg matrix and second phases or impurities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib204">204</xref></sup> In this case, the Mg matrix acts as the anode and undergoes rapid galvanic corrosion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib205">205</xref></sup> For example, a study by Coy <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib206">206</xref></sup> showed that severe galvanic corrosion attacked an as-cast ZE41 Mg alloy due to the combined effects of cathodic precipitates Zr<sub>4</sub>Zn and Mg<sub>7</sub>Zn<sub>3</sub>REE [-REE refers to rare earth elements, such as lanthanum (La), gadolinium (Gd), and cerium (Ce)].

They have excellent potential in bone repair because of the following characteristics: (1) They have excellent proliferation and differentiation potential both <italic><italic>in vivo</italic></italic> and <italic><italic>in vitro</italic></italic>, and they can differentiate into any cell type, including osteoblasts and muscle cells. (2) They have a regulatory immune function; they can inhibit the proliferation and immune activity of T cells through the interactions between cells and cytokines. (3) They have the advantages of being conveniently sourced and easily separated, cultured, amplified, and purified. Additionally, MSCs maintain the characteristics of stem cells after multiple passages without immunological rejection. (4) They have low antigenicity and light allograft rejection, and the matching requirement is not strict. Thus far, several types of MSCs have been investigated for osteogenic differentiation.</p><p>Among various MSCs, BMSCs were first found and isolated and are currently the most commonly used MSCs in experimental and clinical trials. Because they are easily sourced, isolated and cultured and exhibit a strong potential for differentiation and autologous transplantation, they are considered optimal for use in clinical stem cell treatments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib344">344</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib345">345</xref></sup> Recently, Berglund <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib346">346</xref></sup> found that an Mg&#x02013;Ca&#x02013;Sr alloy possessed advantageous characteristics, including good mechanical strength and degradation behavior, and displayed potential osteogenic properties, which were characterized as ALP expression and RUNX2 activation.

Furthermore, there is no ethical controversy surrounding their use. They have broad clinical applications in the regeneration of bone, cartilage, and muscle, among other tissues. Nano-HA/chitosan/PLGA scaffolds induced human UC-MSCs to differentiate into osteoblasts for the repair of calvarial defects in nude mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib351 bib352 bib353">351&#x02013;353</xref></sup></p><p>Dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) were originally isolated from human dental pulp by Gronthos in 2000.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib354">354</xref></sup> He found that DPSCs had similar characteristics, such as osteogenic ability and immunophenotype, to BMSCs, but a better proliferation ability. DPSCs have the capacity for self-renewal and the potential for multilineage differentiation into a variety of cell types.

The attractive advantages of DPSCs can be summarized as follows: (1) there is a rich source of DPSCs in the naturally shed teeth of children 6&#x02013;11 years of age, as well as in the wisdom teeth of adults, which are often removed and discarded as wastes. (2) Minor side effects: DPSCs are a type of MSCs with low immunogenicity, which would not be rejected when transplanted. (3) No ethical controversy: As DPSCs are derived from the naturally shed teeth of children and the wisdom teeth of adults, there would be no side effects for the donor. The differentiation and regeneration ability of DPSCs are impressive, suggesting the potential use of DPSCs for bone repair and regeneration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib356">356</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib357">357</xref></sup> Therefore, DPSCs have gained increasing attention due to their favorable biological characteristics.</p><p>DPSCs were seeded on 3D TCP/poly(<sc>l</sc>-lactic acid/caprolactone) biomaterials and cultured in osteogenic medium containing vitamin D3 for 14 days.

DFATs and the co-culture system might be a novel cell-based therapeutic method for promoting osteogenic differentiation in periodontal regeneration. Cho <italic>et al</italic> reported that the epigenetic modification of Wnt3a by BMP-2 revealed a new mechanism in the morphogen-mediated control of osteogenesis. In their study, the CpG-demethylating agent 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine or the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A was used to decrease the methylation and increase the acetylation of histone H3 lysine 9 specifically in non-osteogenic cells, which contributed to the direct transdifferentiation of pre-adipocyte fibroblasts into osteoblasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib367">367</xref></sup> Though at the primary stage, this strategy would be promising for application in bone repair.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>The effect of biomaterials on stem cells</title><p>While many sources can be selected, the potential of different cells differs from one another. To induce the osteogenic differentiation of stem cells, a befitting; microenvironment is required. Ideal biomaterials for bone repair should have the following characteristics: (1) osteoconductivity, which can provide a place for blood vessel formation and bone ingrowth with a certain mechanical strength; (2) osteoinductivity, which can induce the expression of osteogenic proteins and stimulate surrounding stem cells to differentiate into chondrocytes or osteoblasts, followed by mineralization and calcification until new bone formation is achieved; and (3) osteogenesis, which can induce the differentiation of progenitor cells, osteoblasts, and bone progenitors into osteoblasts or their maturation. The interactions between bone biomaterials and stem cells include three steps: adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><sec><title>The adhesion and proliferation of stem cells</title><p>Cells, including stem cells, can sense multiple extracellular signals from their microenvironment and simultaneously convert them into coherent environmental signals to regulate cell behavior. Nonspecific adhesion generally occurs through van der Waals, ionic, and electrostatic forces. In comparison, specific adhesion is mediated by the ECM, including collagen I, fibronectin, peptides, growth factors, glucosamine, and other active molecules, and is induced by activating receptors on the surface of the cell membrane and transducing the chemical signal into the cell, thereby modulating a series of biological cellular activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib368">368</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib369">369</xref></sup> Bone biomaterials can affect the secretion of the ECM and act as an ECM to interact with stem cells.</p><p>The cell adhesion process consists of a series of cascaded reactions, which can be divided into four steps: cell adhesion, cell spreading, cytoskeletal organization, and the formation of focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib370">370</xref></sup> Initial adhesion plays a critical role in cell differentiation and long-term stability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib371">371</xref></sup> The initial adhesion between cells and biomaterials is mediated by ionic bonding or van der Waals forces, and the interaction is fast and transient. The adhesion promotes the interaction between the ECM and the integrin or transmembrane receptor, resulting in the formation of focal adhesion plaques. The cytoplasmic domain of the integrin receptor links to some adaptor proteins (for example, talin, vinculin, tensin, and paxillin), which further link to actin filaments. The ECM&#x02013;integrin&#x02013;cytoskeleton axis mediates the adhesion process, which not only regulates cell-biomaterial adhesion but is also responsible for the signal transduction from outside of the cell to within the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Integrins link the ECM with the cytoskeleton by focal adhesion components and activate focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src kinase. FAK phosphorylates two other groups, paxillin and Crk-associated substrate (p130cas), which enable the bonding of the signal adaptor protein with the focal adhesion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib372">372</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib373">373</xref></sup> This process is accompanied by actin assembly and FAK dynamic changes, which are involved in cell adhesion, spreading, invasion, proliferation, and apoptosis. Cell adhesion can also activate other intracellular signaling pathways, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib374 bib375 bib376">374&#x02013;376</xref></sup></p><p>Cell-ECM adhesion is mediated by the binding of ligands (including elastic fibers, collagen family members, proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans, and adhesive glycoproteins) to the integrin receptors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib370">370</xref></sup> Apart from the abovementioned ligands, the ECM also contains organic materials with excellent mechanical and biological properties. Currently, bioactive ceramics, as well as biodegradable polymers and biodegradable metals, are considered promising biomaterials in bone repair. As organic materials, biodegradable polymers can act as an ECM for cell attachment, and adhesion is promoted by combining the polymer with ligands.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib377">377</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib378">378</xref></sup> Natural polymers, such as albumin, alginate, amylose/amylopectin, chitosan, collagen, elastin, fibrin, fibronectin, hyaluronic acid, keratin, and silk, are applicable and can promote cell adhesion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib379">379</xref></sup> For better cell adhesion, polymers are often coated with fibronectin or laminin, while bioactive ceramics are often coated with collagen I/III or fibronectin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib380">380</xref></sup> It remains a technological challenge to prepare topographical gradients of inorganic biomaterials because of their inherent material properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib381">381</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib382">382</xref></sup> The use of biodegradable metals in direct contact with MSCs has not yet been reported.

Biomaterials mimicking the tissue-specific physicochemical properties of the ECM are being developed at a rapid pace to regulate stem cell fate. The activation of respective receptors responding to different ligands leads to the activation of different signaling pathways involved in the biomaterial-induced osteogenic differentiation of stem cells, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>.</p><sec><title>Transforming growth factor <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>/BMP pathway</title><p>BMPs have a high affinity for the type I receptor BMPR1A and a low affinity for the type II receptor BMPR2. Transforming growth factor &#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;) activates TGF-&#x003b2; signaling through binding to TGFBR2 and TGFBR1. The activation of these two receptor classes further promotes the phosphorylation of Smad proteins. TGF-&#x003b2; signaling has a complex effect on bone formation. It can induce synthesis of the ECM and promote the differentiation of osteoblasts; additionally, it is associated with the chemotaxis of osteoblast-like cells to the ECM and the recognition of target cells. BMPs were first isolated from a mineralized bone matrix extract, and they can induce the differentiation of the undifferentiated MSCs into bone cells, followed by collagen synthesis and calcified bone tissue formation. BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-5, and BMP-7 can effectively promote the differentiation of BMSCs into osteoblasts and induce bone formation; among them, BMP-2 exhibits the strongest activity. There are BMP receptors on the cell membrane. These receptors are activated by BMP binding or mechanical stimulation and then act on the downstream Smad protein in the cytoplasm. Smad protein is an intracellular signal transduction protein that was recently discovered. Among the family members, Smad1 and Smad5 are associated with osteoblast differentiation. Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 terminal serine residues are phosphorylated by BMP receptors, and then heterotrimers or heterodimers formed by 2 or 1 R-Smad and Smad4 enter the nucleus, activating osteoblast-specific transcription factors (RUNX2 and OSX) and corresponding downstream targets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib403">403</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib404">404</xref></sup> In fact, there are some applications of BMP-2 as an important cofactor to support bone regeneration on various scaffolds.

Wnt protein comprises a series of highly conserved secretory glycoproteins. A total of 19 members have been found, and the different members have unique secretory patterns and play different roles in embryonic development. Wnt protein is composed of 350&#x02013;380 amino acids and can be divided into classical Wnt proteins (Wnt1, Wnt2, Wnt3, and Wnt3a) and non-classical Wnt proteins (Wnt4, Wnt5a, Wnt5b, Wnt6, Wnt7a, and Wntl1, among others). The classical Wnt proteins interact with the Frizzled/LRP (Fzd/LRP) receptor and activate the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin classical pathway, while non-classical Wnt proteins bind to the Fzd receptor, activating heterotrimeric G protein and regulating the intracellular level of Ca ions. The combination of Wnt protein with the Fzd/LRP receptor activates the second messenger, causing the accumulation of cytoplasmic &#x003b2;-catenin. The accumulated &#x003b2;-catenin subsequently enters the nucleus and interacts with T cell transcription factor and lymphoid enhancer factor, which bind to the promoters of RUNX2 and OSX and activate their transcription.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib406">406</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>MAPK signaling pathway</title><p>Among the MAPK family members, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) are involved in the signal transduction of hMSC osteogenic differentiation. The ERK pathway can be activated throughout the development of stem cells and is closely related to cell proliferation and differentiation, while the p38 and JNK signaling pathways may play a role in the late stages of cell differentiation or apoptosis. The current mechanism of the ERK pathway is well defined. When in contact with osteoblast precursors, the ECM can bind with the integrin receptor of the cell surface and induce receptor dimerization, autophosphorylation, and FAK activation. As a result, FAK activates Ras, which further promotes transcription factors to initiate the expression of specific genes through conservative enzymatic cascades. It is known that ERK5 and ERK1/2 can activate the expression of the immediate early genes c-Fos and c-Jun.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib407">407</xref></sup> In addition, when hMSCs are added to the culture medium, the activity of ERK is activated after 7&#x02013;11 days, and the differentiation of hMSCs is promoted by c-Jun. JNK is activated after 13&#x02013;17 days, and ECM synthesis and calcium deposition increases. Other non-collagenous proteins, such as laminin 5 and matrix protein 3, can induce the expression of Cbfa-1 and ALP through the ERK1/2 signaling pathway and can enhance the matrix mineralization and osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib408">408</xref></sup> Together, these results suggest that the MAPK signaling pathway plays an important role in the osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs.</p></sec><sec><title>Hedgehog signaling pathway</title><p>The activation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway can promote the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs through the key downstream molecules Smoothened (Smo) and Gli1, and then activate mTORC2-Akt signaling by IGF.

These studies have focused on developing ideal biomaterials with a combination of satisfactory biological and mechanical properties, constructing a cell microenvironment with a multi-scale porous structure, and inducing the oriented differentiation of stem cells for artificial-to-biological transformation.</p><p>Regarding bone biomaterials, recent studies have focused on bioactive and/or biodegradable biomaterials, including bioactive ceramics, biodegradable polymers, and biodegradable metals. Bioactive ceramics have inorganic constituents similar to those of natural bone and possess excellent biocompatibility and bioactivity. However, their inherent brittleness and low toughness limit their application in bone repair. In comparison, biodegradable polymers possess a relatively high toughness and plasticity, and their performance can be modulated by molecular design and fabrication methods. However, there is a contradiction between the mechanical properties and degradation rate, while synthetic biodegradable polymers always have a poor cell affinity and much lower strength than natural bone. As biodegradable metals, biomedical Mg and its alloys are stronger than biodegradable polymers and tougher than bioactive ceramics. However, the rapid loss of mechanical integrity and the accumulation of corrosion products caused by rapid degradation have long been major problems for Mg and its alloys. Therefore, a single type of bone biomaterial can hardly meet the multiple requirements for application in bone repair. To meet the requirements of both the mechanical and biological properties, many researchers have tried to combine different types of bone biomaterials, hoping to combine the advantages of each biomaterial while overcoming their disadvantages.</p><p>As for the cell microenvironment, although many of its specific biological functions are still unclear, attempts to mimic the microenvironment by designing bone biomaterials with a porous structure have continued. Especially in recent years, the construction of a cell microenvironment has become a common focus of multiple disciplines, including engineering, medical, and materials sciences. On the one hand, there is a basic agreement about the functions of different pore diameters, and the relationship between the porous structure of bone biomaterials and cell behavior has been experimentally studied. However, the mechanisms of energy interactions and functions of the porous structure with respect to cells/tissues remain unclear. Related studies have focused on a single-scale porous structure, but the formation mechanism of a cell microenvironment with a multi-scale porous structure remains to be studied. On the other hand, in consideration of the different characteristics of bone biomaterials, various methods have been developed to prepare porous structures, including gas foaming and freeze-drying, among others. These methods can prepare materials with pore diameters ranging from hundreds of micrometers to nanometers but often lack control over the porous structure. The development of rapid prototyping resolves the above problems to a large extent, as it can be used to precisely control the pore diameter, porosity, and pore interconnectivity of bone biomaterials. However, it is limited by the available types and compositions of raw materials; additionally, it is difficult to prepare a submicro- and nanoscale porous structure. Therefore, the porous structures developed so far remain largely different from that of natural bone.</p><p>With the development of new stem cell-based techniques, there are many more choices of seed stem cells for bone repair, such as iPSCs and transdifferentiation-derived osteoblasts. However, the tumorigenic potential, limited sources, and low transdifferentiation efficiency of iPSCs are the main challenges surrounding their application. There are still many obstacles to overcome. In comparison, the potential of several MSCs, such as DPSCs and UC-MSCs, is encouraging, as they have rich sources, noninvasive harvesting techniques, and excellent self-renewal and proliferative capacities. Although the detailed molecular mechanisms regarding how bone biomaterials induce the osteogenic differentiation of stem cells are still largely unknown, some evidence has demonstrated that associated signaling pathways may be involved in the process. For example, the P ions dissolved from bone biomaterials can be absorbed by stem cells to form ATP metabolites, which send signals to stem cells and induce osteogenic differentiation. The release of Mg and Sr ions from bone biomaterials could enhance osteogenic differentiation through promoting the concentration of CGRP and activating the BMP signaling pathway, respectively.</p><p>Notwithstanding the intensive efforts and great achievements behind biomaterials and their interactions with stem cells, the bone biomaterials developed thus far still have some deficiencies, and there is plenty of room for improvement: (1) develop new preparation methods for bone biomaterials from the perspectives of histology, cytology, and molecular biology. According to different needs, filter the prepared bone biomaterials and seek the optimal combination; subsequently, develop composite bone biomaterials with satisfactory biological and mechanical properties. (2) Explore the mechanisms of energy interaction and functions of the porous structure with cells/tissues at the molecular level; reveal the formation mechanism of the microenvironment with the synergistic effect of the multi-scale porous structure; seek the optimal composition of a multi-scale porous structure, and thus provide theoretical guidance for the design and manufacture of the porous structure. (3) Develop cross-scale methods for preparing the multi-scale porous structure; the combination of several methods is a promising direction for preparing porous bone biomaterials. (4) Develop novel surface micro/nanostructures for bone biomaterials to improve their ability to provide biochemical signals for cells, thereby facilitating the oriented differentiation of stem cells and achieving artificial-to-biological transformation. (5) The molecular mechanism of stem cell lineage commitment by biomaterials has not been well defined. Thus, further efforts should be made to elucidate the differentiation mechanisms and seek novel biomaterials with better osteoinductivity. In summary, developing bone biomaterials with material compositions, geometric structures, and physiological functions similar to those of natural bone and investigating their interactions with stem cells for bone repair remain significant avenues for future research.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the following funds: (1) the Natural Science Foundation of China (51575537, 81572577, and 51705540); (2) the Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (2016JJ1027); (3) the Project of Innovation-driven Plan of Central South University (2016CX023); (4) the Open-End Fund for the Valuable and Precision Instruments of Central South University; (5) the Fund of the State Key Laboratory of Solidification Processing in NWPU (SKLSP201605); (6) the National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents (BX201700291); and (7) the Project of State Key Laboratory of High Performance Complex Manufacturing, Central South University.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="bib1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">Lu H, Liu Y, Guo J et al. <article-title>Biomaterials with antibacterial and osteoinductive properties to repair infected bone defects</article-title>. <source>Int J Mol Sci</source>

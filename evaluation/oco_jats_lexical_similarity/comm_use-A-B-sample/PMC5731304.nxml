associate editor of the Texas Heart Institute Journal, pointed out five crucial
components that make a successful medical journal: 1) financial security; 2) an
ample, competent, and experienced editorial staff; 3) reliable manuscript reviewers;
4) equality of submissions, and; 5) responsive readers. In addition, one more
fundamental component could be added, which would represent cardiac surgery, the
ideas and contributions of the country. We are trying to follow these components to
improve the excellence of our Brazilian Journal of Cardiovascular Surgery (BJCVS),
encouraging the realization of substantial trials.</p></sec><sec><title>A Great "Trial"</title><p>The latest Sociedade Brasileira de Cirurgia Cardiovascular/Brazilian Society of
Cardiovascular Surgery (SBCCV) newsletter (April 2017) highlights a consensus
published by the American Heart Association (AHA) for the use of appropriate
criteria for myocardial revascularization in stable angina<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. This consensus is an update of the
2012 document, now divided into two publications, one referring to acute and present
coronary syndrome. Unlike a standard guideline, this Consensus brings more than 60
real clinical settings, scored by a panel of 32 experts among clinicians,
interventionists, and surgeons. The clinical, anatomical and functional
characteristics were contemplated, and innovatively, the treatment with one or more
antianginal drugs weighed in the intervention decision. This approach may be useful
for an unambiguous standardization to correct regional discrepancies when, for
example, EuroSCORE and STS are used. The Brazilian cardiac surgery, although it has
high international prestige (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>), never
performed a great "trial." For this reason, the coronary artery bypass grafting
without cardiopulmonary bypass would be chosen, since its introduction in the
surgical practice was carried out by Dr. Enio Buffolo (in Brazil) and Dr. Federico
Benetti (in Argentina).</p><p>

haemoglobinuria (PNH) is characterized by chronic, uncontrolled complement activation resulting in elevated intravascular haemolysis and morbidities, including fatigue, dyspnoea, abdominal pain, pulmonary hypertension, thrombotic events (TEs) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The long-term safety and efficacy of eculizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits terminal complement activation, was investigated in 195 patients over 66 months. Four patient deaths were reported, all unrelated to treatment, resulting in a 3-year survival estimate of 97&#x000b7;6%. All patients showed a reduction in lactate dehydrogenase levels, which was sustained over the course of treatment (median reduction of 86&#x000b7;9% at 36 months), reflecting inhibition of chronic haemolysis. TEs decreased by 81&#x000b7;8%, with 96&#x000b7;4% of patients remaining free of TEs. Patients also showed a time-dependent improvement in renal function: 93&#x000b7;1% of patients exhibited improvement or stabilization in CKD score at 36 months. Transfusion independence increased by 90&#x000b7;0% from baseline, with the number of red blood cell units transfused decreasing by 54&#x000b7;7%. Eculizumab was well tolerated, with no evidence of cumulative toxicity and a decreasing occurrence of adverse events over time. Eculizumab has a substantial impact on the symptoms and complications of PNH and results a significant improvement in patient survival.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>eculizumab</kwd><kwd>paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria</kwd><kwd>phase III</kwd><kwd>long-term therapy</kwd><kwd>haemolysis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare, progressive and life-threatening haematopoietic stem cell disorder. It is characterized by complement-mediated intravascular haemolysis and a prothrombotic state (Brodsky, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2009</xref>; Hillmen <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">2010</xref>). PNH may be diagnosed in patients of all ages, but the median age is in patients in their early 30s (Soci&#x000e9; <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">1996</xref>; Nishimura <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">2004</xref>). Despite best historical supportive care, including transfusions and anticoagulation management, PNH is fatal in approximately 35% of patients within 5 years of diagnosis (Hillmen <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">1995</xref>; Soci&#x000e9; <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">1996</xref>; Kelly <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">2011</xref>).</p><p>The disease arises from a somatic mutation in the phosphatidylinositol glycan class A gene (<italic>PIGA</italic>), which disrupts synthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI), a molecule that anchors proteins to cell membranes (Takeda <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">1993</xref>). The mutation results in the reduction or complete absence of the GPI-anchored complement regulatory proteins CD55 and CD59, which renders the cells sensitive to complement-mediated destruction (Rother <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">2005</xref>; Kelly <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">2009</xref>). All blood cells are susceptible to complement-mediated attack, although red blood cells are the most susceptible to lysis (Parker, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">1991</xref>; Pu &#x00026; Brodsky, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">2011</xref>).</p><p>Complement activation in PNH is manifested as chronic haemolysis that leads to the release of free haemoglobin and the subsequent depletion of nitric oxide. Consumption of nitric oxide leads to vaso-occlusion and platelet activation and results in the common morbidities seen in PNH, such as fatigue, dyspnoea, recurrent abdominal pain, dysphagia, chest pain and pulmonary hypertension. More importantly, chronic haemolysis renders PNH patients at a greater risk of thrombotic events (TEs), renal insufficiency and other organ damage, and premature mortality. Compared with the general population, patients with PNH have a 62-fold higher risk of a TE (McKeage, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">2011</xref>) and a six-fold greater risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) (Hillmen <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">2010</xref>). TEs have been reported to account for up to 67% of PNH-related deaths (Hillmen <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">2007</xref>), while CKD has been reported to account for 8&#x02013;18% of disease-related mortality (Clark <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">1981</xref>; Nishimura <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">2004</xref>).</p><p>Historically, supportive care measures used in PNH, such as transfusions, anticoagulation or long-term use of steroids and pain medication, leave patients with a poor quality of life and are associated with adverse events. In addition, supportive care measures do not prevent the occurrence of catastrophic events, such as thromboses and CKD, that have recently been associated with elevated risk of premature mortality (Hillmen <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">2010</xref>; Rother <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">2005</xref>; Brodsky <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">2008</xref>; de Latour <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">2009</xref>; Hill <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">2010</xref>; Kelly <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">2011</xref>).</p><p>Eculizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, inhibits the terminal complement cascade by binding uniquely to human complement protein C5, thereby inhibiting the formation of pro-inflammatory, prothrombotic C5a, and C5b, with subsequent inhibition of assembly of the membrane attack complex (Hillmen <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">2006</xref>; Brodsky <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">2008</xref>). Although eculizumab suppresses the terminal complement system, the proximal complement system, responsible for opsonization of microorganisms and clearance of immune complexes, remains intact and fully functional (Rother <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">2007</xref>). A series of multinational clinical trials demonstrated that eculizumab therapy is well tolerated, leads to a rapid and clinically significant reduction in intravascular haemolysis and, thus, provides substantial clinical benefits (Hillmen <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">2010</xref>; Rother <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">2005</xref>; Brodsky <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">2008</xref>; Hill <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">2010</xref>). By inhibiting terminal complement activation and intravascular haemolysis, treatment with eculizumab significantly reduces TEs (Hillmen <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">2007</xref>), transfusion requirements (Hillmen <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">2006</xref>) and pulmonary hypertension (Hill <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">2012</xref>) and significantly improves renal function (Hillmen <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">2010</xref>), gastrointestinal pain (Hill <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">2005a</xref>) and patient quality of life (Hillmen <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">2006</xref>).</p><p>Clinical benefit occurs rapidly in patients with PNH following the initiation of eculizumab. Here we report on continuous administration of eculizumab (for up to 66 months) and the impact of long-term therapy on clinical outcomes in PNH. In addition, we provide greater insight into the safety profile of long-term eculizumab therapy for PNH.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design and patients</title><p>This manuscript reports on the long-term safety and efficacy of eculizumab in 195 patients with haemolytic PNH who had participated in one of three prospective parent trials: the Phase II pilot study (Hillmen <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">2004</xref>; Hill <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">2005b</xref>) and its extensions, the Phase III TRIUMPH (Transfusion Reduction Efficacy and Safety Clinical Investigation, a Randomized, Multicenter, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Using Eculizumab in Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria) study (NCT00122330) (Hillmen <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">2006</xref>), or the Phase III SHEPHERD (Safety in Hemolytic PNH Patients Treated With Eculizumab: A Multi-Center Open-Label Research Design) study (NCT00130000) (Hillmen <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">2007</xref>; Brodsky <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">2008</xref>). At the end of these initial studies, 187 of the 195 patients (95&#x000b7;9%) enrolled in an open-label extension study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig 1</xref>). All patients had a minimum of 10% PNH red blood cells at enrolment in the parent trials and were vaccinated with a meningococcal vaccine at least 14 d before the first eculizumab infusion in the parent studies. It was recommended that all patients be revaccinated at intervals of between 2&#x000b7;5 and 3 years, with meningococcal vaccine titre assays collected prior to and within 1&#x02013;2 months of the revaccination. All three parent trials employed the same dosing regimen: 600-mg infusions of eculizumab every week for 4 weeks, followed 1 week later by a single 900-mg dose, and then a maintenance dose of 900 mg every 14 (&#x000b1;2) days until the end of the study. In the extension study patients continued to receive the maintenance dose of eculizumab.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Fig 1</label><caption><p>Phase II and III PNH clinical trials overview.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bjh0162-0062-f1"/></fig><p>The first clinical investigation of eculizumab was an open-label, 12-week, Phase II pilot study that enrolled 11 patients at two UK study centres, all of whom continued into two extension studies: the first of 52 weeks duration and the second of 104 weeks duration. The positive outcomes from this study (Hillmen <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">2007</xref>) resulted in the initiation of two pivotal phase III studies.</p><p>The first pivotal study, TRIUMPH, was a 26-week, double-blind placebo-controlled trial that included 87 patients randomized to either eculizumab (<italic>n</italic> = 43) or placebo (<italic>n</italic> = 44) (Hillmen <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">2006</xref>). Patients were required to have had at least four transfusions during the previous 6 months for anaemia or anaemia-related symptoms, platelet counts &#x02265; 100 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/l and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels &#x02265; 1&#x000b7;5-fold the upper limit of the normal range.</p><p>The open-label, single-arm SHEPHERD trial lasted 52 weeks and included 97 patients. The patient eligibility criteria for this study were broadened to include patients with fewer transfusion requirements (as low as one transfusion within 24 months prior to initiating eculizumab treatment) and more severe bone marrow dysfunction (platelet counts as low as 30 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/l) (Hillmen <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">2007</xref>; Brodsky <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">2008</xref>).</p><p>The long-term extension study comprised a 104-week treatment period and a 16-week post-treatment follow-up period for any patients who terminated treatment early. Patients who completed the 2-year long-term extension before eculizumab was commercially available or accessible were allowed to continue receiving the investigational product until the drug was approved in their country.</p></sec><sec><title>Study endpoints</title><p>Efficacy assessments were performed at least every 2 weeks from the time of initiation of eculizumab therapy in the parent study. Efficacy measures included patient survival, degree of haemolysis (as measured by blood LDH levels), TE incidence rate, mean change from baseline in haemoglobin and the number of units of transfused packed red blood cells (PRBCs) administered. Assessments of renal function were performed over the duration of the study by determining the CKD stage using formulas for estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) developed by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study Group (Levey <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">1999</xref>; Stevens <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">2006</xref>). Specifically, stage 0 was defined as GFR &#x0003e;90 ml/min/1&#x000b7;73 m<sup>2</sup> with no evidence of kidney damage; stage 1 as GFR &#x0003e;90 ml/min/1&#x000b7;73 m<sup>2</sup> with evidence of kidney damage; stage 2 as GFR 60&#x02013;90 ml/min/1&#x000b7;73 m<sup>2</sup> with evidence of kidney damage (proteinurea assessed by dipstick or abnormal imaging findings); stage 3 as GFR 30&#x02013;60 ml/min/1&#x000b7;73 m<sup>2</sup>; stage 4 as GFR 15&#x02013;30 ml/min/1&#x000b7;73 m<sup>2</sup>; and stage 5 as GFR &#x0003c;15 ml/min/1&#x000b7;73 m<sup>2</sup>. The number of transfusion-independent, compared with transfusion-dependent, patients was assessed over time. The baseline period was defined as the 6 months prior to the initiation of eculizumab. At treatment evaluation, transfusion-independent patients were defined as those who did not require a blood transfusion during the previous 6 months, and transfusion-dependent patients had received at least one blood transfusion in the previous 6 months.</p><p>Safety assessments included solicited monitoring of adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory tests and vital signs. AEs were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (<sc>meddra</sc>&#x000ae;) version 6.1, with AEs relating to infection and infection-related serious AEs (SAEs) tabulated separately consistent with the expanded MedDRA preferred terms (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.meddramsso.com">http://www.meddramsso.com</ext-link>). In addition, all AEs were reviewed for events that could potentially be related to an infection and classified accordingly. AEs were assessed for severity and classified as mild (events requiring minimal or no treatment and not interfering with the patient's daily activities), moderate (events resulting in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures and possibly causing some interference with functioning) or severe (events that are usually incapacitating and interrupting usual daily activities that may require systemic drug therapy or other treatment).</p><p>An SAE was defined as any event that resulted in death, was immediately life threatening, required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or was a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that did not result in death or require hospitalization and were not life threatening may have been considered SAEs if, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed previously.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Baseline was defined as the pre-eculizumab value collected from the parent study, except for those patients in the TRIUMPH study who received placebo where baseline was the value collected at the final visit of this study. Least-squares mean changes from baseline in LDH levels were analysed using a repeated-measure analysis of variance model, including time of treatment, parent study and parent study treatment as fixed effects. The signed-rank test was used to analyse mean changes from baseline in haemoglobin. Change in CKD stage was analysed using the Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel chi-squared test. An improvement in renal function was defined as a categorical documented reduction in CKD stage, and a worsening in renal function was defined as a categorical documented increase in CKD stage.</p><p>Comparisons of the reporting of AEs by patients during the first 26 weeks of treatment with eculizumab and the last 26 weeks of treatment were tested using a one-tailed exact McNemar test using matched-pairs data. For any patient who remained in the study for &#x0003c;52 weeks, the incidence of AEs reported during the first 26 weeks of treatment was compared with the incidence of AEs from 26 weeks + 1 d until the patient's last dose of eculizumab.</p><p>Two patient populations were identified for statistical analyses. All patients who had completed at least 26 weeks of randomized treatment in one of the parent studies and had received at least one dose of eculizumab in the extension study were included in the safety population; patients from this population who had no major protocol violations were included in the per-protocol population. All analyses were performed on an intent-to-treat basis.

Of the patients included in this 36-month cut-off, the overall median treatment duration was 30&#x000b7;3 months, with a range of 10&#x000b7;0&#x02013;66&#x000b7;1 months (interquartile range: 26&#x000b7;2&#x02013;33&#x000b7;1 months). During maintenance dosing, 21 patients (10&#x000b7;8%) deviated from the protocol dosing interval by receiving treatment &#x0003c;12 d apart on at least one occasion. Of the original 195 patients, 19 patients (9&#x000b7;7%) discontinued treatment over a period of 66 months: nine discontinued because of an AE (see &#x02018;Safety&#x02019;), seven withdrew consent, two were discontinued based on the decision of the investigator and one was noncompliant with the protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig 1</xref>). Eight of the discontinuations (six withdrawn consents and two AEs) occurred during a parent trial, and the remaining 11 discontinuations (seven AEs, two investigator's decision, one withdrawn consent, one non-compliance) occurred during the long-term extension study.</p></sec><sec><title>Intravascular haemolysis</title><p>All patients showed a rapid decrease from baseline in serum LDH, a marker for intravascular haemolysis, which was generally sustained with continued treatment, although throughout the course of the study some patients did have transient increases in LDH. Prior to the first administration of eculizumab, median LDH concentration was 2129 u/l (range: 499&#x02013;10 300 u/l; upper limit of normal: 223 u/l).

Following the first dose of eculizumab, trough concentrations &#x0003c;35 &#x003bc;g/ml were observed in 49 of 135 patients (36&#x000b7;3%) with available samples. Overall, 36 of these 49 patients (73&#x000b7;5%) exhibited haemolysis as measured by a validated pharmacodynamic assay (haemolysis &#x0003e;20%). Multiple occurrences of trough eculizumab concentrations &#x0003c;35 &#x003bc;g/ml were observed in 14 of 140 reviewed patients (10&#x000b7;0%). These patients generally had more rapid eculizumab clearance (&#x0003e;0&#x000b7;4 ml/h/kg) or shorter eculizumab half-life (&#x0003c;130 h) than the respective median values of the trial populations as a whole.</p><p>None of the patients with breakthrough haemolysis discontinued treatment with eculizumab. In seven of the 14 patients (50&#x000b7;0%), the breakthrough haemolysis was successfully mitigated, as evidenced by reductions in LDH concentrations, by decreasing the eculizumab dosing interval to &#x0003c;14 d. None of these patients experienced SAEs relating to haemolysis. In the whole population, 21 of 195 patients (10&#x000b7;8%) had a median of 22 decreases (range: 3&#x02013;124) in dosing intervals.</p></sec><sec><title>Haemoglobin levels and transfusion requirements</title><p>Treatment with eculizumab resulted in a steady increase in the serum haemoglobin concentration from baseline (93&#x000b7;7 g/l), including a mean increase from baseline of 5&#x000b7;5 g/l (range: &#x02212;32&#x000b7;0 to 55&#x000b7;0 g/l) to 99&#x000b7;2 g/l after 2 weeks of treatment and 10&#x000b7;4 g/l (range: &#x02212;42&#x000b7;0 to 81&#x000b7;0 g/l) to 104&#x000b7;7 g/l by 24 months, which was maintained at 36 months (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table II</xref>). The percentage of patients who achieved transfusion independence increased with sustained treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig 3</xref>).

Fourteen of 78 patients (17&#x000b7;9%) continued to require transfusions between months 30 and 36.

These TEs included deep-vein thrombosis, hepatic vein (Budd-Chiari syndrome), cerebrovascular accident, mesenteric thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The percentage of patients free from TEs increased from 67&#x000b7;7% before treatment to 96&#x000b7;4% during treatment: seven patients (3&#x000b7;6%) reported a total of 10 TEs over 467&#x000b7;1 patient-years. Of these seven patients, five had a history of TEs prior to starting treatment with eculizumab and four were receiving concomitant anticoagulation therapy (including warfarin and low-molecular-weight heparins). Of the 10 TEs reported during eculizumab treatment, five were reported as thrombophlebitis/deep vein thrombosis (three events occurred in the same patient), one as deep vein thrombosis, one as retinal vein thrombosis and one as a possible thrombosis in a fistula. The remaining patient experienced portal vein thrombosis and splenic infarcts. The median time from the first dose of eculizumab to the first TE was 646 d (approximately 21 months), with a range of 170&#x02013;876 d (approximately 5&#x000b7;6&#x02013;29&#x000b7;0 months).</p><p>A time-matched analysis showed that in the 467&#x000b7;1 patient-years prior to eculizumab treatment, there were a total of 52 TEs reported in 25 patients. The administration of eculizumab reduced the TE incidence rate from 11&#x000b7;13 events per 100 patient-years to 2&#x000b7;14 events per 100 patient-years, a relative reduction of 81&#x000b7;8% (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0&#x000b7;0005).</p><p>Overall, 98 patients (50&#x000b7;3%) were treated with anticoagulants prior to or coincident with eculizumab: 11 patients before the start of the study, 84 patients both before and during treatment with eculizumab and three patients during the study following a TE. Of the 95 patients who were treated with an anticoagulant prior to the start of the study, 58 (61&#x000b7;1%) experienced at least one TE before receiving eculizumab. Eleven patients, six of whom had a prior history of TEs, discontinued anticoagulant therapy while receiving eculizumab. None of these 11 patients experienced a TE after discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Chronic kidney disease</title><p>Chronic kidney disease stages (National Kidney Foundation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">2002</xref>) were assessed following each 6-month eculizumab treatment period. Previous reports on this patient population have demonstrated that prior to eculizumab treatment, 64% of patients had evidence of CKD (Hillmen <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">2010</xref>). There was a time-dependent improvement in renal function. The percentage of patients showing improvement, worsening or no change in CKD was 25&#x000b7;4%, 6&#x000b7;1% and 68&#x000b7;5% respectively, at 6 months compared with 44&#x000b7;8%, 6&#x000b7;9% and 48&#x000b7;3% respectively, at 36 months. Overall, following 36 months of treatment with eculizumab, 93&#x000b7;1% of patients showed either an improvement or stabilization in CKD, and patients were significantly more likely to experience an improvement than a worsening in renal function (<italic>P</italic> = 0&#x000b7;015).</p></sec><sec><title>Patient survival</title><p>Four of the 195 patients died while on eculizumab treatment; the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier estimate of patient survival at 36 months was 97&#x000b7;6% [95% confidence interval (CI), 93&#x000b7;7&#x02013;99&#x000b7;1%], which was sustained out to 66 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig 4</xref>). Mean duration of therapy with eculizumab was 399 d (range: 60&#x02013;720 d). Three deaths were caused by concomitant conditions: chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia in a 71-year-old patient who had a history of myelodysplasia and died after 208 d of eculizumab therapy; metastases of pre-existing stomach adenocarcinoma in a 63-year-old patient who died after 609 d of therapy; and cerebral herniation in a 31-year-old patient who died after 60 d of therapy. During in-patient care for a pulmonary embolism, following a series of hospitalizations for a disc prolapse, pneumonia and renal failure, the patient started hyperventilating with his pupils becoming dilated. A computerized tomography scan of the brain revealed a marked left hemorrhagic cerebral arterial media infarct with clear signs of cerebral herniation and the start of cerebrospinal fluid block. The last assessment of LDH levels, almost 4 weeks prior to the event, were below the patient's chronic baseline haemolytic state, leading the investigator to conclude that no serious haemolysis was present at that time.</p><fig id="fig04" position="float"><label>Fig 4</label><caption><p>Long-term survival with eculizumab therapy.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bjh0162-0062-f4"/></fig><p>The fourth patient, a 35-year-old with unconfirmed aplastic anaemia who had received therapy for 720 d, experienced an arteriovenous thrombosis of the small bowel.

This patient had received a quradivalent vaccine against serotypes A, C, W135 and Y. The infection was successfully treated with several antibiotics, including imipenem, vancomycin, ceftriaxone and penicillin; the range of antibiotics used was because of bacterial sensitivity and the resistance pattern in the local hospital flora. This patient remained in the study and continued to receive eculizumab. The other case occurred in a 54-year-old female patient 416 d after eculizumab treatment was initiated and was due to serotype Y or W135 (further serotyping was not possible in this patient's country). This patient had been vaccinated against serotypes A and C.

Of note, neither of the patients with meningococcal sepsis had received vaccination against the specific strain of their infection, at the time of the infections serum bactericidal antibody values were within an appropriate range and both infections resolved with treatment and without sequelae. In neither case was the meningococceal infection due to failure of the vaccine.</p><p>All AEs coded as pyrexia were considered related to infection even if an identifiable infection was not diagnosed at the time of the fever. Overall, there were 38 events of pyrexia reported in 22 patients, the majority of which (26 of 38; 68&#x000b7;4%) were mild in severity, whereas only three of 38 events (7&#x000b7;9%) were considered severe. As previously mentioned, nine patients (4&#x000b7;6%) had pyrexia events reported as SAEs, which included all the events considered to be severe.

Peripheral oedema, pruritus and rash were the most frequently reported AEs of this type, each occurring in a total of 20 patients (10&#x000b7;3%). None of the AEs associated with treatment infusion resulted in the discontinuation of eculizumab.</p><p>In order to investigate if long-term treatment with eculizumab increased the incidence of any individual or category of AE or whether eculizumab was associated with cumulative toxicity, the incidence of AEs (irrespective of relation to treatment) reported during the first 26 weeks of eculizumab treatment was compared with the last 26 weeks of treatment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table V</xref>).

The median eculizumab treatment duration was 30&#x000b7;3 months, with a maximum duration of 66 months. Inhibition of terminal complement activity with eculizumab has previously been reported to rapidly and significantly reduce chronic haemolysis, leading to reductions in transfusion requirements (Hillmen <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">2006</xref>) and TEs (Hillmen <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">2007</xref>), as well as improvements in renal function (Hillmen <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">2010</xref>). The current study shows that these results are sustained with long-term treatment.</p><p>Thrombotic events are a severe and life-threatening complication of PNH and are reportedly the most frequent cause of death in patients with PNH (Hillmen <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">2007</xref>). TE has been shown to be a significant risk factor for early mortality (relative risk: 15&#x000b7;4; 95% CI, 9&#x000b7;3&#x02013;25&#x000b7;4; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0&#x000b7;001) in untreated patients (de Latour <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">2008</xref>). Furthermore, following the occurrence of a first TE, there is a greater risk of subsequent TEs, which places patients with a history of TE at a heightened risk of premature mortality (Nishimura <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">2004</xref>; de Latour <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">2008</xref>). Given that TE in PNH patients appears to be related to severe and ongoing uncontrolled terminal complement activation, management of TE is difficult in PNH patients, as many continue to report TE despite prophylactic use of anticoagulation therapies (Moyo <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">2004</xref>; de Latour <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">2008</xref>; Kelly <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">2011</xref>). We observed an 81&#x000b7;8% reduction in the incidence of TEs with long-term eculizumab treatment. Eighty-four patients in this study received concomitant anticoagulant therapy, which was discontinued in 11 patients. Despite six of these 11 patients having a history of TE, none of them experienced a TE following withdrawal of anticoagulation therapy while receiving eculizumab alone. This experience is consistent with other reports (Emadi &#x00026; Brodsky, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">2009</xref>; Kelly <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">2011</xref>).</p><p>Thrombotic events were observed in 16% (3 of 19) of patients who discontinued treatment with eculizumab, all within 8 weeks of taking their last dose. This finding highlights the importance of adherence to eculizumab treatment at the recommended dose and schedule over the long term, as continuous therapy is paramount in maintaining sustained inhibition of the underlying uncontrolled terminal complement activation. If discontinuation of eculizumab therapy becomes necessary, the potential risk of thrombosis as well as possible preventive measures should be considered.</p><p>Chronic kidney disease in PNH patients is caused by several factors, including chronic exposure to free haemoglobin, which increases renal accumulation of haemosiderin, tubulointerstitial inflammation and kidney damage (Nath <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">2001</xref>). Renal impairment is known to progress over time (Hillmen <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">2010</xref>) and is associated with an increase in mortality (Kim <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">2011</xref>). Continued improvement in CKD was observed with sustained eculizumab treatment, with 44&#x000b7;8% of patients showing improvement after 36 months of treatment, compared with 24&#x000b7;4% showing improvement in CKD after only 6 months of treatment. The improvement in renal function in all nine patients with early-stage CKD (stage 1&#x02013;2) over 36 months suggests that patients treated with eculizumab at earlier stages of kidney damage have a greater likelihood of improvement in renal function, and there is evidence that sustained long-term therapy with eculizumab can reverse early stage renal damage sustained prior to treatment initiation. These are unique findings in a patient population known to be at risk for progressive decline in renal function (Hillmen <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">2010</xref>), and they suggest that eculizumab may have a protective role that can lead to improvement in, or less progression of, renal disease.</p><p>Reduction in the incidence of TE and CKD, the two major causes of death in PNH, by administration of eculizumab would be expected to lead to improved patient survival. In the current prospective, multinational study in a large cohort of 195 patients, we demonstrated a patient survival of 97&#x000b7;6% (95% CI, 93&#x000b7;7%&#x02013;99&#x000b7;1%) at 3 years, which was maintained over 66 months of eculizumab treatment. This result is similar to the 5-year survival rate of 95&#x000b7;5% observed in a single-centre, retrospective analysis of 79 patients (Kelly <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">2011</xref>). These survival rates seen with eculizumab therapy are a substantial improvement over historical 5-year survival rates of approximately 65% in PNH patients with evidence of haemolysis (Hillmen <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">1995</xref>; Kelly <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">2011</xref>) and are similar to survival rates of age- and sex-matched healthy subjects (Kelly <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">2011</xref>). These results further emphasize the role of uncontrolled complement activation in the pathophysiology of PNH-related mortality.</p><p>Long-term treatment with eculizumab also resulted in sustained haematological improvement in patients. Transfusion independence was achieved by 52% (102 of 195) of patients within the first 6 months of treatment, which increased to 82% by the last 6 months of treatment. The number of units of PRBCs transfused was reduced by 55% over the 36-month period. In addition, there was a continuous improvement in haemoglobin levels, which was achieved despite the reduction in transfusions.</p><p>The standard eculizumab maintenance dose of 900 mg every 14 &#x000b1; 2 d was sufficient to maintain inhibition of haemolysis in 89% of patients. In the 21 patients who did report breakthrough haemolysis, shortening the dosing interval to &#x0003c;14 d was sufficient to maintain inhibition of haemolysis, and none of these patients discontinued treatment because of a lack of therapeutic effect. It is important that patients be monitored for any signs or symptoms of breakthrough haemolysis so that the dosing can be adjusted accordingly or, in cases of persistent breakthroughs, to ensure the patient has not developed human anti-human antibodies (HAHA) or neutralizing antibodies to eculizumab. Subsequent to the end of the study, a more sensitive analysis became available for the identification of HAHA in patients receiving eculizumab. With this new analysis, two of the patients in the long-term extension study were found to have low positive values for neutralizing antibodies, which exceeded the prespecified threshold for the <italic>in vitro</italic> assay (data not shown). This finding had no impact on the clinical response to eculizumab therapy or on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of eculizumab, which continued to block complement activity.</p><p>Eculizumab was well tolerated over the long term and demonstrated a positive safety profile. Although nearly all patients reported at least one AE, this is to be expected considering the duration of the study; importantly, discontinuation from treatment due to a nonfatal AE was seen in only five patients (2&#x000b7;6%) over the entire period of study. With no comparator group in this open-label extension, we compared the AE rate of the early treatment group with that of the later treatment group to understand the risk of long-term eculizumab treatment. The probability of a patient experiencing one or more AEs was significantly lower in the last 6 months of the eculizumab treatment period than in the first 6 months of therapy. This suggests that there is no cumulative toxicity with long-term administration of eculizumab and that the risk&#x02013;benefit profile of eculizumab improves with extended use. Serious infection-related AEs were observed throughout the study, although there was no evidence that their occurrence was related to time on eculizumab treatment.</p><p>There is an increased incidence of infections with <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> in individuals with genetic deficiencies of C5&#x02013;C9 (Figueroa &#x00026; Densen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">1991</xref>). Thus, blocking terminal complement activity with eculizumab increases a patient's susceptibility to meningococcal infections. Two cases of meningococcal sepsis were reported during the approximately 467 patient-years of exposure to eculizumab. Both patients were successfully treated without sequelae. Patient education on the signs and symptoms of potential meningococcal infections remains important to ensure that any infections are identified as quickly as possible. This is particularly crucial outside of a closely monitored clinical study, where continuous vigilance and proactive antibiotic treatment are essential to avoid a potentially fatal infection (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://soliris.net/sites/default/files/assets/soliris_pi.pdf">http://soliris.net/sites/default/files/assets/soliris_pi.pdf</ext-link>).</p><p>In conclusion, long-term treatment with eculizumab resulted in sustained improvement in patient outcomes by rapidly reducing haemolysis and significantly reducing the frequency of severe and life-threatening morbidities, such as TEs and CKD, and thus, improving patient survival. There was evidence that eculizumab improved kidney function over time and also provided sustained protection against further renal damage, particularly when administered early and prior to advanced renal impairment. Eculizumab therapy was well tolerated with a favourable safety profile; very few patients discontinued treatment during long-term therapy. Over the course of this study, survival rates were high and consistent with the improvements observed in another overlapping cohort of patients in whom survival was seen to be similar to age- and sex-matched normal control subjects (Kelly <italic>et al</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">2011</xref>). The International PNH Registry (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnhregistry.com">www.pnhregistry.com</ext-link>) is providing further opportunities to continue studying and understanding the long-term benefits of eculizumab in patients with PNH outside the clinical trial setting.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

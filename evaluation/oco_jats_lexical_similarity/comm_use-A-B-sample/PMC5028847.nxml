Our previous study demonstrated that nanotube modification of the implant surface, together with nanotubes loaded with quaternized chitosan (hydroxypropyltrimethyl ammonium chloride chitosan, HACC), could effectively inhibit bacterial adherence and biofilm formation <italic>in vitro.</italic> Therefore, the aim of this study was to further investigate the <italic>in vitro</italic> cytocompatibility with osteogenic cells and the <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-infection activity of titanium implants with HACC-loaded nanotubes (NT-H). The titanium implant (Ti), nanotubes without polymer loading (NT), and nanotubes loaded with chitosan (NT-C) were fabricated and served as controls. Firstly, we evaluated the cytocompatibility of these specimens with human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. The observation of cell attachment, proliferation, spreading, and viability <italic>in vitro</italic> showed that NT-H has improved osteogenic activity compared with Ti and NT-C. A prophylaxis rat model with implantation in the femoral medullary cavity and inoculation with methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> was established and evaluated by radiographical, microbiological, and histopathological assessments. Our <italic>in vivo</italic> study demonstrated that NT-H coatings exhibited significant anti-infection capability compared with the Ti and NT-C groups. In conclusion, HACC-loaded nanotubes fabricated on a titanium substrate show good compatibility with osteogenic cells and enhanced anti-infection ability <italic>in vivo</italic>, providing a good foundation for clinical application to combat orthopedic implant-associated infections.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Titanium-based intramedullary nails have been widely used in the treatment of both closed and open tibial and femoral fractures; however, infections may occur, especially in the contaminated tibia and femur fractures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> In a large series of tibial shaft fractures treated by intramedullary nailing, there was an incidence of postoperative infection of 1.9% for closed fractures and 7.7% for open fractures out of 1&#x02009;106 cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> To remedy such an implant-associated infection, systemic administration of antibiotics and removal of intramedullary nails are the two conventional approaches, which may compromise patient compliance and lead to systemic toxicity, osteomyelitis, and bone nonunion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> Thus, it is of great significance to endow the implants with anti-infection properties when the fracture fixation is at high risk of infection.</p><p>As an innovative modification of titanium implants, titania nanotube (TNT) arrays generated over a Ti surface by a simple and adjustable electrochemical anodization process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> have been extensively explored as a new antibiotic-loading method to mitigate the side-effects of systemic drug administration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> Meanwhile, the nano-featured surface topography itself possesses improved antibacterial potential and osteoblastic activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8 bib9 bib10 bib11">8&#x02013;11</xref></sup> The most common microorganisms correlated with implant-associated infection are <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic>, which can adhere to implant surfaces and form biofilms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> Our previous <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies revealed that gentamicin-loaded nanotubes on titanium substrates exhibited evident antibacterial activity for the two bacterial strains mentioned above.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> However, the resistance to &#x003b2;-lactamase, aminoglycoside, lincosamide, trimethoprim, macrolide, tetracycline, and sulfonamide antibiotics in <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> is widespread in current orthopedics surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> Therefore, implants with good antibacterial capability, especially under methicillin-resistant <italic>stapthylococci</italic> infection, is critical to the successful fixation and healing of bone fractures in current orthopedic surgery.</p><p>As a new water-soluble chitosan derivative, quaternized chitosan emerged to address the poor water solubility and restricted antibacterial capability of chitosan under an alkaline environment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17 bib18 bib19">17&#x02013;19</xref></sup> As a cationic antimicrobial agent, quaternized chitosan has a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity caused by the electrostatic interaction between the positively charged quaternary ammonium groups of hydroxypropyltrimethyl ammonium chloride chitosan (HACC) and the negatively charged phosphoryl groups of the phospholipid components of bacteria membranes, which affected the cytoplasmic membrane integrity, eventually leading to cell death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> In our previous reports, HACC-loaded polymethylmethacrylate exhibited obviously inhibited biofilm formation by antibiotic-resistant <italic>staphylococci</italic> both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> However, polymethylmethacrylate bone cement is not suited to intramedullary fixation of bone fractures. Thus, we further fabricated HACC-loaded nanotubes with various diameters on titania implants, which exhibited effectively inhibited bacterial adherence and biofilm formation <italic>in vitro.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup></p><p>Although the <italic>in vitro</italic> antibacterial activity of HACC-loaded nanotubes with a diameter of 200&#x02009;nm was reported to be better than those with a diameter of 160&#x02009;nm,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> the cytocompatibility had a negative correlation with the diameter of the nanotubes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> Therefore, we fabricated TNTs with 160&#x02009;nm diameters on titanium plates and rods for the consideration of both the antibacterial capability and cytocompatibility in this study. Quaternized chitosan with a degree of substitution of 26% was loaded into these nanotubes to form an effective local antibiotic delivery system, and the <italic>in vitro</italic> cytocompatibility was assessed. Then, a methicillin-resistant <italic>S aureus</italic> strain was selected to establish an intramedullary infection model in rats and the <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-infection properties of the HACC-loaded TNTs coating were systematically evaluated. Meanwhile, titanium without modification (Ti), TNTs without drug loading (NT), and chitosan-loaded titania nanotubes (NT-C) were also evaluated and compared.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Preparation of drug-loaded TNTs</title><p>TNTs with diameters of 160&#x02009;nm were manufactured on Ti plates (10&#x02009;mm in diameter and 2&#x02009;mm thick) and rods (15&#x02009;mm in length and 2&#x02009;mm in diameter) at a constant voltage of 70&#x02009;V for 1&#x02009;h by electrochemical anodization treatment according to our previous reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> Chitosan (MW=50&#x02009;000, 87% N-deacetylation) was purchased from Zhejiang Yuhuan Ocean Biochemistry Co., Ltd (Yuhuan, Zhejiang, China). Glycidyl trimethylammonium chloride (MW=151.63&#x02009;g&#x000b7;mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Other chemicals used were of analytical grade. HACC with a quaternary ammonium degree of substitution of 26% and molecular weight of 5.0&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> was prepared by combining chitosan and glycidyl trimethylammonium chloride, as reported in our previous work.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> Then, chitosan and HACC solutions of 20&#x02009;mg&#x000b7;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> dissolved in deionized water were loaded into the TNTs by lyophilization method and vacuum drying.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> In brief, 5&#x02009;&#x003bc;L volume of drug solution was pipetted onto the surface of the nanotube, and then gently spread to ensure even coverage. The drug-loaded specimens were dried under vacuum in a freeze-drying system (Labconco 7753072; Labconco Corp, Kansas City, MO) at &#x02212;45&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 2&#x02009;h. The loading step was repeated for approximately 20 cycles until the nanotubes were loaded with 2&#x02009;mg of chitosan and HACC according to our previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> All prepared samples were sterilized with 25&#x02009;kGy of <sup>60</sup>Co irradiation before performing the <italic>in vitro and in vivo</italic> experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Characterization</title><p>Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, HITACHI SU8220, Tokyo, Japan) was used to verify the surface morphologies of the specimens. The surface wettability of the samples was determined by measuring the static water contact angles using the sessile drop method on a drop-shape analysis system (JC-2000D3, Shanghai Zhongcheng Digital Technology Co., Shanghai, China) at ambient temperature and humidity. Meanwhile, images were collected by the camera. Three measurements were performed at different points on each sample.</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of bacteria</title><p>Methicillin-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> (ATCC43300) was purchased in a freeze-dried form from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). This strain was a biofilm-producing bacterial strain as verified by our previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> Cells were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution to 1&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup>&#x02009;CFUs&#x000b7;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> after overnight trypticase soy broth culture. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of chitosan and 26% HACC against ATCC43300 were previously reported to be 64&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x000b7;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and greater than 1 024&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x000b7;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro</italic> cytocompatibility evaluation</title><p>Human mesenchymal stem cells, isolated and expanded as previously described,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> were selected to evaluate the cytocompatibility of these samples <italic>in vitro</italic>. A cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to analyze cell attachment at 4, 8, and 12&#x02009;h. The cells were seeded into wells containing the specimens at a density of 4.0&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> per cm<sup>2</sup>, and empty wells containing &#x003b1;-MEM and specimens served as blank controls. At each time point, a total of 50&#x02009;&#x003bc;L of CCK-8 solution (Dojindo Molecular Technologies Inc., Kumamoto, Japan) was added to each well and then incubated for 3&#x02009;h before reading at 450&#x02009;nm, with 620&#x02009;nm as the reference wavelength. The mean absorbance value (optical density) obtained from the blank control was subtracted from the optical densities of the tested groups. Meanwhile, the cells on the discs were also stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probe, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 15&#x02009;min to observe the cell adhesion using a fluorescence microscope (Leica AF 6000, Heideberg, Germany).</p><p>Similar to the cell adhesion test, cell proliferation was also evaluated by the CCK-8 assay after 1, 4, and 7 days, and the seeding density of the cells was 2.0&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> per cm<sup>2</sup>. The modified optical density values at 4 and 7 were normalized to those at day 1 in terms of the number of attached cells grown on different samples at day 1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> The cell spreading and morphology on the discs were visualized by confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) (Leica TCS SP8, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany), and the cell seeding procedures were similar to those of the cell attachment test. After 24&#x02009;h of incubation, the samples were fixed with 4.0% paraformaldehyde for 15&#x02009;min, and then the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10&#x02009;min. After washing three times with PBS, the filamentous actin of the cell cytoskeleton was stained with rhodamine-phalloidin (Biotium, Hayward, CA) for 45&#x02009;min, and then the nuclei were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 15&#x02009;min.</p><p>In addition, the cell viability of various specimens was analyzed by a Live/Dead Cell kit (ab115347, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> The cell seeding procedures were similar to those of the cell spreading assay. After a 24-h co-culture, cells attached on the specimens were stained with 500&#x02009;&#x003bc;L of combination dye for 10&#x02009;min, and were then detected by the CLSM (Leica TCS SP8). The viable cells with esterase activity appeared green, whereas dead cells with compromised plasma membranes appeared red, as described in the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>Implant infection model in rats</title><p>The <italic>in vivo</italic> experimental procedures were approved and performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Animal Ethics Committee of Shanghai Ninth People&#x02019;s Hospital. Forty-five specified pathogen-free grade 8-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats (weighing 399.07&#x000b1;20.73&#x02009;g) were randomly assigned to three independent groups (<italic>n</italic>=15 for each group). According to the previously reported surgical procedures,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> the left knee was exposed through a middle parapatellar incision after general anesthesia with an intraperitoneal injection of 1% pentobarbital sodium (100&#x02009;mg&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> body weight). The femoral medullary cavity was widened gradually with Kirschner rods to a diameter of 2.0&#x02009;mm after the dislocation of the patellar. Then, 50&#x02009;&#x003bc;L of PBS containing ATCC43300 at a concentration of 1&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> CFUs&#x000b7;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> was injected into the medullary cavity using a micropipette. Subsequently, a prepared Ti, NT-C, or NT-H rod was inserted. The opening cavity was sealed with bone wax, and then the surgical site was closed layer by layer. The rats were kept separate and allowed to eat and drink <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Fluorescence labeling was used to investigate new bone formation around the implants according to the established protocol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> In brief, calcein green (20&#x02009;mg&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> body weight; Sigma-Aldrich) was injected subcutaneously at day 3 before sacrifice.

Femurs were harvested and evaluated using a high-resolution micro-CT (SCANCO MEDICAL, &#x003bc;CT 80, CH-8306, Br&#x000fc;ttisellen, Switzerland) at an isometric resolution of 20&#x02009;&#x003bc;m (70 kV and 130&#x02009;&#x003bc;A radiation source with 0.5&#x02009;mm aluminum filter). Three-dimensional high-resolution reconstruction images obtained from the overall, longitudinal and transverse sections, the bone volume/total volume and the cortical bone mineral density of rat femurs were analyzed by the software (Image Processing Language, v4.29d, Scanco Medical AG, Br&#x000fc;ttisellen, Switzerland) provided by the manufacturer.</p></sec><sec><title>Microbiological assessment</title><p>Six rods in each group were aseptically explanted and rolled over trypticase soy agar for semi-quantification of bacteria adhesion on the rods on the day of sacrifice. The rods were placed in 5&#x02009;mL PBS and then sonicated in an ultrasonic bath at 150&#x02009;W (B3500S-MT, Shanghai, China) at a frequency of 50&#x02009;Hz for 5&#x02009;min, followed by rapid vortex mixing (Vortex Genie 2, Scientific Industries, New York, NY) at maximum power for 1&#x02009;min to thoroughly dislodge the adhered bacteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> The adhered bacteria in the collected solutions after ultrasonication were measured by the spread plate method as previously reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> Then, the femurs after explantation were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground to a powder under sterile conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> The bone powder was homogeneously vortexed in 5&#x02009;mL PBS for 2&#x02009;min.

CLSM and SEM were used for direct observation of biofilm formation on different rods after explantation. The rods were stained with 500&#x02009;&#x003bc;L of combination dye (LIVE/DEAD BacLight Viability Kits, L7012; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and visualized by CLSM. Live bacteria with intact cell membranes appeared fluorescent green, whereas dead bacteria with damaged cell membranes appeared fluorescent red. Three-dimensional images were acquired from random rod positions. Meanwhile, the explanted rods were dehydrated by a series of graded ethanol solutions (30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, and 100%) for 10&#x02009;min each. Subsequently, the rods were examined using SEM after critical-point drying and gold sputter-coating.</p></sec><sec><title>Histopathological analysis</title><p>The remaining three femurs without implants of each group were fixed in 4% buffered formaldehyde for 2 days and decalcified for 1 week using Rapidly Decalcifier (DeCa DX-1000; Pro-Cure Medical Technology Co Ltd, Kwun Tong, Hong Kong) and then embedded in paraffin and cut using a microtome (CUT 6062; SLEE Medical, Mainz, Germany) to obtain 5-&#x003bc;m longitudinal and transverse sections. Hematoxylin and eosin and Masson&#x02019;s trichrome staining were used to assess morphology, and Giemsa staining was used to assess bacterial contamination. Meanwhile, three undecalcified femurs containing rods were embedded in methyl methacrylate for infiltration and polymerization after fixation and graded dehydration. The embedded specimens were transversely cut at the middle and condyle of the femur (Leica SP1600 cutting equipment, Germany). The cut surface was glued to a slide, and sections were ground to a thickness of approximately 50&#x02009;&#x003bc;m. The undecalcified sections were stained with Van Gieson to observe the morphology of the cortical bone and osteointegration around the implants. Slices labeled with fluorochrome were used to observe the new bone formation around the implants.

Furthermore, implant removal and multiple debridements are often necessary, which results in an unacceptable economic and psychological burden for both physician and patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup></p><p>Implant surfaces favor bacterial adhesion, colonization, and biofilm formation after implantation, and the dose of contaminating colonies required to cause infection is low when the surgical site contains foreign material, according to several reported experimental models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> Furthermore, there is an immuno-incompetent fibro-inflammatory zone in the interstitial milieu around the implants, which is susceptible to bacterial colonization and favorable to the recurrence of infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup> After the initial adhesion of bacteria to implant surfaces during a post-implantation period of 4&#x02013;6&#x02009;h, cell aggregation and accumulation occur to form a mature biofilm, which exhibits enhanced antibiotics resistance and increased protection from the host defense.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> Therefore, bacterial adhesion inhibition is of great importance to the manufacture of anti-infection implants.</p><p>The surface characteristics of biomaterials have been supposed to be important to bacteria and cell adhesion during the &#x0201c;race to the surface&#x0201d; competition. Hydrophobicity plays a critical role in a wide range of bacterial infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> Hydrophobic surfaces exhibit a trend of bacterial adhesion due to nonspecific adsorption of proteins and hydrophobic-hydrophobic interactions with bacterial surfaces, and it is supposed that reduced interaction between bacteria and a hydrophobic matrix could be achieved by increasing surface hydrophilicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39 bib40 bib41">39&#x02013;41</xref></sup> Our results revealed that the hydrophilicity of NT and NT-H was significantly improved compared with Ti, which indicates that the nanotube structure formed on the titanium substrate increased the hydrophilicity of the surfaces. Meanwhile, the relatively high hydrophobicity observed on the NT-C surfaces may be caused by the poor water solubility of chitosan. Accordingly, the surface energy and adhesion work of NT and NT-H are also significantly higher than Ti and NT-C, which is believed to be meaningful to bacterial adhesion inhibition, as previously reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> Meanwhile, our <italic>in vitro</italic> cytocompatibility assessments revealed that NT and NT-H displayed good osteogenic activity when compared with Ti and NT-C, which indicates that the vitality of human mesenchymal stem cells is not obviously affected by the loaded HACC and high hydrophilicity may be beneficial to the attachment of osteogenic cells.</p><p>However, there are opposite conclusions in regard to the relationship between the surface chemistry of the biomaterial and its antibacterial properties, which showed a positive correlation between the hydrophilicity and bacterial adherence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> Therefore, it is important to evaluate the <italic>in vivo</italic> antibacterial properties of the nanotube structure and the drug-loaded TNTs. Our <italic>in vivo</italic> results demonstrated that the chitosan-loaded TNTs showed obvious development of bone infection, which indicates that both the nanotube structure and surface characteristics exhibited limited <italic>in vivo</italic> antibacterial activity over the course of 6 weeks post-surgery. The NT-H group showed good implant-bone contact, cortical integrity and dramatically decreased bacterial load; however, evident bone destruction and bacterial burden were observed in the Ti and NT-C groups. Although the <italic>in vitro</italic> antibacterial activity of the chitosan-immobilized titanium surface was investigated and verified by a previous report,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref></sup> our present study indicated that it was still insufficient to prevent the development of bone destruction due to the aggravated implant-associated infection <italic>in vivo</italic> when compared with NT-H. Various modifications were utilized to improve the antibacterial activity of chitosan.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref></sup> Our previous work also found that the nanotube arrays generated on the implants exhibited alleviated bone infection <italic>in vivo</italic>, which was similar to the antimicrobial performance of the NT-C in this study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> Therefore, it was necessary to use the HACC-loaded nanotube structure to prevent the development of bone infection <italic>in vivo.</italic> Although the hydrophilic interfaces of the biomaterials played positive roles in the bacterial adherence and biofilm formation inhibition in this study, the <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-infection potential of the implants depends on the antibacterial agents loaded in the nanotubes. In addition, the bacteria inoculation (1&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup>CFUs) in the medullary cavity of the distal femur in this animal model was much higher than the clinical amount of contaminating bacteria in the surgical site of the implantation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> which may be an important cause of the residual bacteria detected in the NT-H group. According to our previous <italic>in vitro</italic> research, the total amounts of HACC released from nanotubes with a diameter of 160&#x02009;nm over 60&#x02009;h was 1&#x02009;080&#x02009;&#x003bc;g,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> which was above the minimal inhibitory concentration of the tested strain (64&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x000b7;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). Thus, additional systemic antibiotic administration may be necessary to completely eradicate the bacteria, and modification of diameter of nanotubes, which can regulate the drug-loading, is a feasible and effective method to optimize the <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-infection properties of HACC-loaded TNTs. The nanotubular structure of the NT-C and NT-H groups remained intact after the implantation, as displayed at high magnification, which indicated <italic>in vivo</italic> stability of the nanotubes, and therefore provides reliable evidence for the viability of drug-loaded nanotube implants in orthopedic surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, our study demonstrated that HACC-loaded nanotubes on titanium implants exhibited obvious anti-infection potential <italic>in vivo</italic> and good osteoactivity <italic>in vitro</italic> when compared with Ti and NT-C.

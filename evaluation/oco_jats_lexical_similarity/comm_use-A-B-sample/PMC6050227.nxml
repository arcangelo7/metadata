The ligands that bind directly to LRP6 have not been identified. Here, we report that bioactive oxidized phospholipids (oxPLs) are native ligands of LRP6, but not the closely related LRP5. oxPLs are products of lipid oxidation involving in pathological conditions such as hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis, and inflammation. We found that cell surface LRP6 in bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) decreased rapidly in response to increased oxPLs in marrow microenvironment. LRP6 directly bound and mediated the uptake of oxPLs by MSCs. oxPL-LRP6 binding induced LRP6 endocytosis through a clathrin-mediated pathway, decreasing responses of MSCs to osteogenic factors and diminishing osteoblast differentiation ability. Thus, LRP6 functions as a receptor and molecular target of oxPLs for their adverse effect on MSCs, revealing a potential mechanism underlying atherosclerosis-associated bone loss.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="LongSummary"><title>Bone loss: revealing a molecular cause of &#x02018;numb&#x02019; stem cells</title><p id="Par2">A constituent of oxidized &#x02018;bad cholesterol&#x02019; blocks essential signaling processes leading to pathogenic bone loss. LRP6 is a crucial receptor involved in multiple physiological processes, including bone loss; however, direct pathogenic modulators of the receptor have yet to be elucidated. Now, John Hopkins University School of Medicine&#x02019;s Mei Wan, with a US and Chinese research team, has discovered that oxPL, a byproduct of the oxidization of cholesterol carrier LDL, binds directly to LRP6 and causes its removal from the surface of bone marrow stem cells. As a result, these stem cells are unable to sense the external signaling molecules that drive bone growth. oxPLs are products of diseases such as hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis, and this paper helps to reveal their pathogenesis and offers potential targets for therapeutic interventions.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000009</institution-id><institution>Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, Inc.)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK083350</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wan</surname><given-names>Mei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Low-density lipoprotein receptor&#x02013;related protein 6 (LRP6) is a member of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family, which together with LRP5 function as a co-receptor for Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> Upon binding of Wnt to its receptor Frizzled, LRP5/6 is recruited to form a complex with Wnt-Frizzled, eventually leading to downstream &#x003b2;-catenin protein stabilization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> In addition to its role in mediating Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling, LRP6 functions as an essential element in signaling pathways activated by multiple hormones/ growth factors. LRP6 has been found to form a complex with parathyroid hormone (PTH) and its receptor PTH1R in osteoblastic lineage cells, facilitating &#x003b2;-catenin-Tcf/Lef signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) signaling activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> LRP6 also mediates the activation of cAMP-PKA by other G protein&#x02013;coupled receptor ligands including isoproterenol/&#x003b2;-adrenergic receptor, adenosine/adenosine receptors, and glucagon/glucagon receptor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> Moreover, LRP6 was recognized recently as a co-receptor for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)/ PDGF receptor &#x003b2; and transforming growth factor &#x003b2; (TGF&#x003b2;)/TGF-&#x003b2; receptor 1, negatively regulating their signaling activation in pericytes and myofibroblasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> Thus, LRP6 is a unique co-receptor that mediates the intracellular signal transduction of multiple factors. However, all of these factors (i.e. Wnt, PTH, PDGF, and TGF&#x003b2;) have their own receptors. Furthermore, direct interaction of these factors with LRP6 in the absence of their own receptors has not been recognized, indicating that they are not actual ligands of LRP6.</p><p id="Par4">Mutations in LRP6 have been linked to early onset hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerosis, and osteoporosis in humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> Additionally, epidemiological studies have shown a positive correlation of osteoporosis to hyperlipidemia and consequent atherosclerosis, independent of age.

Within oxLDL, the oxidized forms of 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine are the major oxPLs, which contain isolated bioactive components such as POVPC, PGPC, and PEIPC. Whereas native LDL (nLDL) binds to the LDL receptor (LDLR), oxLDL and individual oxPLs bind to several scavenger receptors (SRs), including CD36,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> SR-A,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> and -B,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> the lectin-like oxidized-(LDLR 1 (LOX-1),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> for the uptake of oxLDL by macrophages and vascular cells to facilitate atherosclerosis development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> It has been recognized that the same oxPLs that promote atherosclerosis also act on bone to exert their detrimental effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> However, the major molecular targets of bioactive oxPLs for their adverse effect on bone cells remain elusive.

As the activity of oxLDL is contained primarily in its lipid fraction,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> we tested whether individual biologically active oxPLs exert a similar effect on MSCs as does the oxLDL particle. MSCs treated with the same concentration of POVPC or PGPC, major components of oxPLs within oxLDL, both decreased the percentage of LRP6<sup>+</sup> cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c, d</xref>), supporting the role of POVPC and PGPC as major component oxPLs in oxLDL for its action on MSCs. The percentage of LRP6<sup>+</sup> cells in MSCs was also reduced by Lyso-PC, another component of oxPLs. Consistently, MSCs treated with oxLDL, POVPC, or PGPC had reduced cell surface LRP6 expression relative to the vehicle control group.

We also detected the change of cell surface LRP5, which has a high degree of sequence homology with LRP6, in MSCs after oxPLs treatment. There is an increase in the percentage of LRP5<sup>+</sup> cells in nLDL- and oxLDL-treated cells relative to control cells, with the effect of oxLDL being much more profound (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g, h</xref>).

Knockdown of LRP6 in MSCs significantly inhibited the binding of cell surface&#x02013;bound DiI-oxLDL (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Similarly, a specific binding curve of Pyrene fluorescence-labeled POVPC (PyrOVPC) to MSCs was also achieved (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). The binding affinity of PyrOVPC to MSCs was also markedly lower after LRP6 knockdown by siRNA in MSCs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). Therefore, LRP6 is a key molecule mediating the binding of oxPLs to MSCs. The binding of POVPC to LRP6 in MSCs was also assessed by precipitation assay. MSCs were treated with biotin-labeled POVPC, a biotin precipitation of the cell lysates was performed followed by western blot with LRP6 antibody.

MSCs were incubated with POVPC for different time periods, and the localization of LRP6 was analyzed visually by confocal microscopy. LRP6 resided mainly at the cell surface of MSCs immediately after oxLDL treatment (0&#x02009;min), with a small portion of LRP6 in cellular plasma. At 1, 3, 5, 10, and 30&#x02009;min after oxLDL treatment, LRP6 protein was gradually internalized as punctuated organelles in the cytoplasm (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). We also examined the co-endocytosis of LRP6 and oxLDL in living cells, in which LRP6-eGFP was overexpressed, by time-lapse imaging. Treatment of DiI-oxLDL into the microscope chamber resulted in rapid binding of DiI-oxLDL to the cell membrane and was highly co-localized with LRP6-eGFP (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>, 0&#x02009;min). A rapid movement of the DiI-oxLDL/ LRP6-eGFP cluster from cell membrane to the intracellular compartments was seen in most of the cellular regions 30&#x02009;s to 5&#x02009;min time period (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>, 30&#x02032; to 5&#x02009;min, white arrows indicate the DiI-oxLDL/ LRP6-eGFP cluster). In some regions of the cells only DiI-oxLDL was seen without associated LRP6-eGFP, indicating that LRP6 is not the only receptor mediating oxLDL uptake. It is known that LRP6 is a lipid raft receptor protein that is internalized after Wnt stimulation in a caveolin-mediated process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> Conversely, the endocytosis of LDLR after binding to LDL is mediated by clathrin-coated vesicles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> LRP6 is a member of the LDLR family, with structural domains similar to LDLR. To examine whether oxPL-induced LRP6 endocytosis occurs through caveolin- or clathrin-mediated pathways, we first fractionated the lipid raft and nonlipid raft fractions of the cells treated with nLDL or oxLDL by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The detergent-resistant membranes, including caveolin-1, were obtained in lower-density fractions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>, fractions 4&#x02013;6 in the upper two panels), whereas the soluble membranes, including clathrin, were in higher-density fractions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>, fractions 6&#x02013;10 in the middle two panels). LRP6 was detected mainly in the caveolin-associated lipid raft fraction in nLDL-treated cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>, fraction 3&#x02013;7 in the fifth panel). After oxLDL treatment, a reduced proportion of LRP6 was present with caveolin but an increased proportion of LRP6 was present with clathrin (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>, fraction 5&#x02212;9 in the sixth panel). Therefore, oxLDL may induce LRP6 endocytosis through a clathrin-associated pathway. We then assessed the effects of pharmacological inhibitors of clathrin-mediated and caveolin-mediated endocytosis on LRP6 expression on the MSC surface after the cells were stimulated with nLDL or oxLDL. MSCs incubated with oxLDL but not nLDL had significantly reduced LRP6 expression on cell surface (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). Importantly, oxLDL-induced cell surface LRP6 reduction was antagonized by clathrin-dependent endocytosis inhibitor monodansylcadaverine (MDC) but not by Filipin III, an inhibitor of caveolin-mediated endocytosis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>), indicating that oxPL-induced endocytosis of LRP6 is dependent on clathrin- but not caveolin-mediated pathway.

Our results from this study suggest that LRP6 serves as a specific receptor for oxPLs and is a major molecular target of oxPLs for their negative actions on bone marrow MSCs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7k</xref>). Evidence to support this concept came from flow cytometry analysis, fluorescence spectra-based ligand-receptor binding assays, biotin-precipitation assays, PLO assays, and subcellular localization assays showing a specific binding of LRP6 with oxPLs, followed by LRP6 endocytosis. We showed that LRP6 on the cell surface of bone marrow MSCs was reduced under the increased oxPLs in bone marrow microenvironment in mice. Direct treatment of the MSCs with oxPLs also induced rapid reduction in cell surface LRP6. Therefore, the in vivo and in vitro results implicate that LRP6 on MSC surface senses and responds to the change in oxPLs in the extracellular environment. Several SRs of oxLDL, such as CD36, LOX-1, SR-AI, SR-BI, and TLR-4, have been identified.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> These receptors directly bind oxPLs and mediate the uptake of oxLDL and oxPLs. Specifically, CD36 and SR-A are principal SRs accounting for up to 90% of oxLDL loading in macrophages,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> which are key players in all stages of atherosclerosis. The fact that cell surface CD36 was unchanged in bone marrow MSCs but reduced in macrophages in response to a high level oxPLs suggests that CD36 serves as a receptor of oxPLs in macrophages, and LRP6 may function as a specific oxPL receptor in MSCs. LRP6 may not be the only oxPLs receptor in MSCs as we found that the binding of POVPC to MSC cell surface was not fully blocked by LRP6 knockdown in the binding assays. The expression of LOX-1 was elevated in bone marrow MSCs from HFD mice relative to CHD mice, suggesting an involvement of LOX-1 in oxPL-induced functional change in bone marrow MSCs. It remains to be determined whether LOX-1 serves as another receptor for oxPLs in MSCs and its distinct role in regulating MSC functions. Previous studies showed that LRP6 functions as a receptor for nLDL clearance in splenic B-lymphocytes and fibroblasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup> nLDL and oxLDL act on different receptors for their uptake by cells, and it is likely that the same nLDL or oxLDL uses distinct receptors in different types of cells in a tissue-specific manner.</p><p id="Par15">An interesting phenomenon from the present study is the apparently different response of LRP5 and LRP6 in MSCs to oxPL stimulation. In contrast to the reduced cell surface LRP6 in MSCs with oxLDL- and individual oxPL-treatment, LRP5 cell surface level was significantly increased in both nLDL- and oxLDL-treated cells. oxLDL-induced, but not nLDL-induced, LRP5 elevation was completely abolished by LRP6 knockdown in MSCs, indicating a LRP6-dependent effect. These results suggest that oxPLs-induced increase in cell surface LRP5, which shares 71% amino-acid homology to LRP6,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup> is a compensatory effect of oxPL-induced LRP6 reduction in MSC surface. The possible reason for the blunted Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling in response to oxPL stimulation is that the increased LRP5 level is still unable to fully compensate the impaired WNT/&#x003b2;-Catenin signaling caused by LRP6 deficiency. Increasing evidence suggest that although both LRP5 and 6 serve as Wnt co-recepters for the canonical &#x003b2;-catenin signaling, LRP6 is more effective than LRP5 in transducing the Wnt signaling. Genetically, the developmental phenotypes of <italic>Lrp6</italic> mutant mice is much more severe than LRP5 mutant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup> Functionally, expression of LRP6 alone, but not LRP5 alone, is able to induce a secondary axis in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> Similarly in mammalian cell culture, LRP5 only weakly activates the Wnt pathway in the absence of an exogenous Wnt, in contrast to the highly active LRP6.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup> Structurally, LRP6 cytoplasmic domain harbors stronger signaling activity than that of LRP5.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup> Therefore, it is possible that LRP5 level was elevated in response to LRP6 deficiency as a compensatory mechanism; however, it failed to completely restore WNT/&#x003b2;-Catenin signaling. We also noticed that in the LRP5 knockdown MSCs, nLDL uptake, but not oxLDL uptake was significantly reduced relative to control cells. Therefore, although LRP5 and LRP6 are highly homologous and they both possess the capacity to bind lipoproteins,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup> they exert distinct actions on MSCs in regulating lipid homeostasis/metabolism. LRP6 is a key molecule in transducing the effects of oxidized lipoprotein and oxidized lipids, whereas LRP5 appears to regulate native oxidized lipoprotein or lipid uptake by MSCs or other bone cells. Consistent with this finding, an earlier study revealed that LRP5, but not LRP6, regulates fatty acid utilization by osteoblasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup></p><p id="Par16">We show that MSCs are a major cellular target of oxPLs in bone marrow in vivo.

We also found that bone marrow MSCs treated with oxPLs had diminished osteoblast differentiation capacity, further suggesting that diminished osteogenesis by MSCs is a key player in hyperlipidemia/atherosclerosis-induced bone loss.

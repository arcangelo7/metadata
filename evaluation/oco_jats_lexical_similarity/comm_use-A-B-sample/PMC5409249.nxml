published three articles concerning the intersection of cardiovascular surgery and
entrepreneurship. One of the articles brings the international case of the Indian
cardiovascular surgeon Dr. Devi Shetty, who created a health management model that
revolutionized Indian reality. A second article dissects a Brazilian case, the
startup of the cardiovascular surgeon Dr. Marcus Vinicius Gimenes, named "Consulta
do Bem", which seeks to facilitate access to private health care by making use of
shared economic model. Finally, the last article discuss the importance of
leadership for cardiovascular surgeons and how the concept of leadership changed
since the last decades.</p><p>I myself, as a cardiovascular surgeon, was compelled to be an entrepreneur, to
produce cardiac pericardial valves, not available in the country at the beginning of
our specialty. So, I deeply believe that entrepreneurship must be instigated in our
young students, residents, and surgeons. Entrepreneurship is the key to progress
and, if we want cardiovascular surgery keeps advancing and being known for its
innovative nature, we must ensure that the new generations are stimulated and free
to create new things.</p><p>Another believe I have is that innovation must come from the Universities, in close
cooperation with the medical devices Industry. The University is the ideal place
which brings together the young, smart and dedicated people, the knowledge
accessibility and the resources to develop and test new concepts, to be produced and
distributed by the Industries. It was not a coincidence that, within university
surgeons, as Prof. Euryclides of Jesus Zerbini and Prof. Adib Jatene, was developed
a mindset that we should, create and manufacture many of the equipment for
cardiovascular surgery in Brazil. An interesting tool recently created, and which
relates to what I mentioned before, is the Brazilian Index of Entrepreneurial
Universities. It is a ranking based on how the Universities in Brazil stimulate
innovation and entrepreneurship and can be accessed at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bit.ly/indexofentrepreneurialuniversities">http://bit.ly/indexofentrepreneurialuniversities</ext-link>. After you check
the Index, I invite you to inquire yourself with the following questions: How does
my University scores in the ranking? What can I do to improve this score?</p><p>With these thoughts, I urge all my surgeons colleagues to learn more about
entrepreneurship, develop your ideas and stimulate your fellows to do the same. Only
then, we will bring back the innovative spirit which for long characterized the
field of cardiovascular surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>44<sup>th</sup> Brazilian Congress of Cardiovascular Surgery</title><p>From April 20 to 22, the 44<sup>th</sup> Brazilian Congress of Cardiovascular Surgery
will take place at Riocentro Exhibition &#x00026; Convention Center in Rio de Janeiro,
RJ.</p><p>The theme this year is "High Technology: Acquiring Knowledge to employ it
better".</p><p>At the same time, the 7<sup>th</sup> Symposium of Nursing in Cardiovascular Surgery,

subjects are the understanding of mitral regurgitation pathophysiology after repair
or replacement, the standard of surgical management in coronary artery bypass
grafting (CABG) and the role of surgery in treatment of cardiac failure of ischemic
etiology are 3 issues of interest to surgeons today.</p><p>The presence of 7 several international speakers are: Hartzell Schaff, Mayo Clinic

TAVI, TEVAR, HPTEC - chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and
intraoperative echocardiogram course that will happen on April, 22<sup>rd</sup> are
the news of the 44<sup>th</sup> SBCCV Congress, bringing great professionals to
share their wisdom.</p><p>I congratulate the Board of the SBCCV, the Organizing Committee; coordinated by Dr.
Henrique Murad, on the effort made for this meeting to become interesting for all
participants of the Congress.</p><p>This year the free themes will have an award differently. The SBCCV has implemented
several educational projects, including the free themes of the congress, with the

registration for the next SBCCV Congress and 3<sup>rd</sup> place it is a
registration for the next SBCCV Congress. These projects aim to contribute as
encouragement scientific production for each specialty.</p><p>I proudly announce that in this issue we are publishing the first article "The
Brazilian Registry of Adult Patient Undergoing Cardiovascular Surgery, the BYPASS
Project: Results of the First 1,722 Patients" (page 71), which is the beginning to
come true an old dream of the SBCCV that it will allow the access of safety database
about cardiovascular surgery in the country. The BYPASS, will also be introduced by
Dr. Walter Gomes at clinical studies table, that impacts surgical procedures on
Friday.</p><p>BJCVS will have a stand working together with SBCCV, that it will host every
participant during the meeting.</p><p>During the Welcome Cocktail event, there will be the prelaunch of the book

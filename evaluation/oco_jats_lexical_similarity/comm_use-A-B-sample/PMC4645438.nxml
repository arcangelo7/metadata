The report calls for a shift towards optimizing functional ability by building individual capacities and compensating for any lack of physical or mental function, for example, with mobility aids and other technology.</p><p>&#x0201c;The greatest costs to society are not the expenditures made to foster this functional ability, but the benefits that might be missed if we fail to make the appropriate adaptations and investments,&#x0201d; said Dr Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General, in the preface.</p><p>A change both in approach and attitude is required. The 246-page report launched on 30 September argues that common perceptions of the ageing process and what is needed to address older people&#x02019;s needs are &#x0201c;stereotyped&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;outdated&#x0201d; and not backed by the latest scientific evidence.</p><p>Drawing on the evidence in the report, WHO proposes a global strategy and action plan on ageing and health for countries to better address the needs of older people. </p><p>An online public consultation on the draft strategy is open until 30 October, (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/ageing/consultation/">http://www.who.int/ageing/consultation/</ext-link>). The draft strategy will be discussed at a global consultation with Member States and other stakeholders on 29&#x02013;30 October in Geneva, Switzerland.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/ageing">http://www.who.int/ageing</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>R&#x00026;D for affordable treatment</title><p>Research and development (R&#x00026;D) projects for hepatitis C, which affects 130 to 150 million people worldwide, and mycetoma, a chronic inflammation, will soon be launched, according to the new business plan of the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi).</p><p>The partnership also said it would create an internal task force with WHO to look into establishing an R&#x00026;D initiative to develop new antibiotics, given growing antibiotic resistance worldwide and the dearth of new candidate antibiotics in the drugs pipeline.</p><p>New effective drugs for hepatitis C are prohibitively expensive especially for people in low- and middle-income countries and an estimated 500 000 people die worldwide every year from hepatitis C-related liver diseases.</p><p>To develop affordable treatment for hepatitis C infection, DNDi said it would conduct clinical trials for drug combinations consisting of recently approved drugs in middle-income countries.</p><p>&#x0201c;The high cost of a new generation of drugs for hepatitis C has become one of the world&#x02019;s most pressing and high-profile public health challenges, leaving millions of patients behind,&#x0201d; DNDi said.</p><p>For mycetoma, DNDi said it would test a promising drug candidate for this &#x0201c;devastating illness for which there has been virtually no R&#x00026;D &#x02013; leaving patients suffering from the effects of toxic and ineffective drugs&#x0201d;.</p><p>The independent not-for-profit partnership, which aims to develop affordable drugs, said it was launching new projects having transferred its malaria activities to another R&#x00026;D partnership, Medicines for Malaria Venture.</p><p>With a pipeline of over 30 projects for some of the world&#x02019;s most neglected diseases, DNDi aims to deliver 16 to 18 new treatments with an estimated total budget of &#x020ac;650 million (US$ 728 million) by its 20th anniversary in 2023.</p><p>The DNDi pipeline includes R&#x00026;D projects for treatments for African trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, and Chagas disease as well as filarial diseases and paediatric HIV, according to its 2015&#x02013;2023 business plan that was released last month.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dndi.org/">http://www.dndi.org/</ext-link></p><boxed-text id="Bb" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Cover photo</title></caption><p>The vast influx of refugees and migrants to countries of the WHO European Region calls for an urgent response to their health needs.

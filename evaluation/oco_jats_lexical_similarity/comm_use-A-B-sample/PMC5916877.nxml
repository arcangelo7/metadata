Our goal was to evaluate a novel human monoclonal antibody (mAb) probe directed against the Gram-positive bacterial surface molecule lipoteichoic acid (LTA). Specificity and affinity were assessed in vitro. We then radiolabeled the anti-LTA mAb and evaluated its effectiveness as a diagnostic imaging tool for detecting infection via immunoPET imaging in an in vivo mouse model of prosthetic joint infection (PJI). In vitro and ex vivo binding of the anti-LTA mAb to pathogenic bacteria was measured with Octet, ELISA, and flow cytometry. The in vivo PJI mouse model was assessed using traditional imaging modalities, including positron emission tomography (PET) with [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG and [<sup>18</sup>F]NaF as well as X-ray computed tomography (CT), before being evaluated with the zirconium-89-labeled antibody specific for LTA ([<sup>89</sup>Zr]SAC55). The anti-LTA mAb exhibited specific binding in vitro to LTA-expressing bacteria. Results from imaging showed that our model could reliably simulate infection at the surgical site by bioluminescent imaging, conventional PET tracer imaging, and bone morphological changes by CT. One day following injection of both the radiolabeled anti-LTA and isotype control antibodies, the anti-LTA antibody demonstrated significantly greater (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) uptake at <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>-infected prosthesis sites over either the same antibody at sterile prosthesis sites or of control non-specific antibody at infected prosthesis sites. Taken together, the radiolabeled anti-LTA mAb, [<sup>89</sup>Zr]SAC55, may serve as a valuable diagnostic molecular imaging probe to help distinguish between sterile inflammation and infection in the setting of PJI. Future studies are needed to determine whether these findings will translate to human PJI.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="LongSummary"><title>Joint replacements: Distinguishing infection from inflammation</title><p id="Par5">A new imaging technique distinguishes bacterial infection at the site of joint implants from less-serious postoperative inflammation, saving patients from unnecessary and invasive treatments. Daniel Thorek of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and colleagues used an antibody that binds to lipoteichoic acid on the cell wall of <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> bacteria to detect infection at joint implant sites. The antibody was labeled with a radioactive agent and injected into mice that simulated infection of a knee replacement site. A PET scan conducted 1 day after antibody injection showed that it gathered at the infected joint significantly more than it did at the uninfected implant sites in other mice. This method could improve the diagnosis of joint implant infection, which necessitates removal of the prosthetic and all infected tissues, followed by prolonged antibiotic therapy.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par6">Total joint arthroplasty is a common orthopedic surgical procedure with not only significant benefits but also challenging complications, especially related to infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> Prosthetic joint infection (PJI), which is an infection involving the implant and adjacent bone and joint tissues, affects up to 2% of all primary arthroplasties, resulting in an estimated 25&#x02009;000 cases and costs exceeding $3.2 billion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> The current standard of care therapy for chronic PJI of the hip and knee involves complete removal of all infected tissue and implants with eventual hardware replacement after prolonged antibiotic therapy.

X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reveal gross morphological changes but unfortunately produce implant-related artifacts (especially involving metallic implants) that obscure relevant changes in the surrounding tissue.</p><p id="Par8">Positron emission tomography (PET) generates three-dimensional (3D) tracer concentration images with the potential for excellent sensitivity and without implant artifacts suffered by computed tomography (CT) and MRI. The sensitivity of this modality has the ability to detect infectious burden and molecular changes that occur prior to macroscopic anatomical alterations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> Widely used conventional tracers, including [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG (2-fluoro-2-deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-glucose), [<sup>18</sup>F]NaF, and [<sup>68</sup>Ga]citrate, have been investigated for PET localization and evaluation of PJI with variable success.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> However, current imaging approaches assess indirect markers of infection&#x02014;methods that are often hindered by low specificity and/or sensitivity&#x02014;rather than directly targeting the infectious agent.</p><p id="Par9">An alternative approach to improve diagnosis of PJI may be to use targeted probes, such as antibodies or peptides.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> Radiolabeled antibodies for immunoPET have long been used for investigational and clinical studies for oncological applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> Prior infection-related investigations have focused on antibodies to human targets such as white blood cells or other indirect markers of infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> In this study, we assessed an antibody directly targeting Gram-positive bacteria such as <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> (the bacteria commonly responsible for PJI).

Commonly used X-ray, CT, and MRI may not reliably distinguish sterile joint loosening from infection. Development of a bacteria-specific imaging probe would allow for differentiation of infectious processes from sterile inflammation. The sensitivity of PET imaging would be particularly valuable in settings of low bacterial burden. Here we evaluated a human mAb directed against LTA, a component of the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria (implicated in &#x0003e;60% of PJI).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> The high-affinity mAb, SAC55, exhibited specific binding to Gram-positive <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>epidermidis</italic> not only after in vitro growth (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b, c</xref>) but also after in vivo passage in mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). With the intent to specifically and noninvasively image the bacterial pathogen directly and to facilitate improved sensitivity of detection, we have developed [<sup>89</sup>Zr]SAC55. This immunoPET agent provided statistically significant distinction of both the presence of infection over sterile implant sites as well as targeted over non-specific antibody.</p><p id="Par20">Typically, immunoPET imaging has been conducted several days after administration as background blood pool clearance of the antibody is required to distinguish the site of interest. Consequently, we utilized the relatively long-lived isotope zirconium-89. However, we observed that the signal ratio of [<sup>89</sup>Zr]anti-LTA mAb at the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>-infected postoperative legs vs contralateral, non-operative legs was greatest at 1 day after administration. We speculate that this may be in part due to the improved immune system recognition of the bacteria after antibody binding, leading to the clearance of both the bacteria and the tracer from the site. Shortening the time between injection and imaging would improve the logistics of utilizing this technology in patients and may allow for the use of shorter-lived isotopes, resulting in reduced radiation exposure.</p><p id="Par21">SAC55 was compared to conventional PET tracers and CT imaging. [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG has previously been explored as a non-specific probe for evaluating PJI with varying success.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> PET provides insight into the metabolism of host tissue, as cells that utilize radioglucose trap the tracer locally. PET provides millimeter-scale tomographic images of tracer distribution throughout the whole body, while CT provides higher-resolution attenuation maps of use for anatomical localization, abnormal tissue findings, and to identify sites of bone degeneration. We have shown that FDG uptake in the surgical distal femur of infected mice was much greater than that of the contralateral, nonsurgical femur and also correlated with the BLI findings in the surgical vs nonsurgical sites. However, we also found increased FDG uptake in the sterile surgical leg (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>), suggesting that some uptake is due to inflammation caused by the surgery. While [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG may easily identify robust PJI, indolent infections with low bacterial burdens, or those being actively treated, may be indistinguishable from sterile background inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup></p><p id="Par22">[<sup>18</sup>F]NaF has previously been used to assess the impacts of tuberculosis and total hip arthroplasty, as it is taken up by the surrounding bone matrix at these degenerative sites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> While gross morphological changes were seen in this study after months of infection in the mouse model, such changes may not be distinguishable in the absence of long-term infection. Remodeling of the bone due to sterile inflammation may again preclude the distinction of indolent infection vs sterile inflammation, as confirmed when comparing the sterile implant to the contralateral knee (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). While CT and [<sup>18</sup>F]NaF PET may not aid in early diagnosis of PJI, they may be useful once substantial remodeling has occurred. A correlation analysis across the PET imaging probes and that of bacterial-specific bioluminescence indicates the specificity of the antibody-targeted PET imaging approach.</p><p id="Par23">This study was limited in part by the fact that the physes in mice are continually active and do not fuse, as occurs in humans. This results in sustained bone turnover and signal at the ends of the long bones by both [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG and [<sup>18</sup>F]NaF.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> However, this confound was controlled for by comparing postoperative joints to their contralateral, non-operative sites, which also have an active physis. There are also practical considerations that are relevant when comparing different imaging tracers or modalities of translational import. While it is finding greater acceptance in the cancer-imaging realm, [<sup>89</sup>Zr]-labeled antibody PET imaging is still performed at only a small number of sites worldwide. CT imaging, [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG, and [<sup>18</sup>F]NaF PET are routinely performed and can provide same day (outpatient) logistics. Often with mAbs, the long clearance time after injection requires several days between administration and imaging. Intriguingly, here we have observed that the optimal [<sup>89</sup>Zr]SAC55 imaging time point was only 24&#x02009;h after injection. BLI of bacteria in small animals is generally feasible but requires genetic manipulation of the infectious organism that may alter properties of the model and is not suitable for larger animal models or human use (as the light-producing proteins are highly immunogenic and provide signal sufficient for superficial imaging).</p><p id="Par24">In conclusion, we have demonstrated the ability of an anti-LTA mAb immunoPET imaging probe to discriminate infection from non-specific inflammation in a preclinical mouse model of PJI. We have further highlighted the potential and shortcomings of conventional PET tracers in imaging of these models. We plan to examine the role of molecularly specific imaging to monitor efficacy of the SAC55 mAb as a targeted therapeutic to clear LTA-positive infections. Investigation in larger animal models and in patients is needed to determine whether the [<sup>89</sup>Zr]SAC55 probe can be translated to diagnose PJI and other infections in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Antibody development</title><p id="Par25">The monoclononal antibody (mAb) specific for LTA (anti-LTA, SAC55) was identified from IgG<sup>+</sup> memory B cells selected from a patient convalescing from a <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> skin infection (erysipelas), as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> A human IgG1 mAb (R347, directed against an unrelated HIV-gp120 antigen) was used as an isotype control human IgG1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Antibody labeling</title><p id="Par26">The heterobifunctional chelate,&#x000a0;p-SCN-Bn-DFO, was from Macrocyclics (Dallas, TX).

List-mode data were acquired using a gamma-ray energy window of 350&#x02013;750&#x02009;keV and a coincidence timing window of 6&#x02009;ns. PET image data were corrected for detector nonuniformity, dead time, random coincidences, and physical decay. For all static images, scan time was between 10 and 20&#x02009;min.

Data sets were analyzed using the ASIPro VM microPET analysis software. Volumes of interest were manually defined around the distal femur, and the injected activity per gram was calculated. An empirically determined system calibration factor for mice was used to convert voxel count rates to activity concentrations (in &#x000b5;Ci per mL of tissue). Figures were generated using Amira (version 5.0; FEI, Hillsboro, OR).

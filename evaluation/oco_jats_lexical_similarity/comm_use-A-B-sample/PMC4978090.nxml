To analyze the characteristics of pediatric burns in the south of Liaoning province of China, a retrospective review was conducted of information, including general characteristics, demographics, etiology of burns, anatomical areas burned, and severity of injuries, obtained from medical records of pediatric burn patients admitted to the Burn Center of Anshan Hospital of the First Hospital of China Medical University from 2002 to 2011. Differences between age-groups and cause and severity of injuries were examined using Cochran-Mantel-Haenzsel (C-M-H) statistic or chi-square (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>) analyses where appropriate. A total of 985 pediatric burn cases were included, with only one death. The maximal burn area recorded was 80% and the maximal third-degree burn area was 45%. The majority of burns (637/985, 64.67%) were moderate second-degree wounds, encompassing 5&#x02013;14% of the total body surface area. The infant age-group (&#x0003c;3 years old) had the largest representation (622/985, 63.15%), with more males than females affected. Most of the injuries occurred at home in children living in the local region. Scalding accounted for 89.85% (885/985) of all injuries, with a decreasing incidence with age, whereas injuries due to flames and from electrical sources markedly increased with age. Only a minority of guardians (244/985, 24.77%) had burn prevention knowledge, and none of them knew how to provide first-aid treatment for burn injuries. These results indicate that the majority of pediatric burns occur in children less than 3 years of age from scalds received while at home. As a large proportion of these cases occurred in rural areas, programs emphasizing burn prevention and treatment knowledge should therefore be made more available to these families.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Burns</kwd><kwd>pediatric</kwd><kwd>scald</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>In China, accidental injury is the first cause of death in children less than 14 years old, with more than 50,000 deaths per year.

Furthermore, the long-term treatment and rehabilitation process can lead to physical, psychological, and economic problems for both the victims and their families. The Burn Center of Anshan Hospital of the First Hospital of China Medical University was established in 1958 with 80 beds for the treatment of patients with acute burns. This Burn Center serves a population of 10 million registered residents of Anshan, and also receives patients from the south of Liaoning province as well as neighboring provinces. The objective of this study was to analyze the epidemiologic characteristics of pediatric burns within this population in order to identify the most vulnerable population that would receive the greatest benefit from burn prevention programs.<table-wrap id="TabA"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="2">Access this article online</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2">

A large proportion of infants in pediatric burn populations was also reported in an earlier study,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] indicating that children in this age group are not mature enough to protect themselves, and require greater attention from parents or other guardians.</p><p>A greater proportion of the pediatric cases in this study were males, with a male to female ratio of 1.68:1 that is higher than that of other reports.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] The increased male population observed in the present study may be due to the traditional Chinese preference for sons, especially in rural areas, who serve as the main workforce. According to the China National Bureau of Statistics data reported in 2011, the male to female ratio in the countryside is higher than the overall national ratio. Moreover, the majority of pediatric cases present in our population were local rural residents, despite the fact that only 37.85% of the population of Liaoning province is rural. The higher incidence may be related to the fact that supervision, security and facilities in rural families are generally poorer than those found in urban families.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] Therefore, prevention programs focused on pediatric burns should be targeted to rural populations.</p><p>Results of this study also demonstrate that almost 90% of the pediatric burns were a result of scalding that occurred at home, much higher than an earlier report from the Middle East.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] Unlike Western countries where hot water temperature is regulated to avoid scalding,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] in China, hot water stored for cooking, washing and bathing is a primary source for burns to children.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] As a result, young children who are at home for most of the day are most vulnerable. Burns to children in this study often occurred when they were unsupervised in an area where they could reach the hot water. Thus it is important for the guardians to be aware of the potential hazards in the home, especially at meal and bath times. Furthermore, some habits should be changed in order to prevent burns. For example, bath water for infants is typically prepared by first pouring boiling water into the basin and then adding cold water. To prevent burns from children accidentally falling into the basin, the order should be reversed.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]</p><p>Although the majority of pediatric burns can be avoided by preventing scalding, flame and electrical burns should not be ignored because of the poorer associated prognosis, such as amputation, scar hyperplasia and physical dysfunction. As the age of the patients increased, the proportion of burns due to scalding decreased while flame and electrical injuries markedly increased, which is consistent with findings from a study in India.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] However, widespread burn prevention knowledge in older children in China is lacking,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and thus the most likely causes of burns and prevention strategies for each age group should be emphasized. In addition, the risk of burns from flames, firecrackers and electricity should be stressed in school-aged males in rural areas where the incidence of burns from these sources was highest.</p><p>Consistent with findings from a pediatric burn study in the US, the majority of cases brought to the burn clinic were of moderate severity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] It is possible, however, that burns of a milder severity did not require hospitalization and were not included in these studies, resulting in an underestimation of the number of mildly burned children. The small proportion of critical burns should not be overlooked, as treatment for these patients involves the greatest medical cost, and long-term physical and psychological dysfunction.</p><p>As the majority of pediatric burns are preventable,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] a greater concerted effort from family members, schools, and the community should be implemented. As infants have no awareness of potential dangers, they are particularly vulnerable to burns from hot fluids placed where they could reach without proper supervision, especially at meal or bath times.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] The observation in the present study that only one quarter of guardians had some knowledge about burn prevention is consistent with the fact that the majority of burns were scalding injuries to infants. Government agencies, teachers, medical personnel and the media all have the opportunity and responsibility to publicize burn prevention. The media, including newspapers, radio and television, is a particularly effective means and should be exploited for the dissemination of burn prevention knowledge concerning scalding from hot liquids and risks associated with flammable substances and electricity in high-risk environments (home) and populations (infants).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec12"><title>Burn camp taking roots in China</title><p>Twenty-eight smiling, excited kids played with cheers and laughter in the swimming pool at Chunmiao Burn Camp Tuesday, they splashed water and played water polo and had really good time.</p><p>Nothing would distinguish these kids from any others who join other camps&#x02014;except that each of these children is on the recovery trail from different causes of burns or trauma.</p><p>Chunmiao Burn Camp started two years ago and this is the third year.

But, there is no such camp in China before 2012. In contrast, China has the second large population of children under age of 15; burn injury is ranked the fourth place of the accidental injuries in children. Although there is still lack of official data numbered exactly how many children burned each year around China, the fact maybe astonishing. Taking burn unit of Institute of Burn Research for example, burn children can constitute over 50% of outpatients and 30% of inpatients, while the inpatients number of the unit reaches over 1000 during the past years.</p><p>As one of the largest and most influential burn centers in China, the Institute of Burn Research now focus more on the quality of life of burn patients and dedicates to the integration of physical and occupational therapies with clinical treatments, &#x0201c;our goal is to give burn patients dignified lives rather than just wound healing.&#x0201d; Prof. Wu said.</p><p>With the help of volunteer organizations and companies like Chunmiao Charities Aid Foundation for Burned Children, MSI (Medical Service International), Summer Camp Odeman, Anhui Anke biotechnology (Group) CO. LTD, the Chunmiao Burn Camp has run successfully for the third year. It not only provides a place for these kids to find and make friends, but also a chance for medical staffers to see the other side of their journey.</p><p>More information on Chunmiao Burn Camp can be found through the Web site at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.burncamp-china.com">www.burncamp-china.com</ext-link>.</p></sec></app></app-group><fn-group><fn><p>

Outcomes&#x0201d;, published in the Brazilian Journal of Cardiovascular Surgery, volume 31,
issue 4, pages 300-3.</p><p>While the authors should be congratulated for their efforts to develop a pediatric
cardiac surgery program in a difficult context, we have some comments, concerns, and
questions around this article.</p><p>According to the references of this article, there are a few publications reporting the
primary surgical treatment of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) during adulthood. In fact, only
two publications about TOF in adults are enumerated in the references and some important
reports are missing, including one from Brazil<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>This manuscript describes a single center experience in primary repair of adults with TOF
in Pakistan during a two-year time-frame. They reported an impressive number of
patients, but surprisingly they included patients between 12 and 43 years in this
study.</p><p>The point at which a person progresses from childhood into adulthood may vary according
to different cultures and the legal definition usually fluctuates between 16 and 21
years. Including younger patients increases the quantity, but using precise information
is required in order to accurately evaluate surgical results and individualize risk
factors.</p><p>As Lord Kelvin - an Irish mathematical physicist and engineer 1824-1907 - aptly put it,
&#x0201c;What is not defined cannot be measured. What is not measured cannot be improved. What
is not improved always deteriorates.&#x0201d; Then, it is imperative to define the beginning of
adulthood to avoid confounding and to facilitate the application of methods for
meaningful comparison of hospital mortality and morbidity for patients undergoing
surgery for congenital heart disease.</p><p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an adult is a person older than 19
years of age unless national law delimits an earlier age, and an adolescent someone aged
10 to 19 years<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. Additional
literature retrieval about this issue, including those listed by the authors, shows that
TOF in adults is commonly defined as subjects older than 18 years of age. Therefore,
efforts should be made to embrace international parameters in our clinical practice.</p><p>In sum, it is not only a semantic issue, because there are potential errors in analyzing
these data that include subjects younger than 18 years old named as &#x0201c;adults&#x0201d;. For
instance, transannular patches are required more often in children than in adults, due
to the more favorable anatomy encountered in adulthood<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. In table 1, Khan et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> also showed a significant influence of age on the
frequency in both right ventricular outflow tract and transannular patches.</p><p>Postoperative pulmonary valve insufficiency is a common sequela of transannular patches.
Since pulmonary insufficiency is poorly tolerated in adults, some centers with
experience in dealing with congenital heart disease in this age group are advocating
placing a bioprosthetic valve in those patients requiring a transannular
patch<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. Khan et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> reported 25% of
moderate/severe postoperative pulmonary regurgitation in their study. In this context,
how did they evaluate these patients? How did they follow them? What did they do with
them?</p><p>Even though repairing TOF in adult patients is not a common procedure nowadays due to the
movement of cardiac surgery to the very young, it is very important for all of us to
understand the outcomes related to their treatment. How many of these patients were
truly adults? Knowing the number of patients below 18 years of age would answer this
important question.</p><p>Age definition is a central issue, thus it may not be appropriated to use adults both in
the title and as a keyword for this publication. A word of caution for all of us, a
proper review of the manuscript could have avoided observations like this.</p><sig-block><sig><bold>Luiz Fernando Can&#x000ea;o</bold>, MD, PhD - Instituto do

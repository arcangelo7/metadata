artery supplying the myocardium generally due to atherosclerosis. In most patients, the
first symptom of ischemic heart disease (IHD) is acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Its typical
findings are pressure sensation in the forefront of the chest and the compressing-type pain
creeping the neck, jaw, shoulder and arm. Chronic ischemic coronary artery disease may
progress asymptomatic in some patients and such patients are diagnosed with coronary artery
disease (CAD) through examination made upon any suspicion<sup>[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The incidence of depression and anxiety in patients with ACS is reported to be higher.
Furthermore, fear of death, death-related depressive mood and accordingly a decline in
quality of life (QOL) are observed in these patients<sup>[<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Likewise, coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) requirement also
constitutes a factor leading to depression, anxiety, development of fear of death and
decreased QOL<sup>[<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. CABG is both physical and
psychological stressor. Patients consider this surgery as a life-threatening condition and a
source of stress which will significantly impair their normal daily life pattern<sup>[<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. This stress may lead to depression, anxiety
and fear of death, and impairs the QOL. In addition to some patients experiencing the stress
caused by both ACS and CABG, there are some other who do not have ACS and ACS-related
stress, but suffering only from the stress of CABG.</p><p>There is substantial evidence that depression is associated with morbidity and mortality in
cardiac patients<sup>[<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. It is reported that
the prevalence of depression before CABG is in the range of 20-47%<sup>[<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>During the preparation for the surgery following the decision to proceed with bypass
surgery; Beck depression scale (BDS), Beck hopelessness scale, Templer death anxiety scale
and death depression scale, State-Trait anxiety inventory and WHOQOL-Bref QOL scale were
performed. These scales applied in the study were validated and translated into Turkish
language. Turkish language is the local language of the study group.</p><p>BDS is among the most commonly-used scales in mental health screening and researches on
depression. A high total score indicates a high level or severity of depression. The BDS
scores of 17 and above would identify a depression severe enough to require treatment with
90% accuracy<sup>[<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Templer's Death Anxiety Scale aimed at determining the level of death anxiety including a
total of 15 items. Modelling some studies in the literature on his dissertation, it was
transformed into a seven-point Likert scale and adapted to our population with the aim of a
more robust measurement. Death Depression Scale was developed in 1990 by Templer. It aims to
measure the mood states such as depression, sadness, loneliness, fear and grief experienced
in relation to death. After its implementation, at least 0 and at most 17 points can be
obtained. A score between 0 and 8 indicates no depressive mood whereas a score between 9 and
17 indicates a depressive mood - the higher the score, the more severe the
depression<sup>[<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)-I, STAI-II scale was developed by
Spielberger<sup>[<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>. It consisted of State
Anxiety Inventory and the Trait Anxiety Inventory, each with 20 items. The scores range from
20 (low anxiety) to 80 (high anxiety). It indicates no anxiety between points 36 and below,
a slight anxiety between 37-42 and high anxiety between 43 and above. Overall, a high state
and trait anxiety score shows a high level of anxiety, and it is stated that the individuals
with scores above 60 need a professional help.</p><p>WHOQOL-Bref Quality of Life Scale was developed by the World Health Organization and
consists of 26 items through which the overall perceived QOL is questioned. The study
includes the sections of physical health, mental health, social health and environmental
health. Physical health section includes the questions designated for investigating ability
to perform everyday tasks, dependence on medication and treatment, vitality and fatigue,
mobility, pain and discomfort, sleep and rest and ability to work whereas mental health
section includes questions related to positive and negative emotions, self-esteem, body
image and appearance, personal beliefs and attention, and social section includes questions
related to relationships with other people, social support and sexual life, and finally,
environment and national environmental section includes questions related to home
environment, physical security and safety, financial resources, opportunity to receive
health services, physical environment and transport. The higher the score obtained in the
scale, the higher the QOL.</p><p>It was observed that, in terms of depression, anxiety and fear of death, there are some
differences between the patients with ACS for whom a bypass surgery is projected and those
who were diagnosed with IHD in consequence of their consultation due to other medical
reasons and for whom a bypass surgery is projected. We hypothesized that experiencing ACS
prior to open heart surgery may affect the psychiatric status of those patients. The aim of
this study is to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between
these two groups in terms of depression, anxiety, level of hope for the future, fear of
death and QOL. To our knowledge, our study is the first study in the literature on this
subject.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>The study population included 63 patients who underwent a primary CABG under elective
conditions between January 2015 and January 2016 in the cardiovascular surgery clinic. The
patients were divided into two groups: those diagnosed after experiencing an ACS (Group 1)
and those diagnosed without an ACS (Group 2). Group 1 consisted of the patients for whom a
bypass surgery is to be performed after an ACS. Group 2 was, however, consisted of the
patients for whom a bypass surgery is decided to be performed with the diagnosis of ischemic
heart disease as a result of examinations made upon patients' consultation to the hospital
due to other medical reasons upon suspicion.</p><p>As a result of interviews conducted with patients, those with previous psychiatric symptoms
or treatment history, those who had previously undergone a heart surgery and those for whom
an emergency surgery is planned were excluded. We excluded the patients who have previous
psychiatric history because of this history could confound the psychiatric states of
patients and for most truly examination of the only CABG's effect on psychiatric
statement.</p><p>In addition, the personal information form created by researchers and containing data such
as age, gender, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD), smoking, peripheral arterial disease (PAD), left main coronary artery
disease (LMCA), ejection fraction (EF) and the number of vessels bypassed was completed for
each patient.</p><p>BDS is among the most commonly-used scales in mental health screening and researches on
depression. A high total score indicates a high level or severity of depression. In her
validity and reliability study, Hisli<sup>[<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>
determined the cut-off as 17 points, and reported that the BDS scores of 17 and above would
identify a depression severe enough to require treatment with 90% accuracy.</p><p>Beck Hopelessness Scale aimed at determining the level of pessimism about the future of an
individual. The high scores show that the hopelessness of the individual is high. The scale
is composed of three factors including "Future-Related Emotions", "Loss of Motivation" and
"Future-Related Expectations". Beck et al.<sup>[<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> classified the subjects in four groups according to their responses and
reported no hopelessness in 0 to 3, slight hopelessness in 4 to 8, moderate hopelessness in
9 to 14 and severe hopelessness in 15 to 20. The validity and reliability study was
performed by Durak &#x00026; Palab&#x00131;y&#x00131;ko&#x0011f;lu<sup>[<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>, in 1994. The high scores show that the hopelessness of the
individual is high. The scale is composed of three factors, including "Future-Related
Emotions", "Loss of Motivation" and "Future-Related Expectations".</p><p>Templer's Death Anxiety Scale aimed at determining the level of death anxiety, including a
total of 15 items. Modelling some studies in the literature on his dissertation,
Ertufan<sup>[<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> transformed it into a
seven-point Likert scale and adapted to Turkish with the aim of to become a more robust
measurement.</p><p>Death Depression Scale was developed in 1990 by Templer and the study of validity and
reliability of the scale in Turkey was performed by Yaparel &#x00026;
Y&#x00131;ld&#x00131;z<sup>[<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>. It aims to
measure the mood states such as depression, sadness, loneliness, fear and grief experienced
in relation to death. After its implementation, at least 0 and at most 17 points can be
obtained. A score between 0 and 8 indicates no depressive mood whereas a score between 9 and
17 indicates a depressive mood - the higher the score, the more severe the
depression<sup>[<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>STAI-I, STAI-II scale was developed by Spielberger<sup>[<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>. It consisted of State Anxiety Inventory and the Trait Anxiety
Inventory, each with 20 items. &#x000d6;ner &#x00026; LeCompte translated the scale into Turkish
and performed its validity and reliability study<sup>[<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>WHOQOL-Bref Quality of Life Scale was developed by the World Health Organization and
consists of 26 items through which the overall perceived QOL is questioned. Eser et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> performed the study of
validity and reliability of the scale in Turkey. The higher the score obtained in the scale,
the higher the QOL.</p><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The data were expressed as the mean &#x000b1; standard deviation. Intergroup comparison
was performed with the Mann-Whitney U-test. Comparisons of categorical variables were made
using a chi-square test. Student's t-test was used for comparison of continuous data.
Spearman correlation analysis was used to measure the strength of association between
variables. The data were examined using SPSS 20 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

prepared for a bypass surgery, regardless of whether or not they are diagnosed with ACS,
were found to be depressed and hopeless about the future and their levels of anxiety were
found to be high.</p><p>Although no significant difference was found between the two groups in terms of the means
of total score's obtained from BDS; we assessed the all patient's depressive levels
according to the BDS points. According to the BDS scores; 28 of 63 patients obtained a score
17 and above while 14 patients scored between 12 and 17. So, 42 of 63 patients have major or
minor levels of depressive symptoms. These scores suggest that the majority of the patients
have depressive symptoms. According to the STAI's scores, anxiety levels were found to be
significantly higher in all of the patients in both groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Most of the patients hospitalized for CABG experience various emotions ranging from a
slight fear to anxiety, depression and fear of death<sup>[<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>. According to Spielberger<sup>[<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>, anxiety is an unpleasant emotional state or condition which is
characterized by subjective feelings of tension, apprehension and worry and by activation or
arousal of the autonomic nervous system. Koivula et al.<sup>[<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> stated that waiting for CABG makes many patients more disturbed than
their chest pain. Arthur et al.<sup>[<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>
described that long wait for CABG can result in deterioration of patient's emotional state
and physical activity. Moderate anxiety before major surgery is a normal emotion as it
prepares the organism for the coming stress situation<sup>[<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>. However, intense fear and anxiety are especially detrimental to
cardiac patients because of the activation of sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous
systems and cardiovascular excitation<sup>[<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Psychological problems such as depression and anxiety are widely reported soon after CABG
surgery and remain evident for around one-fifth of patients one year after
surgery<sup>[<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>. There are many studies assessing patients' level of depression and
anxiety<sup>[<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup>. However, the number of
studies in which patients' level of preoperative depression, hopelessness and deathrelated
anxiety as well as their relation to the QOL are assessed, are relatively limited. In our
study, the scores from death anxiety scale of both groups are high. The idea of undergoing a
CABG increased patient death anxiety independent of whether they have ACS previously or
not.</p><p>Patients in both groups have received high scores from death depression scale, in a level
indicating the presence of a depressive mood. Although the total DDS score was found to be
higher in the first group compared to that of the second group, there was no significant
difference between the two groups. Being about to undergo a bypass surgery both increase
patients' death anxiety and creates a depressed mood related to the death.</p><p>Measured on the Spielberger State of Anxiety Scale (STAI-S) the prevalence of anxiety
ranged between 22% and 48% in patients with CAD, prior to heart surgery<sup>[<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup>. Different studies show a moderate degree of
anxiety (score on STAI-S 35.6-49.8) after myocardial infarction, before heart
surgery<sup>[<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup>. In the study that evaluates the anxiety level of 190 patients one day
before the CABG, the STAI mean score was found to be 35.8&#x000b1;10.4<sup>[<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup>. State and trait anxiety scores of our
patients were found to be higher compared to this study.</p><p>It is known, patients experiencing level of preoperative distress were more likely to
report decrements in several domains of QOL after their operation<sup>[<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup>. Better QOL was associated with lower anxiety
level<sup>[<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup>. An increasing body of
research evidence shows that the waiting period is difficult for patients. It has been found
that waiting for surgery impairs the QOL for patients on the waiting list<sup>[<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup>. It has been found that during the waiting
period to CABG patients suffer from impaired functional status, anxiety, depression and fear
of death, and that the situation also adversely affects the patient's family and social
relations<sup>[<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup>. It was also determined
in our study that the QOL of the patients with ACS was mentally significantly impaired
compared to those who do not have ACS.</p><p>The sample size in our study constitutes a limitation for our study. However, this is the
first study to explore whether there is a difference between the patients with ACS and those
without ACS, both prepared to a CABG, in terms of depression, anxiety, and the level of
hope, death-related anxiety and QOL.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, depression, anxiety, hopelessness, deathrelated depression and anxiety level
of the patients who will undergo an open heart surgery is high and the QOL in these patients
is affected by this situation when both groups are considered together. But unexpectedly
there are no differences in terms of depression, hopelessness, anxiety and fear of death.
Also ACS before CABG impairs more the QOL in mental terms compared to those without ACS.</p><table-wrap id="t5" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="10%" span="1"/><col width="90%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors&#x02019; roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">VY</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Conception and study design; analysis and/or data interpretation;

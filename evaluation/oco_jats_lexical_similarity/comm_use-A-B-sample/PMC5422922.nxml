However, the long-term impact of prenatal stress (PS) and disrupted glucocorticoid signaling on bone mass and strength is not understood. In contrast, the detrimental effect of lead (Pb) on skeletal health is well documented. As stress and Pb act on common biological targets via glucocorticoid signaling pathways and co-occur in the environment, this study first sought to assess the combined effect of stress and Pb on bone quality in association with alterations in glucocorticoid signaling. Bone parameters were evaluated using microCT, histomorphometry, and strength determination in 8-month-old male mouse offspring subjected to PS on gestational days 16 and 17, lifetime Pb exposure (100&#x02009;p.p.m. Pb in drinking water), or to both. Pb reduced trabecular bone mass and, when combined with PS, Pb unmasked an exaggerated decrement in bone mass and tensile strength. Next, to characterize a mechanism of glucocorticoid effect on bone, prednisolone was implanted subcutaneously (controlled-release pellet, 5&#x02009;mg&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> per day) in 5-month-old mice that decreased osteoblastic activity and increased sclerostin and leptin levels. Furthermore, the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone alters the anabolic Wnt signaling pathway. The Wnt pathway inhibitor sclerostin has several glucocorticoid response elements, and dexamethasone administration to osteoblastic cells induces sclerostin expression. Dexamethasone treatment of isolated bone marrow cells decreased bone nodule formation, whereas removal of sclerostin protected against this decrement in mineralization. Collectively, these findings suggest that bone loss associated with steroid-induced osteoporosis is a consequence of sclerostin-mediated restriction of Wnt signaling, which may mechanistically facilitate glucocorticoid toxicity in bone.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Stress and sustained elevation of stress-related hormones like cortisol, which are associated with a variety of disorders and diseases are more prevalent among communities with low socioeconomic status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1 bib2 bib3">1&#x02013;3</xref></sup> Elevated stress can occur at any period throughout life. An individual&#x02019;s allostatic load produced by prolonged or repeated stress challenges creates physiological changes and altered neuroendocrine responses that modify health outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> Importantly, the consequences of sustained stress, especially in the case of prenatal stress (PS), have been reported to produce enduring deleterious effects in offspring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> and considered a mechanism by which adult diseases are programmed.</p><p>Glucocorticoids (GC) are synthesized and secreted by the adrenal glands and have substantial impact on the physiological functioning of several body systems, including metabolism, adaptation to stress events and modulation of host defense, the later being particularly important in consideration of therapeutic administration of GC. The signaling axis of GC consists of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and is influenced by a multitude of factors including neuroinflammation, physical stress, circadian rhythm, and negative feedback. Self-attenuation of GC signaling on GC receptors in the hippocampus, hypothalamus and pituitary gland is designed to stabilize the response.</p><p>In regard to skeletal health, there are a number of human and non-human primate studies to suggest that PS can effect physical changes in bone growth and birth complications of offspring.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> PS is reported to decrease birth weight and gestational length,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> decrease bone density,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> and to increase marrow adiposity later in life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> These effects have been attributed to several factors. Chronic PS and prolonged maternal HPA activation can exceed the enzymatic placental barrier, therefore exposing the fetus to increased GC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> Elevated levels of maternal GC may disrupt central mediators of growth in the offspring by damaging the fetal HPA axis. It has been demonstrated that GC (PS or dexamethasone given prenatally) have significant consequences for bone later in life, specifically stunting bone growth in male rats preferentially over female rats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12 bib13 bib14 bib15">12&#x02013;15</xref></sup> Despite the accumulating evidence of long-term consequences of PS on skeletal outcomes and the conceivability of relevant pathways that may influence bone structure, mechanistic understanding of the effects of PS exposure on bone quality is limited.</p><p>Lead (Pb) exposure similarly acts on the HPA axis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16 bib17 bib18">16&#x02013;18</xref></sup> and has substantial influence on bone density and quality outcomes in rodents and humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19 bib20 bib21">19&#x02013;21</xref></sup> Sustained hypercortisolism by Pb or stress, or as established when given a regimen of GC therapy, produces a skeletal imbalance and precipitous bone loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> The incidence of secondary osteoporosis with excessive GC is well described and recognized in the literature;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22 bib23 bib24">22&#x02013;24</xref></sup> however, the mechanisms of GC action are less understood. The primary source of GC-induced bone loss is thought to be direct inhibitory effects on osteoblast activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup></p><p>As the Wnt pathway is critical for bone formation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> this study aimed to investigate a mechanism of GC impingement upon Wnt signaling. GC have been associated with inhibition of Wnt signaling in relation to decreased bone formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26 bib27 bib28 bib29">26&#x02013;29</xref></sup> and increased bone marrow adiposity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29 bib30 bib31 bib32">29&#x02013;32</xref></sup> An antagonist of Wnt signaling, sclerostin, is secreted by osteocytes and is a potent inhibitor of osteoblastic mineralization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> Several studies have reported a rise in sclerostin (scl) and dickoff-1 (Dkk-1) expression in rodents and cell culture systems following GC treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34 bib35 bib36 bib37 bib38">34&#x02013;38</xref></sup> Yet, the evidence for a substantial link in human patients has been discordant with decreased serum sclerostin at one week in GC patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref></sup> and increased serum sclerostin at later time points.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> Similar disparities are seen with sclerostin and disease states: increased levels are reported in Cushing&#x02019;s syndrome patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup> whereas cases of chronic hypercortisolism presented with decreased sclerostin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> Sclerostin activity as a means for heavy metals to facilitate osteoporotic bone loss was first established in animal systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43 bib44 bib45">43&#x02013;45</xref></sup> and their association was recently revealed in osteoporotic patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref></sup></p><p>Based on these concerns, the objective of this study was to assess multivariable exposure to gain new insights into bone-specific effects by both maternal stress and Pb through overlapping GC mechanisms. In addition, we explored a mechanism involving induction of sclerostin as a facilitator of the negative effects of GC on bone quality. Finally, we examined whether the inhibitory effects of GC on bone mineralization were counteracted by removal of sclerostin.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>PS model and Pb dosing</title><p>The University of Rochester Medical Center IACUC approved all animal studies. Four-week-old female C57BL/6 mice (Charles River) were randomly assigned to receive drinking water containing 0 or 100&#x02009;p.p.m. Pb acetate (100 Pb). Pb exposure was initiated 2 months prior to breeding to ensure elevated Pb body burden at the time of conception. At proestrus, as determined by vaginal smears, female mice were mated with males (2:1) across two estrous cycles. The presence of vaginal plugs or sperm was considered indicative of pregnancy and deemed gestational day (GD) 1. Pregnant females were then randomly subdivided to a nonstress (NS) or PS condition.</p><p>On GD16 and GD17, timed to correspond to the development of key brain regions (hypothalamic nuclei, hippocampus, striatum, frontal cortex),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref></sup> the dams were weighed and those in the PS groups were subjected to a widely employed restraint stress procedure consisting of three 45&#x02009;min restraint sessions (9:00, 12:00 and 15:00) in plastic cylindrical devices,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref></sup> a protocol that is verified to elevate corticosterone levels and alter catecholamine levels in the frontal cortex and nucleus accumbens of dams.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref></sup> The NS dams were weighed and subsequently left undisturbed in their home cages.

Images were reconstructed to an isotropic voxel size of 15&#x02009;&#x003bc;m and selected based on mean BV/TV value. For analyses of trabecular bone, we selected a region equivalent to 8% of the femur height, 1.06&#x02009;mm in total, beginning 0.3&#x02009;mm from the most proximal aspect of the growth plate. Trabecular bone within the distal femur and proximal tibia was segmented from the cortex using a semi-automated contouring algorithm in the axial plane. We conducted thresholding according to 220 Scanco proprietary guidelines (&#x02212;1 000/+1 000).

Destructive three-point bending of right femurs was conducted with the anterior surface in tension at a displacement rate of 3&#x02009;mm&#x000b7;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. The span between the two lower supports was set at 8&#x02009;mm. Maximum load, yield load, material stiffness, and energy absorption data were generated from the load-displacement curve for each specimen (Instron 4465/5500, High Wycombe, United Kingdom).</p></sec><sec><title>Bone histomorphometry and immunostaining</title><p>Extracted skeletal elements were fixed in 10% formalin for 4 days. Bones were decalcified for 2 weeks in 14% EDTA. Specimens were then processed, embedded in paraffin, and medial sections were obtained with a HM355S microtome (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) using stainless steel blade at a thickness of three microns. The first three LV (LV1&#x02013;3) were sectioned longitudinally. Tissue sections were stained with Alcian blue and counterstained with hematoxylin, orange G, and eosin (ABH) for analysis of bone properties.

PS produced no significant reduction in trabecular bone volume of the tibia as indicated previously. However in Pb-exposed mice, there was a consistent 32.6% decrease in bone volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The trabecular volume loss was greater when Pb was combined with PS, as revealed by a 56.0% decrease compared with the water control group. Adipocytes composed 39.3% of the total bone marrow volume in NS mice. Fatty marrow was increased by 1.48-fold in Pb alone, and 1.53-fold in Pb+PS compared with NS mice. Adipocytes were larger in Pb-exposed mice by 1.20-fold, and further increased in Pb+PS mice by 1.51-fold compared with water controls. Measurements of osteoclast number and surface area were found to be unaltered among all groups. However, the number of osteoblasts was reduced 20.6% after exposure to Pb and by 28.8% in Pb+PS mice compared with controls. These data suggest that a primary contributor to the decline in trabecular bone could occur through an effect on the osteoblastic and adipogenic populations.</p><p>Serum levels of P1NP and CTx-1 were measured to assess relative activity of osteoblast and osteoclasts in attempt to determine the basis for the synergistic effect of Pb and PS (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).

Upon examining Wnt antagonist molecules, levels of Dkk-1 were not significantly influence by Pb, PS, or the combination. On the other hand, levels of sclerostin were increased by 1.5-fold in Pb-treated mice, and in PS mice exposed to Pb there was a significant interaction of Pb and PS, as seen with a 2.1-fold induction of sclerostin compared with controls.</p></sec><sec><title>GC treatment produces a decrease in bone formation and elevation of sclerostin</title><p>To study GC signaling and effects on bone formation, prednisolone pellets were implanted in adult mice.

Yet the effect of GCs on osteoblasts and bone mineralization are convoluted, exhibiting both negative and positive effects depending on the steroid concentration, cell differentiation state, and species. Our findings presented here suggest that disruption of the HPA axis and resulting hypercortisolism resulting from stress due to maternal movement restriction has limited effects on bone mass and trabecular bone, though, noticeable deficits in cortical bone length and strength. And yet, when PS was combined with lifetime Pb exposure, there were enhanced impairments in trabecular bone properties normally associated with Pb treatment alone. Greater decrements were similarly found in the number of osteoblasts and in biomechanical properties in the Pb+PS group, with a significant interaction between the study variables. No new findings were revealed with Pb treatment alone in this study. However, these are the first studies to examine two co-occurring environmental factors, Pb and stress, both that have recognized endocrine disruption and detrimental effects on human bone health.</p><p>The precise method of PS effects on bone was not explored here, but we previously reported a prolonged stress response and elevated cortisol levels upon HPA axis disruption by both PS and Pb exposure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16 bib17 bib18">16&#x02013;18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref></sup> In particular, developmental Pb exposure permanently alters HPA axis function producing sustained hypercortisolism and altered GC negative feedback. In addition, interruption of bone development has been reported as a consequence of Pb and stress, which in this study, the endocrine changes ultimately produce deficits in bone strength and bone quality later in life. It cannot be discounted that maternal stress and Pb share a number of biological substrates and effects beyond the HPA axis, including deficits in catecholamine systems, behavior responses, and cognition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60 bib61 bib62 bib63">60&#x02013;63</xref></sup> that may also influence skeletal health.</p><p>Another objective of this study was to describe the molecular mechanism by which GCs depress bone mineralization. We presented evidence that GCs mediate their effects through sclerostin antagonism of &#x003b2;-catenin signaling. GCs may increase apoptosis of osteoblasts, but also impingement on the Wnt signaling pathway has been shown to inhibit osteoblast differentiation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">64</xref></sup> a phenomenon that is abrogated with silencing Dkk-1 expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">65</xref></sup> The majority of these studies examined changes in Wnt antagonist levels systemically, whereas this report focused on sclerostin modulation in osteoblastic cells and in bone tissue directly, in addition to sclerostin expression peripherally. Sclerostin and prednisolone were elevated in response to dexamethasone in culture within 24&#x02009;h, both after initial treatment, and sustained levels out to 48 days post treatment.</p><p>We posit that elevation of sclerostin by GC signaling is a mechanism for homeostatic bone uncoupling, producing loss of bone mass. Previous reports have linked disruption of Wnt signaling in the prednisolone model as an important mediator of the pathophysiology of GC-induced osteoporosis (GIOP).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">66</xref></sup> In addition, we observed an increase in leptin protein corresponding with loss of osteoblast activity observed by a decrease in P1NP levels and reduced bone formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref></sup> Leptin acts negatively on bone formation through the sympathetic nervous system via adrenergic signaling on osteoblasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">67</xref></sup> Sympathetic neuronal control of bone, through molecules such as GC and subsequently leptin, can differentially regulate cancellous verse compact bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67 bib68 bib69">67&#x02013;69</xref></sup> Therefore it is plausible that disruptions caused by the PS model could alter cortical bone over cancellous bone through leptin and result in decreased bone mineral strength, though further investigations are necessary. The significant decrease in cortical strength in PS mice could not be delineated due to its effect on bone geometry or bone quality. The primary effect of GC is theorized to be suppression of osteoblast activity, and yet, GC temporarily induced osteoclastogenesis. Similar accounts have been documented in both clinical and animal studies that have shown a reduction in the level of osteoprotegerin, an antagonist of receptor activator of NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B ligand (RANKL) stimulation of osteoclast differentiation, in the initial stage of GC treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">71</xref></sup></p><p>Another finding apropos of the sclerostin-mediated inhibition of Wnt signaling is that PS, Pb, and prednisolone have recently been described to divert bone marrow stromal cells to form increasing numbers of adipocytes at the expense of osteoblasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">73</xref></sup> These reports indicate that prolonged exposure to GC and Pb shunts the differentiation potential toward an adipogenic lineage through increasing master regulators of adipogenesis, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-&#x003b3; and C/EBP, and decreasing the osteogenic regulator Runx2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">74</xref></sup> The important pathway gatekeeping this bifurcation is Wnt signaling,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75 bib76 bib77">75&#x02013;77</xref></sup> in which suppression of Wnt signaling is consistent with promotion of adipocyte formation. In our animal models, Pb produced a profound increase in fatty marrow composition, and we observed increases in adipocytes, the adipokine leptin, and C/EBP as a consequence of GC treatment, which may be indicative of an increase in adipogenesis and body fat stores.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">78</xref></sup></p><p>In osteoblast cultures, GCs have been shown to strongly reduce mineral matrix formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">80</xref></sup> At the molecular level, this is proposed to be a result of apoptotic stimulation, impeded cell cycle progression and downregulation of important osteoblastic genes such as <italic>Runx2</italic>, type 1 collagen, <italic>ALP</italic>, and osteocalcin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> While we found that the apoptotic marker caspase 3 and cell number were not different from controls following Dex treatment at 21 days (data not shown), alizarin red staining was significantly reduced. However, when Dex treatment was administered in sclerostin-deficient cells, osteoblastic mineralization was restored. This result was independent of earlier alterations in osteoblastogenesis as demonstrated by the removal of sclerostin having no relevant alteration in antecedent ALP activity. This points to the fact that sclerostin may play a pertinent role in later stage osteoblasts with GC inhibition of mineralization.</p><p>Both GC and Pb have particular significance to human health, as GC therapy is the most common promoter of secondary osteoporosis and Pb is persistent in the environment. The present findings illustrate the effects of GC with Pb exposure through sclerostin-mediated action on bone mineralization. Much work needs to be done to substantiate whether this novel target of intervention may provide a protective effect on bone health and GIOP. The enhancements observed with maternal stress and lifetime Pb exposure highlight the need to examine risk factors with relevant modifiers that co-exist with high frequency in various socioeconomic groups.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank R Tierney and S Mack for assistance with histology, R Gelein for bone Pb measurements, and M Thullen for microCT imaging and analysis.

As the global prevalence of obesity continues to increase <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, disorders of the musculoskeletal system are expected to become more common especially in older populations at highest risk of these conditions <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, as excessive body weight may cause deleterious alterations to the structure of the bones and joints <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>The relationship between obesity and chronic musculoskeletal conditions in adulthood has been widely studied. Epidemiological evidence has demonstrated that obesity is an important risk factor for development of knee <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, and hand osteoarthritis (OA) <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, with less consistent findings for hip OA <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Obesity is also associated with increased risk of ankle and upper leg fractures <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, whereas low BMI has been associated with increased risk of hip fracture in women <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. However, many of the studies examining associations of BMI with musculoskeletal outcomes have relied on the assessment of BMI at a single time-point. An exception are prior findings from the MRC National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD) that have shown associations of prolonged exposure to high BMI with increased risk of knee OA at age 53 <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, and decreased risk of low hip bone mineral density (BMD) <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>The gross morphology of the proximal femur is a recognised factor in both hip OA and femoral neck fracture. Hip morphometry has traditionally used geometrical measures <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, but recent studies using statistical shape modelling (SSM) have shown more subtle and coordinated changes in shape that are associated with fracture risk <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In addition, femoro-acetabular impingement, in which there is an incongruence between the shapes of the femoral head and the acetabulum, is increasingly recognised as a risk factor for hip OA <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, and SSM has been able to provide quantitative measures of joint shape associated with risk of its incidence and progression <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>The relationships of BMI and joint shape with musculoskeletal diseases led us to hypothesise that BMI across adulthood may be associated with hip shape with important implications for bone and joint disorders in older adults. It is plausible that excess body weight may influence non-optimal shape of the hip joint via mechanical, inflammatory or other metabolic pathways. However, it is unclear whether associations exist between BMI across adulthood and hip shape in later life. It is also not clear whether greater gains in BMI during certain stages of adulthood or cumulative exposure to high BMI are particularly important. This information may provide insight about the most effective opportunities for intervention.</p><p>We utilised data from the NSHD to examine the relationships between BMI across adulthood and hip shapes at age 60&#x02013;64. We aimed to investigate the associations of hip shapes at age 60&#x02013;64 with: (i) BMI from age 15; (ii) BMI gain during different periods of adulthood, and (iii) length of exposure to overweight during adult life.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Study sample</title><p>The NSHD is a socially stratified sample of 5362 single, legitimate births that occurred in England, Wales and Scotland in one week of March 1946 and participants have been prospectively followed regularly ever since <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Between 2006 and 2010 (at 60&#x02013;64&#x000a0;years), eligible participants known to be alive and living in England, Wales and Scotland were invited for an assessment at one of six clinical research facilities (CRF) or to be visited at home by a research nurse. Of the 2856 invited, 2229 were assessed of whom 1690 attended a CRF. Approval for the study was obtained from the Central Manchester Research Ethics Committee (07/H1008/245) and the Scottish A Research Ethics Committee (08/MRE00/12) and written informed consent was obtained from each participant.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>2.2</label><title>Radiological assessment</title><p>During the CRF visit, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) hip scans were acquired for BMD using a QDR 4500 Discovery scanner (Hologic Inc., Bedford, MA) by trained technicians following standard written and video protocols <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. A single scan of the left hip was performed (unless contra-indicated by a prosthesis in the left hip, in which case the right hip was scanned (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;63)). Individuals were scanned in the supine position with feet rotated internally by 15&#x000b0; and strapped to a foot brace placed centrally between the feet to ensure anteverted femoral was parallel to the table. All scans were assessed for image quality and quantitative analysis by JEA's laboratory.</p><p>For quality assurance, the Hologic Spine Phantom provided by the scanner manufacturer was scanned daily prior to participant scanning and in accordance with manufacturer's protocols, and the results were sent to the coordinating centre once a month for scrutiny <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.

SSM of these images has been described in detail previously <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Briefly, an SSM template consisting of 68 points was utilised. Procrustes transformation rotated and scaled the images before principal component analysis was applied to generate the independent orthogonal modes of variation. Each mode describes in descending order the percentage of variance standardised to a mean of 0 and standard deviation (SD) of 1. The variance was plotted against each mode in a scree plot and from this six modes of variance were selected for study using a cut-off of 5% variance; these six modes together explained 69% of overall shape variance.</p></sec><sec id="s0030"><label>2.4</label><title>Measurement of BMI and overweight history</title><p>Weight and height were measured by nurses using standardised protocols at ages 15, 36, 43, 53 and 60&#x02013;64&#x000a0;years and self-reported at ages 20 and 26. BMI (weight (kg)&#x000a0;/&#x000a0;height (m<sup>2</sup>)) was then calculated at each age. BMI measures from age 20 were used to derive a variable with 6 categories indicating the age an individual first became overweight (i.e. BMI&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;25&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) as follows: 20 or 26; 36; 43; 53; 60&#x02013;64; never overweight.</p></sec><sec id="s0035"><label>2.5</label><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Linear regression models were used to investigate associations of BMI at each age (from 15 to 60&#x02013;64) with each hip mode (HM) (aim 1). Tests of deviation from linearity were performed by including quadratic terms and, where evidence of this was found, tests for linear trend across sex-specific fifths were undertaken. At each age the maximum number of participants with valid data at that age were included in the model.</p><p>To investigate whether BMI gain during different periods of adulthood was differentially associated with each HM (aim 2), we first calculated change in BMI in early (20 to 36&#x000a0;years), mid (36 to 53&#x000a0;years) and later adulthood (53 to 60&#x02013;64&#x000a0;years) conditional on earlier BMI by regressing each BMI measure on the earlier measure(s) for each sex and calculating the residuals. The residuals were standardised (mean&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0 and SD&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1) to allow comparability between the different periods <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.

We found that higher BMI and greater BMI gain across adulthood was associated with higher HM2 scores in both sexes. Age at first becoming overweight was non-linearly associated with higher HM2 scores but this association was only retained in men once current BMI was accounted for. In women, there were also associations of higher BMI from age 43 and greater BMI gain in early adulthood with HM3; and for HM5 with higher BMI in early adulthood. In men, there were associations between higher BMI throughout adulthood and lower HM4 scores but no associations with BMI gain or prolonged exposure to high BMI. No clear evidence of associations were found between BMI and HM1 or HM6.</p></sec><sec id="s0085"><label>4.2</label><title>Explanation of findings</title><p>In our study, positive HM2 scores reflect a shorter femoral neck and wider and flatter femoral head (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a, Table S1). These shapes are similar in appearance to those described for a cam or mixed femoro-acetabular impingement (FAI) which, in turn, may indicate a higher risk of OA. A cam FAI is characterised by thicker cortex in the lateral femoral neck resembling a &#x02018;pistol-grip&#x02019; deformity <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, more common in men <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>We found higher BMI at all ages, greater BMI gain until midlife, and younger age at first becoming overweight (independent of current BMI) to be associated with higher HM2 scores in men. In women, similar trends were evident except for age at becoming overweight which was explained by current BMI. That associations of age overweight with HM2 were fully attenuated after adjustment for current BMI in women but not in men may be due to stronger tracking of BMI across adulthood in women <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Alternatively, it could be explained by sex differences in body composition; although BMI is a widely used marker of adiposity in adults, higher BMI in earlier adulthood may be indicative of greater muscle mass in men. The consequence of this is that using a cut-point for overweight of &#x02265;&#x000a0;25&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> may have led to the misclassification of men with higher lean mass. This seems to be supported by findings from sensitivity analyses in which there was a non-linear association between age at first becoming obese (BMI&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;30&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and higher HM2 scores in women only which attenuated after adjustment for current BMI (Table S3). In NSHD, detailed measures of body composition were only available at 60&#x02013;64&#x000a0;years; associations observed between BMI and HM2 in men may be driven by lean, rather than fat mass, as further analyses showed a linear association between higher appendicular lean mass and higher HM2 scores in both sexes after adjusting for fat mass, whereas fat mass was associated with higher HM2 scores in women only (after adjusting for appendicular lean mass), (data not shown).</p><p>Our findings of linear associations across the full distribution of BMI also suggest that low BMI may have an effect on hip shape. Intriguingly, the shapes identified by scores at the negative end of HM2 (i.e. longer and thinner femoral necks with a greater neck-shaft angle) are similar to those previously found to confer a greater risk of hip fracture <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In other studies, including measures of BMD and structure further improved the prediction of hip fracture <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, but no corresponding correlation was found with low BMD <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, indicating that shape and BMD may be separately regulated.</p><p>In this study, negative values of HM4 represent flattening of the femoral head and a decrease in neck-shaft angle (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>b), shape changes that have previously been associated with OA <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. We found sex differences in associations of HM4 with BMI at all ages and age first overweight, with much stronger, consistent evidence of associations in men. As for HM2, these differences may be due to sex differences in body composition with associations observed in men potentially related to variations in lean mass. That we also found sex differences with BMI gain in early adulthood lends this further support, as BMI gain in early adulthood in men may reflect the accrual of muscle mass.</p><p>Shapes described by positive scores for HM3 (Fig. S1 and Table S1) are similar to those describing a possible pincer FAI, with a greater extension to the acetabular rim. This is less common than a cam FAI and more common in middle-aged women <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In women, we found strong positive associations of HM3 with higher BMI in later midlife and greater gains in BMI in early adulthood but not with age first overweight. In addition, there was some evidence of associations for HM5 with higher BMI in early adulthood but not with BMI gain or age first overweight. These associations may be explained by BMI gain during childhood and/or puberty which tracked into adulthood. Previous research in this cohort has shown high relative weight in childhood was associated with high BMI in adulthood <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Similarly, other research in NSHD has shown that changes in BMI from childhood to adolescence were associated with knee OA at age 53 <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and with hip BMD in women <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s0090"><label>4.3</label><title>Methodological considerations</title><p>One key strength of this study is the use of a large nationally representative sample of older adults with repeat prospective measurements of BMI at regular intervals across adulthood which were assessed by research nurses at all but two ages.</p><p>Several important limitations must also be considered. Firstly, DXA hip images were captured at a single time-point. Therefore, we are unable to separate age-related morphologic changes from changes that may have occurred as a consequence of joint disorders such as hip OA. Secondly, although the SSM method has previously been used to identify individuals at risk of incidence and progression of hip OA <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, total hip replacement <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, or osteoporotic hip fracture <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, we lack data on these outcomes. This warrants future investigation; the hip shapes associated with obesity in this study have previously been associated with bone and joint disorders <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Thirdly, the amount of pelvic fat will affect the position of the joint between the beam source and the detectors and hence may introduce projection errors affecting the scaling. However, this will have been removed by the scaling process in the Procrustes analysis performed before PCA. In addition, although the feet are positioned routinely in internal rotation, we have no way of controlling for variation in the rotation of the proximal femur. Fourthly, our analyses were minimally adjusted and so findings may be explained by residual confounding by factors such as socioeconomic position, physical activity and BMD. Fourthly, in this cohort few individuals remained underweight (BMI&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;20&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) across adulthood whereby we were unable to reliably determine the risk associated with prolonged exposure to underweight. In addition, the measure of overweight history used in these analyses assumed that once an individual became overweight they remained overweight. When this assumption was tested we found it to hold; 79% of those classified as first overweight between ages 20/26 and 53 were overweight at all subsequent assessments. Further sensitivity analyses excluding those participants who were not consistently overweight showed similar associations (data not shown) when compared with findings which included all participants (Table S2), also suggesting that this assumption was reasonably well met. Another limitation is that our analyses were restricted to the sample who attended a CRF as this is where DXA scans were undertaken. It is possible that this restriction may have introduced bias as participants who attended a CRF were less likely to be obese and more likely to be in better health than those who were visited at home <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Lastly, our study population comprised Caucasian men and women in early old age and although we stratified our analyses by sex <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, hip shapes are also likely to vary by age and ethnicity <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. However, a benefit of this is that we can be confident that our findings are not explained by confounding by age or ethnicity and, as the sample has remained broadly representative of the population from which it was drawn <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, they are likely to be generalisable to the UK population born at a similar time.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0095"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results suggest that BMI across adulthood is associated with specific variations in hip shape at age 60&#x02013;64.

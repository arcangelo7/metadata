Thirty anonymised CF and 30 healthy control data sets, as consecutively listed in a database of results collected in a large prospective project investigating the clinimetric and clinical relevance of LCI in CF were used. People with CF were recruited at a routine outpatient visit to the Northern Ireland paediatric and adult CF centres at Belfast Health and Social Care Trust (BHSCT), when clinically stable (no pulmonary exacerbation requiring intravenous antibiotics in the previous 4&#x02005;weeks), between October 2010 and June 2013. Control participants were recruited by means of email circulation among people employed in Queen's University Belfast (QUB) and BHSCT between September 2011 and August 2012.

Although repeatable, LCI shortened to 1/10th of the starting concentration (LCI<sub>1/10</sub>) was less sensitive to lung disease, compared with the other LCI end points. It was, however, still more sensitive than FEV<sub>1</sub>% predicted.</p><p>The &#x02018;standard&#x02019; end point of 1/40th is based on historic studies using nitrogen washout (2.5%) and has not been systematically validated for MBW tests using SF<sub>6</sub>.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> This study aimed to assess the performance of earlier arbitrary end points compared with the &#x02018;standard&#x02019; end point in the SF<sub>6</sub> washout, in an attempt to improve the clinical utility of the MBW test by reducing test duration. Like LCI<sub>1/40</sub>, LCI<sub>1/30</sub> and LCI<sub>1/20</sub> target the flatter tail of the washout curve, making it unsurprising that similar information can be obtained (see online supplementary file 2). In contrast, when using LCI<sub>1/10,</sub> the end point occurs before the washout curve flattens. This supports the theory that most information is contained in the tail of the washout curve.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Therefore a cut-off before this point may provide less information about lung disease severity, as highlighted by the lower sensitivity of LCI<sub>1/10</sub> in this study<sub>.</sub> Yammine <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> assessed the repeatability and sensitivity of shortened N<sub>2</sub> MBW to measure LCI, at a number of earlier end points including 1/20th of the starting concentration and as early as 1/5th of the starting concentration, in 68 children with CF (n=44 with mild disease). In agreement with results from our study, they reported good performance of shortened LCI at 1/20th of the starting concentration compared with &#x02018;standard&#x02019; LCI. Furthermore, as with the results from our study, Yammine <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> found that while the earlier LCI end points had good intravisit repeatability, they were less sensitive and specific to the presence of CF. The authors concluded that shortened N<sub>2</sub> MBW to 1/20th of the starting concentration could offer a more feasible measure for use in clinical practice. In this study we extended these observations to investigate and confirm the utility of shortened ventilation indices in older patients with more advanced disease. Theoretically, in cases of severe flow asynchrony between the best and the least ventilated lung units, the end-tidal concentrations in subsequent breathing cycles can enhance the contribution of the least ventilated units toward the end of the washout where LCI is measured.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> This may lead to increased variation in results taken at an earlier end point, such as 1/20th of the starting concentration. In contrast, LCI from an earlier end point may be more precise, as an end point where the washout curve slope is greater may avoid random breath-by-breath variability that could be observed at a later end point. In this study, LCI<sub>1/30</sub> and LCI<sub>1/20</sub> had marginally better sensitivity to the presence of CF (23% vs 20%), compared with LCI<sub>1/40</sub>, even though there was no significant difference in variability (LCI CV%) between &#x02018;standard&#x02019; LCI (LCI<sub>1/40</sub>) and LCI at an earlier end point (LCI<sub>1/30</sub>, LCI<sub>1/20</sub>, LCI<sub>1/10</sub>). LCI<sub>1/30</sub> and LCI<sub>1/20</sub> also had good diagnostic performance and superior sensitivity compared with FEV<sub>1</sub>% predicted. Importantly, these findings indicate that no further additional information was obtained using LCI<sub>1/40</sub> compared with the shortened versions, LCI<sub>1/30</sub> and LCI<sub>1/20</sub>.</p><p>Test duration for LCI<sub>1/30</sub>, LCI<sub>1/20</sub> and LCI<sub>1/10</sub> was significantly shorter than LCI<sub>1/40</sub> in people with CF, with an average 5%, 9% and 15% time saving, respectively. As LCI<sub>1/20</sub> offers a greater time saving than LCI<sub>1/30,</sub> while maintaining reliability and sensitivity, it provides the most attractive measure and may enhance the feasibility of MBW in the research and clinical setting. The proportion of time saved in this study is smaller than that reported in the study by Yammine <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> as MBW tests using an exogenous gas such as SF<sub>6</sub> require a washin and a washout phase. However, as these results are from a retrospective analysis, the time saving measurement does not take into account the total time saving per testing session. Finishing a test earlier would allow for the second and third test of the triplicate to start sooner, resulting in a larger time saving. Although the washin time is unchanged, any shortening of LCI test duration could be especially useful in younger children where long assessment periods are not feasible, and in patients with advanced disease, where the washin and/or washout periods can be prolonged. The use of MBW equipment using SF<sub>6</sub> has been successfully used in multicentre studies and remains popular as it has advantages in terms of tracer gas estimation (measured directly rather than by subtraction as with N<sub>2</sub> MBW) avoiding the potential confounding effects of 100% O<sub>2</sub> on breathing pattern. This study is the first to show that MBW using SF<sub>6</sub> can be reliably shortened.</p><p>Considering potential limitations of shortened MBW tests, one study highlights that advanced analysis of washout curves to determine the relative contribution of convective and acinar airways to ventilation heterogeneity (phase III analysis) usually requires six lung-volume turnovers.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> However, recent work suggests that the same information may be obtainable in three lung-volume turnovers<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> in which case use of LCI<sub>1/20</sub> would still enable full phase III analysis. Regardless, phase III indices may have limited utility in CF, as demonstrated by Horsley <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>The retrospective nature of this study is a limitation. However, the study did endeavour to avoid selection bias by use of anonymsied patient data sets as consecutively listed in a database and represents the first exploratory study to report on the clinimetric properties of an earlier end point in SF<sub>6</sub> MBW. More data from across the disease severity range in CF are required to define normal ranges of shortened LCI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>LCI<sub>1/20</sub> is a repeatable and sensitive test with equal diagnostic performance to LCI<sub>1/40</sub> that is shorter, potentially offering a more feasible research and clinical measure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjresp-2014-000031-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1487" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjresp-2014-000031-s2.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1492" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the patients and families who participated in this study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> KO'N recruited patients, collected clinical data, conducted MBW tests and performed lung function assessment; KO'N, DH, JSE and NB analysed data; IB provided statistical analysis support; KO'N, DH, JMB, NB and JSE wrote the paper.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Funding:</bold> Work funded by HSC Research and Development, Public Health Agency, Northern Ireland and the Medical Research Council through a US-Ireland Partnership Grant.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Competing interests:</bold> None.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Patient consent:</bold> Obtained.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Ethics approval:</bold> This study was approved by the Office for Research Ethics Committees Northern Ireland (ORECNI) (REC reference number: 10/NIR01/41) and co-sponsored by BHSCT and QUB (research office reference number: 10067SE-OPMS).</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Provenance and peer review:</bold> Not commissioned; externally peer reviewed.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gustafsson</surname><given-names>PM</given-names></name><name><surname>Aurora</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Lindblad</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group>. <article-title>Evaluation of ventilation maldistribution as an early indicator of lung disease in children with cystic fibrosis</article-title>. <source>Eur Respir J</source>

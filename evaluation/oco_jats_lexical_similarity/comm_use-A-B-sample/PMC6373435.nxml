These molecules may promote drug absorption by several different processes, including solubilization, increased membrane fluidity, and increased paracellular transport through opening of the tight junctions. Therefore, understanding the aggregation behavior of MCFAs is important. A number of studies have measured the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of MCFAs experimentally. However, CMC is highly dependent on system conditions like pH, temperature, and the ionic strength of the buffer used in different experimental techniques. In this study, we investigated the aggregation behavior of four different MCFAs using the coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) simulations with the purpose to explore if CG-MD can be used to study MCFA interactions occurring in water. The ratio of deprotonated and non-charged MCFA molecules were manipulated to assess aggregation behavior under different pH conditions and within the box sizes of 22&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;22&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;44&#x000a0;nm<sup>3</sup> and 44&#x000a0;nm<sup>3</sup> for 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;s. CMCs were calculated by performing CG-MD simulations with an increasing number of MCFAs. The resulting aggregate size distribution and number of free MCFA molecules were used to determine the CMC. The CMCs from simulations for C<sub>8</sub>, C<sub>10</sub>, and C<sub>12</sub> were 1.8&#x02013;3.5-fold lower than the respective CMCs determined experimentally by the Wilhelmy method. However, the variation of MCFA aggregate sizes and morphologies at different pH conditions is consistent with previous experimental observation. Overall, this study suggests that CG-MD is suitable for studying colloidal systems including various MCFAs.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1208/s12249-018-1289-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Key Words</title><kwd>medium chain fatty acid</kwd><kwd>aggregation</kwd><kwd>critical micelle concentration</kwd><kwd>coarse-grained molecular dynamics</kwd><kwd>fatty acid aggregation behavior</kwd><kwd>experiment simulation comparison</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Uppsala University</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p id="Par2">One of the most successful approaches in promoting the absorption of poorly soluble drugs through the intestinal epithelium has been the use of lipid-based enhancers primarily based on medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. MCFAs can increase the epithelial flux through transient transcellular perturbation as well as paracellular pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The effect of MCFAs on the intestinal epithelium is transient and rapidly reversible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Therefore, MCFAs are ideal components for transient permeability enhancers for peptides, proteins, macromolecules, and oral formulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Transient permeability enhancers have become an essential component of a number of oral formulations including oral peptide and oligonucleotide dosage forms currently undergoing clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. MCFA and MCFA derivatives are used in solid dosage forms, and is commonly known as a gastrointestinal permeation enhancement technology (GIPET) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It has been tested with various doses with poorly absorbed drugs in 16 Phase I studies for which oral bioavailability of 5&#x02013;13% was observed when GIPET dosage forms were used in comparison to the bioavailability of less than 1% that is typically achieved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, MCFAs are common in food products and may be generated from glycerides during lipid digestion. No significant toxicity effect has been attributed to the use of these lipid-based transient permeability enhancers, even with repeated dosing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">In aqueous solution, fatty acid molecules are able to self-assemble and micelles of various sizes and structures can form depending on fatty acid concentration, which may affect the efficiency of MCFAs as transient permeability enhancers, because free fatty acid monomers present near the intestinal absorption site can directly impact the extent of transient permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to estimate the number of fatty acid monomers in both free and aggregate forms at a given concentration in order to identify the threshold concentration required to enhance absorption. Typically, the critical micelle concentration (CMC) is considered a good criterion for threshold concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, the aggregation behavior and CMC value of different MCFAs are highly dependent on various system properties such as pH, temperature, and ionic strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A large number of studies have investigated aggregation behavior and determined the CMC values of MCFAs using different experimental techniques such as surface tension measurement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], the dye micellization method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], the relative viscosity-based method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], high resolution ultrasonic spectroscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], ion activity measurement, and conductimetry techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. One key observation regarding the experimentally measured values is that CMC values also depend on the methods of measurement: the difference between CMC values measured using different techniques at similar or specific system conditions is relatively large.</p><p id="Par4">Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have shown significant promise for investigating the aggregation behavior of different surfactant molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, the atomistic all atom (AA) model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] in which each atom is represented individually has limited capabilities for measuring equilibrium properties like CMC and aggregate size distribution, since these methods are generally confined to nanosecond time scales and nanometer length scales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Sammalkorpi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] estimated the CMC of sodium hexyl sulfate (S6S) using an atomistic MD simulations with a united atom model. In this system, 200&#x000a0;ns was sufficient for the surfactant model to reach an equilibrium state. For MCFAs and surfactants like sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), such a short time scale is insufficient for fully equilibrating the system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. One approach for extending the box size and time scale of experiments is using coarse-grained (CG) MD simulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In the CG-MD approach, a number of atoms are represented by a single CG bead, which significantly reduces the number of interaction sites in a simulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Therefore, these simulations can be performed for relatively longer times and greater length scales, but at the cost of sacrificing the atomic resolution allowed by the AA model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. CMC values determined using CG-MD for different surfactants like dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and S6S [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], sodium nonyl sulfate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], and SDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] were found to have reasonable agreement with experimental values. Results using the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) also agreed quantitatively with experimental CMC and aggregation number for several surfactants such as octaethylene glycol monooctyl ether, dodecyldimethylamineoxide (DDAO), and <italic>N</italic>-decanoyl-<italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-glucamine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. However, an important limitation of DPD is the limited availability of verified model parameters. In CG-MD, the parameterization issue is greatly reduced by, <italic>e.g.</italic>, the Martini model developed by Marrink et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In the Martini model framework, a specific molecule can be constructed relatively easily by using the different particle types and interactions described in the model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The model was used to determine the CMC value of H<sub>1</sub>T<sub>4</sub> and tetra(ethylene) glycol monoalkyl ether (C<sub>8</sub>E<sub>4</sub>) and was found to overpredict the experimental values by a factor of 5 and 4 respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, the model was able to capture the aggregate size distribution and average aggregate size for H<sub>1</sub>T<sub>4</sub> and C<sub>8</sub>E<sub>4</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], as well as complex morphological changes of the oleic acid aggregates based on the protonation state of the oleic acid head groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and complex phase behavior of oleic acid including the pKa shift from 4.8 in water to 6.5 in small micelle and 6.6 in bilayer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">The aim of this study was to investigate CMC and aggregation behavior of four MCFAs (C<sub>8</sub>, C<sub>10</sub>, C<sub>12</sub>, and C<sub>14</sub>) as a function of protonation state of those respective MCFAs and the ionic strength of the buffer using CG-MD simulations with the Martini model. To verify how closely the CG-MD reproduced the experimental CMC values, we also measured the CMCs of C<sub>8</sub>, C<sub>10</sub>, and C<sub>12</sub> experimentally at different representative system conditions by mimicking our simulation conditions as closely as possible. The aggregation behavior obtained from the simulation was also compared with different experimental observations available in the literature.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>CG Model and Simulation</title><p id="Par6">The simulations of MCFA aggregates were run using the CG Martini v2.0 model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In this model, typically two to four heavy atoms are represented by one CG bead. To model C<sub>14</sub> (which has 14 carbon chain with a carboxyl headgroup), we used the available MCFA topology from the cgmartini.nl website, with three C1 beads used to represent the carbon chain and one bead (P4 or Qa) was used to represent the carboxylic head group, either as neutral or with a negative charge. The model of C<sub>10</sub> was obtained from C<sub>14</sub> by excluding one CG bead from the carbon chain, since one CG bead typically represented four heavy atoms. Therefore, the CG model of C<sub>10</sub> included three beads with P4/Qa for the headgroup and two beads for representing the carbon chain. The four-to-one mapping of heavy atoms into beads is both a strength and a weakness of the Martini model. One consequence is that it is not possible to separate, <italic>e.g.</italic>, fatty acids with similarly long carbon chains from each other. In this context, we, however, sought to investigate whether it was possible to circumvent and obtain relevant CMC values. To model C<sub>12</sub> which has 12 carbon chains with a carboxyl headgroup, we used four CG beads similar to C<sub>14</sub>. However, to represent the reduced chain length of C<sub>12</sub> compared to C<sub>14</sub>, the effective inter-particle distance of the beads was reduced from 0.47 to 0.37&#x000a0;nm, and a similar change was made going from C<sub>10</sub> to C<sub>8</sub>. No other changes were made to the force field.

Non-bonded interactions were set according to the recommendations for the Martini force fields and Gromacs 2016.4 version.

To represent the concentration of 1&#x000a0;mM of MCFA in the simulation box, 13 fatty acid molecules were needed. Approximately 192,000 water beads were used to fill up the box with water. When MCFA were used in the deprotonated state, an equal amount of positively charged sodium ions were also included to make the system neutral. To represent an ionic strength of 140&#x000a0;mM NaCl, 1820 Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> ions were added in the simulation box. For a number of simulations with C<sub>12</sub> and C<sub>14</sub>, a larger box of 44&#x000a0;nm<sup>3</sup> was used, because the aggregation occurs at much lower concentrations and the larger box size was required for reliable calculation of the number of free and aggregated molecules. To determine the CMC of a particular system, a number of simulations with increasing number of MCFA molecules were performed initiated from random dispersion of molecules in the box. Prior to the production run, energy minimization was performed for 10,000 steps using the steepest descent algorithm for each system followed by four short equilibration runs (50,000 steps) with time steps of 1, 2, 5, and 20&#x000a0;fs, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>MCFA Aggregates Determination</title><p id="Par8">To determine the MCFA aggregates, two MCFA molecules were considered to be in the same aggregate if their constituent beads were within a specific distance from each other.

A theoretical model was derived from the free energy density of a system containing free monomers, micelles, and counterions to calculate CMC; however, this approach was also shown to underestimate CMC values of various surfactants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. CMC has also been predicted from its relationship with Gibbs free energy and temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Using this method, CMC values for nonionic surfactants were closer to the measured values, but for zwitterionic surfactants, CMCs were again significantly underestimated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">In this work, we used a more direct approach based on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], using CG-MD simulations and a free fraction of molecules of 50% as the CMC value. This method resulted in CMC values consistent with previously reported results such as the observed decrease in CMC values with increasing carbon chain length has been observed in a number of experimental measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The decrease in CMC values with increasing ionic strength has also been experimentally determined for various surfactants, including C<sub>12</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], SDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], DDAO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], and including bile salts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. We observed that the protonation state of the MCFA concentrations affects CMC values. At the same ionic strength, when the system changed from 100% molecules with deprotonated carboxylic head groups to a 1:1 ratio of deprotonated to protonated carboxylic head groups, CMC values decreased 56% for C<sub>8</sub>, 44% for C<sub>10</sub>, 14% for C<sub>12</sub>, and 11% for C<sub>14</sub>. The systems with all molecules with neutral and deprotonated head groups mimic low and high pH, while the systems with 1:1 charged and non-charged head groups mimics the pH equal to the pKa of the molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The effect of pH has previously been experimentally investigated for SDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and decanoic acid/decanoate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], where it was found that CMC increased with increasing pH, which correlates well with our simulated values in different system conditions mimicking different pH levels. MCFAs also form bilayers or vesicles in the presence of uncharged molecules above the critical concentration for vesicle formation (CVC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. A number of studies have investigated the transition between vesicles and micelles at various system pH values and ratios of deprotonated and neutral molecules, and have found that MCFAs form bilayers at low and moderate pH values and micelles at high pH values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. We noticed similar pH-dependent morphologies of the aggregates for C<sub>8</sub> (bilayers at low/intermediate pH, micelles at high pH; snapshots in Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>).</p><p id="Par20">In addition to the simulations described above, we also measured CMC of C<sub>8</sub>, C<sub>10</sub>, and C<sub>12</sub> at two different system conditions (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">I</xref>, section 3) using the Wilhelmy method. The measured CMC values also showed decrease with increasing chain length of the MCFA molecules and decreasing pH of the system. Our simulations underestimated the experimentally measured CMCs by a factor of 1.8 to 3.5. This discrepancy was probably due to limitations of the CG force field used in this study, which is not capable of truly representing a specific pH condition of the buffer solution (water in this case). Note that the CMC is highly dependent on the buffer solution of the system. Different experimental methods used to measure the CMC also provided large variation in results mainly due to the variation of the measurement methods and the use of different buffer solutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">The key finding of this study was to demonstrate the viability of the CG-MD simulation technique in determining aggregation and CMCs of MCFAs at different system conditions. The close correlation between the simulation results and experimental data suggests that the CG-MD technique may be a suitable candidate for studying fatty acids as formulation candidates and permeability enhancers for the delivery of oral macromolecular drugs. This technique captured the small size difference among the various MCFAs by the very simple change of introducing a reduced CG bead-bead distance. This modification of the CG Martini model seems to provide results consistent with the experimental values, but this approach requires careful validation for other systems and research questions. The major advantage of the CG-MD technique is that it requires fewer computational resources than the AA-MD simulations. Therefore, relatively large systems can be simulated over longer time scales. Our simulations needed around a microsecond to reach equilibrium so that the number of molecules in the free and aggregated forms were stable. We also needed a larger than usual box size (44&#x000a0;nm<sup>3</sup>) for the simulations of C<sub>12</sub> and C<sub>14</sub> in order to maintain an adequate number of MCFA molecules so that aggregation could occur. We performed a few simulations by varying the box sizes but with the same ratio of MCFA molecules and box size to determine the fraction of free molecules in each case. We were able to verify that five times more molecules than the cutoff value of the aggregate size is sufficient to obtain reliable fraction of free molecules.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p id="Par22">In this study, we investigated the aggregation behavior of four MCFAs commonly used as transient permeability enhancers for oral delivery of macromolecules. Our CMC measurements from CG-MD simulations were 1.8- to 3.5-fold lower than the experimentally measured values. The aggregate size, numbers, and morphologies as a function of carbon chain length, MCFA concentration, and ratio of deprotonated and non-charged MCFA molecules was consistent with experimental data. The calculated CMC values also ranked the compounds similarly as the experimental values. However, in order to reproduce the experimental CMC values more closely, improved force field parameterization to better represent the exact pH value of the buffer system might be needed. Among the current available models, polarizable water model can be used to better represent the electrostatics of the system. Finally, this study suggests that the CG-MD Martini model is promising for evaluating MCFAs as formulation candidates and transient permeability enhancers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec10"><p>

No ambient temperature differences were recorded on days with pavement burn admissions compared to days without these admissions. There were 225 pavement, 27 MVC, 15 road rash, and 103 other contact burns. The major injuries in the pavement group were due to being &#x0201c;down&#x0201d; (unknown reason), falls, and barefoot.

Temperatures severe enough to contribute to burns from the environment have been reported, especially in heavily populated desert areas. The first accounts of pavement-street contact burns were the Arizona Burn Center case series of three motor vehicle crashes (MVCs) by Berens&#x000a0;in 1970 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and the temperature and patient description in 1995 by Harrington et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Additional contact pavement burn reports from this center were on pediatric feet&#x000a0;in 2006 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and seizures in&#x000a0;2007 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The aim of this study was to investigate the demographic characteristics of the recent significant increase in the number of pavement-street burns from 2016 to 2018 compared to those previously published in 1995 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], which had reported 23 cases in a 6-year-period (1986-1992), and other studies in the literature. The hypothesis was that the increased number of pavement-street burns was due to higher ambient and naturally heated surface temperatures. In addition, we proposed that contact burns sustained in MVCs/road rash were significantly less severe than those which resulted from body contact with hot pavements-streets.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Sample population</title><p id="Par29">This was a three-year retrospective burn center in-house registry study at the Arizona Burn Center. The study population consisted of patients who had contact burns as an initial admission mainly in the summer with late spring and early autumn months (May-September) of a three year (2016 to 2018) period. These burns were sorted into: pavement/street/highway/asphalt/bench: pavement group (n=225); status post MVC: MVC group (n=27); road rash: road rash group (n=15), and scald/hot object, etc.: other contact group (n=103). The database consisted of de-identified patients. This study was approved by the Maricopa Integrated Health System Institutional Review Board in Phoenix, Arizona.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Previous temperature data</title><p id="Par30">In 1947, studies by Moritz and Henriques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] noted that second degree burns resulted when the contact surface temperature was 44<sup>o</sup>C (111<sup>o</sup>F) for 6 hours, 50<sup>o</sup>C (122<sup>o</sup>F) for 15 minutes, 60<sup>o</sup>C (140<sup>o</sup>F) for 5 seconds, and 65<sup>o</sup>C (149<sup>o</sup>F) for 2 seconds. In comparison, the American Burn Association [8] stated that hot tap water and scalds can cause third degree burns in 5 seconds at 60<sup>o</sup>C (140<sup>o</sup>F), and 1 second at 68<sup>o</sup>C (155<sup>o</sup>F). In Adelaide, Australia, Clifton et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] documented similar natural surface temperatures for shaded and unshaded slate, metal, cement, sand, brick and bitumen. Rumney&#x000a0;et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and Way [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] measured asphalt temperatures in different state locations in the 1970&#x02019;s and 1980&#x02019;s and found that the peak daily temperatures occurred around 3 pm. The hottest temperatures were in June and July with a mean daily asphalt temperature of 68<sup>o</sup>C (154.4<sup>o</sup>F) and a maximum daily asphalt temperature peak of 71.1<sup>o</sup>C (160<sup>o</sup>F) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In relation to climate change, it has been recorded that the state has warmed about 2<sup>o</sup>F in the last century [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Comparing the average annual number of days with maximum temperatures of 110<sup>o</sup>F or higher from 1981-2010 to 1896-2010, it was 19&#x000a0;days vs 11 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par1231">Harrington et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] recorded their own temperatures on concrete, asphalt, steel, lawn, dirt and sand. They noted that ambient temperatures of 35<sup>o</sup>C to 37.8<sup>o</sup>C (95<sup>o</sup>F to 100<sup>o</sup>F) were necessary to produce a surface temperature of 44<sup>o</sup>C (111<sup>o</sup>F) to cause a cutaneous burn injury. In their study, asphalt and sand peaked at approximately 68<sup>o</sup>C (154<sup>o</sup>F), and dirt, cement and steel peaked at 58-60<sup>o</sup>C (136-140<sup>o</sup>F). Shade decreased the surface temperature on asphalt and cement peaks to 43<sup>o</sup>C (109<sup>o</sup>F) and 39<sup>o</sup>C (102<sup>o</sup>F) respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].

The median 2<sup>o</sup>F increase in ambient temperature between the &#x0201c;Streets of Fire&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] article and the current study may be reflective of the climate change records, which indicate that the state has warmed up by 2<sup>o</sup>F in the last century [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In the 1995 study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], median ambient temperatures were 106<sup>o</sup>F (range 100-113<sup>o</sup>F) compared to 108<sup>o</sup>F (range 86-119<sup>o</sup>F) highest noon temperature in the current study. In Phoenix, the maximum daily ambient temperature on the day of injury admissions was not increased compared to days when there were no pavement-street burn admissions. This center experienced more of these admissions in the target months of summer, with late spring and early autumn (May to September) during almost constant daily high temperatures above 95-100<sup>o</sup>F compared with January to April and October to December during the three year period. The present study does not reflect the most recent pavement burn report of exponential increase in burn pavement admissions with increasing temperatures seen in Las Vegas, Nevada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Contact burns sustained in motor vehicle crashes were significantly less severe than those from body contact with hot pavements-streets as evidenced in the statistically significant increased mortality in the pavement group compared to the MVC group (6% vs 4% respectively). However, the pavement and MVC groups were similar in median levels of LOS, GCS, BMI, and ethanol use.</p><p id="Par52">From a population of 1.135 million in 1995, the current 2017 estimate is 1,626 million, which makes Phoenix the 5<sup>th</sup> largest city in the United States, replacing Philadelphia, PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. As of 2018, the major Phoenix ethnicity was Caucasian (44%), followed by the Hispanic contingent of 41%, African American 7%, Asian 4%, and other 4% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In comparison, the pavement group had only 17% Hispanic patients with burn injuries. The present study did not determine why there was such a difference between the Hispanic population and the Hispanic pavement-street contact injuries. One possible reason is that the burn center serves a Phoenix metropolitan population of more than 4 million individuals, Arizona and neighboring states, not all of which have a high Hispanic population. Since 1995, as the population and technological innovations increased, there was an expansion of burn center services, advertisements, public awareness through research with community education, and extended outreach to the adjacent state communities. The population growth may also have contributed to the increase in pavement-street contact burns.</p><p id="Par53">Two Phoenix populations have been previously reported as pavement burn injuries: pediatric patients with foot burns and seizure patients. The 2006 study by Sinha et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] reported that 34 of 182 children had burnt feet treated between May 2000 and August 2005. Of these, only one required hospitalization and grafting; all the others were treated as outpatients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In August 2005, the Arizona State Department of Health Services instituted mandatory sun safety education in schools and required that the <italic>SunWise</italic> program sponsored by the United States Environmental Protection Agency be taught in all public elementary schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This prevention program may have been effective in the pediatric population since we saw so few children in this study.</p><p id="Par54">In 2007, Rimmer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] reported a similar number of seizure patients to that seen in the current study group. In a period of 5 years, there were 32 patients with seizures admitted of whom 10 were burnt falling on hot pavements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The report noted that the seizure patients had a mean&#x000b1;standard deviation (SD) of 3.8&#x000b1;2 %TBSA compared to this study group of seizure patients who had a mean&#x000b1;SD of 4.6&#x000b1;3 %TBSA; their average length of stay was 6.8 days compared to the median of 14 days for the present study seizure patients. There was no age stated for the reported seizure patients for comparison.</p><p id="Par55">An additional locale where there have been pavement-street burns has been Las Vegas, Nevada. The findings in their seven patients have been included with the other group articles in the literature review (Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Hospital charges are an important consideration and were assessed in a Las Vegas study comparing patients with pavement burns with/without altered mental status (AMS) from May 2008 to September 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The patients had a median 6.7 %TBSA size burn with a median hospital charge of US$ 13,276/%TBSA and a median LOS of 12 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In comparison, although the current study pavement group had a median of 4% TBSA, an LOS of 12 days, and a median hospital charge for the hospitalization of US$172,024, the hospital charges/%TBSA were US$43,006 and hospital charges/LOS were US$14,335. The different charges between the two institutions may be a result of multiple factors that were not known for this comparison, such as age, co-morbidities, complications, the frequency of third degree burns, etc. Recently, Vega et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] reported on 173 pavement-related burn injuries (2013-2017). More than 88 % of these injuries occurred when the ambient temperature was &#x02265; 95<sup>o</sup>F [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. They also noted that as the ambient temperature increased, pavement burn injury admission increased exponentially [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par56">Currently, there is much interest in assessing why some cities are hotter than others. One assessment method is the use of the urban heat island (UHI) index for determining how hot a city might be to live in. Debbage and Shepherd [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] from the University of Georgia investigated the 50 most densely populated cities in the United States and determined that the UHI intensity in Phoenix was 0.52&#x02103; to 0.91 <sup>o</sup>C compared to Las Vegas, which had a lower UHI intensity of -1.37&#x02103; to - 0.44<sup>o</sup>C. One of the reasons that Las Vegas has a lower UHI intensity is that the city consists of approximately 7.5% barren land compared to Phoenix, which is more densely populated with buildings and thoroughfares and has less than 1% empty land [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In addition, Las Vegas is positioned at a higher above sea elevation (2,011 feet) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] compared to Phoenix at (1, 200 feet.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The higher the elevation, the cooler the ambient temperature gradient.</p><p id="Par57">Climatologists and city engineers found that adjacent densely populated and sprawling city development both contribute to the UHI intensity, and that non-contiguous urban development separated by green spaces may lower the UHI intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Another study recommended that city planners include more vegetation adjoining new construction and development to decrease the UHI intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Since the &#x0201c;Streets of Fire&#x0201d; in 1995 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], Phoenix has expanded in size with an increased population density, and increased concrete, asphalt and other surfaces absorbing and retaining radiant energy during the day, before the cooling off in the evening, when the surface heat is dissipated into the atmosphere. Another variable which contributes to population density and expansion of resource needs is the human element.</p><p id="Par58">There were 225 pavement group cases, the majority of which were due to being &#x0201c;down&#x0201d; (time spent on the ground before getting rescued), falls (not being able to get up), and bare feet. Compared to the other groups, the pavement group was: older, 120 (53%) patients were 56+ years old, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c;0.0002, and had smaller %TBSA but similar lengths of stay. There were 13 (6.0%) fatalities in the pavement group vs one (4.0%) in the MVC group. Co-morbidities were a major contribution to the mortalities in the pavement group elder population. They were the largest component of the down and fall subset. In this contingent, it was frequently unknown how long the patients were exposed to the hot pavement, how many were dehydrated, or suffered heat stroke, seizures, or syncope at the time of their injury. Of the fatalities, the major co-morbidities in the present study&#x000a0;were acute renal and pulmonary failure and heart disease. The combination of hypertension treated with diuretics during the hot summer months may have contributed to the renal disease and mortality. A recent article indicated a negative impact of high ambient temperatures on kidney function in patient &#x0003e;75 years old medicated on common hypertensive drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par59">Nationally, there were approximately 35 million individuals 65+ years old in the United States in 2000, and that number increased to 46.2 million in 2014 because of the &#x0201c;baby boomer&#x0201d; generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. It is projected to increase to 98.2 million in 2060 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In 2015, Maricopa County had an estimated four million residents, of whom nearly 25% were 55+ years old [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].The biggest contingent was that of the 60+ years old seniors at 767,477 individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In this study, the patients most at risk for falls and pavement burns were patients 56+ years old.</p><p id="Par60">It has to be noted that these aged individuals will continue to settle and populate this area because of the climate, thereby escalating the prospect of continued increases in pavement-street contact burns. Utilizing the wisdom from the past, a <italic>SunWise</italic> program for seniors through the State Department of Human Services can be developed and promoted on TV, libraries, shopping malls, and senior centers for public health education to reduce the &#x0201c;down, fall, and barefoot &#x0201c; pavement-street contact burn injuries.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par61">This was a small three-year study of the burn center registry information which is provided to the National Burn Repository of the American Burn Association. As a retrospective review, bias may have been introduced due to the medical information obtained from hospital records and coder interpretation of the medical charts. The temperature readings of the heated surface areas were only three weeks in August; the hottest surface temperatures in June and July were not available for comparison. There were also few MVC and road rash cases for comparison</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par62">Pavement burns have increased since the 1995 publication of the &#x0201c;Streets of Fire&#x0201d;. The majority were due to &#x0201c;down time spent on the ground before getting rescued,&#x0201d; falls, and barefoot excursions. The ambient and surface temperatures have not increased significantly since 1995, but reflected the median 2<sup>o</sup>F increase in ambient temperature that has contributed to state warming in this century. The majority of patients in these groups have been older adults, 56+ years old. With a higher death rate among the patients, pavement burns were significantly more severe than MVC contact burns. Because of baby boomers, it is projected that the senior population will be increasing in the future. Cities with high potential for pavement-street contact burns in the summer need to be prepared for the attendant health services and education this population will require. In addition, future city and desert area expansion may benefit from proliferation of green spaces throughout the city and outlying areas to decrease the UHI effect. Future comparison studies of ambient and surface temperatures in select city developments with/without green spaces may be warranted.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AA</term><def><p id="Par5">African American</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ANOVA</term><def><p id="Par6">Analysis of variance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p id="Par7">Body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>F</term><def><p id="Par8">Female</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GCS</term><def><p id="Par9">Glasgow Coma Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICU</term><def><p id="Par10">Intensive care unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IRB</term><def><p id="Par11">Institutional Review Board</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ISS</term><def><p id="Par12">Injury Severity Score</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LCD</term><def><p id="Par13">Liquid crystal display</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LOS</term><def><p id="Par14">Length of stay</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>M</term><def><p id="Par15">Male</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MVC</term><def><p id="Par17">Motor vehicle crash</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OR</term><def><p id="Par18">Operating room</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>%TBSA</term><def><p id="Par20">Percent of&#x000a0;Total body surface area</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UHI</term><def><p id="Par21">Urban Heat Island Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Vent</term><def><p id="Par23">Ventilator</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>None</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>AKV and KF contributed to the research, intellectual analysis, writing, and editing to this manuscript.

Only 29% felt very confident managing treatment-related side effects compared with 46% and 65% for psychological symptoms and lifestyle advice respectively. Half reported usually receiving cancer treatment summaries and survivorship care plans but most of the sample felt these would improve their ability to provide care (76%). Only 53% were convinced of the usefulness of cancer care reviews. Although most felt that primary and specialist care should share responsibility for managing bone (81%) and cardiovascular (77%) health consequences, fewer than half reported often taking previous history of cancer or cancer treatment into consideration when assessing bone health; only one-fifth did this in relation to cardiovascular health.

More than 80% of children and adolescents, and 50% of adults diagnosed with cancer, will survive for &#x02265;5 years after completing their cancer treatment.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> There are currently &#x0003e;14.5 million US and 2 million UK survivors of cancer, equating to about 3% of each population; over the next decade these numbers are expected to grow to 19 million and 3 million respectively.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Traditionally, follow-up care has been provided by cancer specialists and has mainly focused on monitoring for recurrence and second primary cancers. With the number of survivors of cancer growing dramatically, a model of care led purely by secondary care is clearly no longer feasible;<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> a more holistic approach is also needed. Integrated models of care are warranted, as when care is shared between secondary and primary care, or in models in which primary care takes over the care of patients who are stable earlier than currently happens. The National Cancer Survivorship Initiative (NCSI) has proposed a risk-stratified approach, whereby those at low risk are supported to self-manage in the community, those at high risk are managed by specialist teams, and care for those at moderate risk is shared by secondary and primary care.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Many survivors of cancer are at risk of chronic morbidity and premature mortality as a consequence of their cancer and its treatment.<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Some of these consequences present during, or soon after, active treatment and can persist for many years. They include:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>chronic fatigue;</p></list-item><list-item><p>persistent pain;</p></list-item><list-item><p>mental health problems;</p></list-item><list-item><p>sexual dysfunction; and</p></list-item><list-item><p>urinary and gastrointestinal problems.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p></list-item></list></p><p>Others are considered to be &#x02018;late effects&#x02019;, due to the cancer and its treatment. These may include bone, pulmonary, renal, or neurological toxicities, and there is also increasing evidence that cardiovascular health can be affected by many types of cancer treatment. As an example, following childhood cancer treatment, people are five times more likely to develop congestive heart failure and myocardial infarction compared with their siblings.<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>As many as 500 000 UK survivors of cancer are considered to be experiencing consequences attributable to cancer treatment,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> yet there is evidence that many, particularly adult survivors of childhood cancer, do not receive appropriate generalist or specialist care that focuses on the risks arising from their prior cancer therapy.<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><boxed-text position="float"><sec><title>How this fits in</title><p>As many as 500 000 survivors of cancer in the UK are considered to be experiencing consequences attributable to cancer and its treatment. Despite recent recommendations, only half the surveyed GPs in England reported usually receiving cancer treatment summaries and survivorship care plans, and fewer took a previous history of cancer or cancer treatment into consideration when assessing bone or cardiovascular health. The findings suggest that interventions should focus on improving communication between specialist and primary care, raising GP awareness of physical and psychological consequences, and enhancing GP knowledge of late effects of cancer treatment.</p></sec></boxed-text><p>Over the last decade an international focus on cancer follow-up has begun to recognise these unmet needs of survivors of cancer.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Experts have advocated the value of sharing survivorship care between specialists and primary care, and there is increasing evidence that, as well as preventive care, such as advice around physical activity and healthy weight management,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> follow-up care for some cancers can be provided as safely and effectively in primary as in secondary care.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In the UK, primary care is potentially well placed to undertake this work, with its universal system of patient registration, generalist skills, and high satisfaction ratings.</p><p>The 2012 UK NCSI promoted a &#x02018;recovery package&#x02019; that included a cancer treatment summary for patients and their GPs. It detailed possible treatment toxicities, late effects, and alert symptoms requiring referral back to specialist care, along with an ongoing management plan.<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> It also recommended a survivorship care plan, a structured holistic needs assessment aiming to help assessment and monitoring, and a cancer care review to be undertaken by a GP within 6 months of their patient&#x02019;s cancer diagnosis. This should be encouraged through inclusion in the general medical services Quality and Outcomes Framework.<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>Against this background of recent recommendations, the aim of this study was to examine the current practices and views of GPs in England on providing care for those living with, and beyond, cancer. The researchers were interested in GPs&#x02019; experiences, knowledge, and views in relation not only to caring for people who have recently completed active cancer treatment, but also to caring for people living beyond cancer treatment in general, and in relation to cardiovascular and bone health after cancer specifically.</p></sec><sec><title>METHOD</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>A questionnaire was distributed electronically via Medix, a leading market research consultancy specialising in high-quality online research using pre-recruited panels of medical professionals. At the time of recruitment, the UK GP panel size was approximately 10 000. Sampling was restricted to currently practising GPs, was stratified by NHS region, and was conducted on a &#x02018;first come, first served&#x02019; basis; the target number of responses was 500.</p><p>Recruitment started in mid-June 2014 and continued for 4 weeks, when the target number of responses was reached. Potential participants were sent an e-mail explaining the purpose of the study and a web link to the survey; entry into a prize draw for taking part was also offered.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Survey instrument</title><p>The survey (available from the authors on request) was adapted from prior surveys assessing physician knowledge and attitudes regarding care of patients with cancer,<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and also included new questions generated specifically for this study and informed by expert opinion. It comprised 25 questions focused on follow-up care for survivors of cancer, who were defined as &#x02018;people living with, and beyond, cancer (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) or those who have completed definitive primary cancer treatment&#x02019;.<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Quantitative survey items utilised &#x02018;yes/no&#x02019; responses and five-point Likert scales. The questionnaire was piloted with non-academic GP colleagues (<italic>n</italic> = 6) to ensure face validity. No questions were removed or added in this process but the wording of some items was slightly modified in response to their feedback. For example, &#x02018;further training&#x02019; was changed to &#x02018;further learning opportunity&#x02019; and the word &#x02018;diminished&#x02019; when referring to &#x02018;diminished cardiovascular or bone health&#x02019; was amended to &#x02018;reduced&#x02019;.</p><p>The survey sought information about GP demographics, experience, workload, and practice type Responders were asked:

They were less confident giving advice concerning work and finances, and provided this information less frequently.</p><p>The GPs felt that more information and communication in the form of cancer treatment summaries and survivorship care plans would improve their ability to provide quality cancer care. Although most were providing cancer care reviews, more than half of these are undertaken opportunistically or via telephone consultations and without using templates, and just over one-third of GPs were uncertain about their usefulness.</p><p>Most felt that primary and specialist care could jointly manage bone and cardiovascular health consequences. However, many reported being unaware of a previous diagnosis of cancer and did not routinely consider a previous history of cancer when assessing bone or cardiovascular health. Encouragingly, most GPs had an appetite for further education to improve their knowledge and expertise about the management of cancer treatment-related side effects and cardiovascular and bone consequences.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Using an established research company enabled the views of GPs across each NHS region in England to be sampled, and a large sample of 500 responders was achieved. However, these participants are drawn from a group of GPs interested in taking part in research and, as such, may not be entirely representative of GPs in England. The sample also included more male GPs, GP partners, and trainers, and fewer full-time GPs, than the national average. The findings should, therefore, be generalised to national level with some caution. Furthermore, the survey may be susceptible to response bias; for example, it could be that better-educated GPs or those with a greater interest in the care of survivors of cancer were more likely to respond. In addition, the findings on current practice are self-reported and may differ from actual behaviour.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with existing literature</title><p>Despite the efforts of the recent NCSI strategies, the findings presented here are not substantially improved from those reported following a similar, but smaller, online survey of GPs in England (<italic>n</italic> = 200) conducted in 2009;<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> there was no improvement in the proportion conducting a cancer care review opportunistically rather than routinely.</p><p>There was also little improvement in the communication from expert care, particularly at the completion of active cancer treatment, and similar findings have been found in North American surveys of primary care physicians.<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> This is despite evidence that interventions improving communication between primary and secondary care have been shown to increase GP involvement in cancer care.<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>Most responders reported a willingness to accept either shared or sole responsibility for the routine follow-up care of their patients; primary care physicians in North America<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and GPs in the Netherlands<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> have demonstrated similar attitudes. Some studies have only identified this willingness when the GPs were provided with a survivorship care plan, or in consultation with a long-term specialist follow-up programme.<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> However, most studies in this area have focused on caring for people as they complete treatment for breast or colorectal cancer. It may be that GP willingness depends on the specific type of cancer, its complexity, and the type of the follow-up tests required; for instance, GPs may have more concerns about caring for survivors of childhood cancer.<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> A number of studies have also reported disagreement between GPs and oncologists regarding the ideal model of follow-up care, with some oncologists not favouring increased GP involvement<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> and some GPs preferring main responsibility to remain with oncologists.<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> These attitudinal barriers could impede implementation of new models of shared care, but may be more prevalent in healthcare systems such as that in the US.<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p><p>The willingness of GPs to work more closely with secondary care on the follow-up role may also be hampered by a perceived lack of specialist knowledge.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In contrast with the earlier English survey,<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> this study found an enthusiasm for further training, particularly around the impact of late effects of cancer treatment on bone and cardiovascular health. This may be due to the recent influence of the NCSI in the UK &#x02014; this contrasts with reports from North America where, although primary care physicians desire to be closely involved in delivering survivorship care, many felt unprepared to both evaluate and manage the long-term effects of their survivors of cancer.<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>The resonance of the study findings with results from similar surveys undertaken in North America and Western Europe also suggests that the issues around caring for people living with, and beyond, cancer are universal. Against the backdrop of increasing and ageing populations, along with improved cancer detection and treatment, patients are living with their disease for longer. A recent editorial in <italic>Lancet Oncology</italic> suggested that &#x02018;provision for cancer patients [is] a priority in primary care reforms&#x02019;,<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> and highlighted the need for more patient-centred and integrated primary and secondary care. This is supported by the results of this study, in which almost all GPs (97%) agreed that primary care should play a role in the care of patients living beyond cancer, and many felt increased communication between primary and secondary care would improve their ability to provide quality cancer care.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Implications for practice</title><p>Better dissemination of currently available survivorship care resources would encourage their systematic application.<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Timely use of cancer treatment summaries would enhance communication between specialist and generalist care, and appropriate development of survivorship care plans would enhance a patient-centred approach. Optimising the utility of current cancer care reviews by encouraging the development of local templates and planned appointments may also enable GPs to feel more confident about their role, and would usefully provide an opportunity for patients to discuss their future care with their GP. This could be achieved by encouraging GP practices to adopt a proactive, rather than reactive, approach to cancer care reviews, through the development of local templates; this appeared to be favoured by GPs as well as by specialists encouraging patients to make an appointment to see their GP at the point of discharge after completion of treatment.<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p><p>It may also be useful for GPs to make contact with a patient at the time of diagnosis as acknowledgement of the diagnosis and to offer general support, thereby promoting an integrated approach to care.<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Integrated care, with seamless transitions between care providers, could also be facilitated by patient-held or electronic resources; there is some recent evidence for the usefulness of web-based survivorship care plans for adult survivors of childhood cancer.<xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Although these approaches are all highly desirable, they bring with them resource implications for primary care. In the current context of English primary care struggling to meet current demand, and training places not being filled, the British Medical Association has recently recommended that practices should receive resources to provide extra services.<xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></p><p>Although most cancer survivorship work has focused on people living with, and beyond, the most common adult cancers &#x02014; namely breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer &#x02014; with reasonable outcomes, survivors of childhood cancer are an important group for the number of life years gained. Most will seek care from primary care, which will need appropriate guidelines and tools to support that. Shared-care models have been piloted in the Netherlands;<xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> similar models may have value in other countries. GPs in remote areas may need more specific guidelines and tools to support shared care.</p><p>Late effects of cancer treatment on cardiovascular health are also becoming a priority area as more radiotherapy and combination, adjuvant, and targeted chemotherapies are delivered. Rapid improvements in outcomes from childhood cancer treatment have led to many more adult survivors at increased cardiovascular risk, as well as older adult survivors including those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. This study showed that, although GPs often did not consider a previous diagnosis of cancer when discussing cardiovascular and bone health, most had an appetite for further education to improve their expertise in the management of cancer treatment-related side effects and cardiovascular and bone consequences.</p><p>In conclusion, GPs need efficient tools and appropriate education to provide high-quality care for people living with the consequences of cancer and its treatment. Interventions should focus on improving communication between primary and secondary care, raising awareness of physical and psychological consequences, optimising existing resources, and enhancing knowledge of late effects and how best to manage them.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Lesley Smith, manager of the Consequences of Treatment Programme at Macmillan Cancer Action for her enthusiastic support and contribution to the development of the questionnaire.</p></ack><notes><sec><title>Funding</title><p>The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) is funding Juliet Usher-Smith as an NIHR clinical lecturer and Fiona M Walter as an NIHR clinician scientist.

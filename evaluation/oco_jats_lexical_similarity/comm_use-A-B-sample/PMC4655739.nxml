Only a few of the male patients on a GP&#x02019;s list develop prostate cancer over a year, but finding them is a challenge for GPs and a fear of overlooking cancer in general seems to be all-pervading.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Risk tolerance has been shown to have an impact on physician activities, for example: longer cardiopulmonary resuscitations in a fictional case,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> more use of laboratory services,<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and higher admission rate to an intensive care unit.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Because the operationalisation of risk attitude in the cited studies has been criticised for assessing &#x02018;sure-loss-avoidance&#x02019; rather than risk tolerance, it seems relevant to examine the effect of risk attitude approached as a multidimensional construct on physician activities.</p><p>It has been shown that a GP&#x02019;s perception of a patient&#x02019;s need for reassurance is a determinant for test ordering in general practice.<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> As GPs differ in their capacity to recognise emotions that are being experienced by a patient, it would be relevant to examine whether there is an association between physician empathy and test ordering.</p><p>Burnout seems to be increasing among GPs.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The consequences of burnout for patient safety are controversial because burnout has been associated with an increased number of self-reported errors among primary care physicians,<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> as well as with longer consultations and more focus on problems of a psychosocial nature in the consultations.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>In this study it was hypothesised that low levels of risk tolerance are associated with high rates of PSA test ordering, high levels of empathy are associated with high rates of PSA test ordering, and burnout is also associated with rates of PSA test ordering (two-sided hypothesis).</p><p>The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether GPs&#x02019; PSA test ordering was related to levels of risk attitude, which include tolerance of uncertainty and ambiguity, and also empathy, and burnout.</p></sec><sec><title>METHOD</title><sec><title>Setting</title><p>GPs in Denmark are independent contractors with the regional health authorities. The patient list size is on average 1550 patients per GP including children. All Danish citizens are assigned a unique personal identification number, the civil registration number (CRN), from which information from numerous nationwide registers in Denmark can be linked.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods|subjects"><title>Study population: GPs and patients</title><p>In January 2012, all 835 active GPs in the Central Denmark Region (Denmark is organised into five regions and includes several towns; the Central Denmark Region is one of them) were invited to participate in a survey on job satisfaction (&#x02018;the GP profile&#x02019;). GPs were identified by the Regional Registry of Health Providers. Non-responders were sent a reminder after 4 and 13 weeks, and GPs were remunerated to the amount of &#x020ac;50 for responding. For the purpose of this study, only solo GPs (physicians working in single-handed practice) who were active throughout the entire study period (2012) were included.</p><boxed-text position="float"><sec><title>How this fits in</title><p>Rates of PSA test ordering vary considerably among GPs. Aspects of GPs&#x02019; risk-taking were found to be associated with patients&#x02019; probability of having an incident and a repeated normal PSA test, but burnout and empathy were not found to be associated. Uncertainty and ambiguity characterising decision making in general practice may induce discomfort in the GP. GPs might benefit from increased focus on their personal characteristics to reduce stress and empower them to handle such situations.</p></sec></boxed-text><p>Study cases were male patients aged &#x02265;20 years who were registered, in the Patient List Register, with one of the included solo GPs throughout 2012. Patients registered with a positive prostate cancer diagnosis before 1 January 2012 were excluded. Information concerning prostate cancer diagnosis (code C619 according to the International Classification of Disease (ICD) version 10) was obtained from The Danish Cancer Register.<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Information concerning educational level and marital status for each patient was provided by the Integrated Database for Labour Market Research in Statistics Denmark. According to the International Standard Classification of Education, level of education was classified as low (&#x02264;10 years), middle (&#x0003e;10 and &#x02264;15 years), or high (&#x0003e;15 years). Marital status was categorised as cohabiting (married or living with a partner) or single (living alone).</p></sec><sec><title>PSA tests</title><p>All PSA tests performed from 1 January to 31 December 2012 in the Central Denmark Region were retrieved from the laboratory database (LABKA).<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Data contained patients&#x02019; CRN, test results, and identification data of the requesting healthcare provider (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> for exclusion of invalid tests). Data were also collected from LABKA concerning PSA tests from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011 for the purpose of characterising every PSA test ordered in 2012 as either &#x02018;an incident test,&#x02019; that is, the first PSA test within 24 months, &#x02018;a repeated normal test&#x02019;, that is, a test preceded by a test with a normal result (&#x02264;4.0 ng/ml) within the previous 24 months, and &#x02018;a repeated raised test&#x02019;, that is, a test preceded by a test with a raised result (&#x0003e;4.0 ng/ml) within the previous 24 months.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>The pool of PSA tests was merged with study cases by means of patients&#x02019; CRN.

All items were scored on a 6-point Likert scale, and all scales have been developed for use in medical practice.</p><p>The PRU scale<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> consists of four subscales: anxiety due to uncertainty (5 items); concern about bad outcomes (3 items); reluctance to disclose mistakes to physicians (2 items); and reluctance to disclose uncertainty to patients (5 items). Higher scores on each of the subscales reflect more psychological discomfort in dealing with uncertainty. The structure of the scale has been supported by the results of a confirmatory factor analysis.<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>The TFA scale<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> includes 7 items, and higher scores indicate more tolerance for ambiguity.

The MBI-HSS consists of 22 items scored on a 7-point Likert scale constituting three subscales: 1) emotional exhaustion (9 items); 2) depersonalisation (5 items); and 3) personal accomplishment (8 items). Each subscale score is categorised as low or high based on normative population score.<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> A high level of emotional exhaustion is defined as a score &#x0003e;26, and a high level of depersonalisation is defined as a score &#x0003e;9. Low personal accomplishment is defined as a score &#x0003c;34.

However, males registered with a GP with high tolerance for ambiguity were less likely to have an incident PSA test. Patients registered with a GP reporting high tolerance for ambiguity also were less likely to have a repeated normal PSA test, as were patients registered with a GP reporting propensity to risk-taking. As recommendations exist concerning the handling of elevated test results, it was found to be reassuring that risk attitudes were not affecting the likelihood of repeated raised PSA tests.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Among the strengths of the present prospective study are the use of a clinical database for registration of PSA test rates and the classification of PSA into incident tests, repeated normal tests, and repeated raised tests.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Furthermore, from the Danish CRN, it was possible to exclude male patients who had been diagnosed with prostate cancer and are monitored with regular PSA tests. A few methodological weaknesses also have to be mentioned. First, as a consequence of registration of the identity of test orderers in LABKA, only solo GPs could be included in the study. As solo GPs may be a selected group of GPs, biased results in either direction cannot be excluded. Likewise, assessment of risk attitudes, including tolerance of uncertainty and ambiguity, empathy, and burnout, may be influenced by response bias. Second, in the algorithm, a &#x02018;normal PSA test result&#x02019; was classified as &#x02264;4.0 ng/ml even though it has been recommended to use age-dependent limits. This may have influenced the categorisation of repeated normal and repeated raised tests, but not the categorisation of incident tests. Third, the scales used for assessment of risk attitude and empathy have all been developed for use in medical practice, but not specifically for use in general practice, and some of the clinical situations used for validation of the scales are far from clinical situations seen in general practice. Fourth, even though the results were adjusted for several patient characteristics, residual confounding cannot be excluded, for example, the influence of GP characteristics that were not considered, such as knowledge and adherence to guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with existing literature</title><p>The finding that GPs&#x02019; increased risk-taking propensity was one of the factors that reduced patients&#x02019; risk of having a repeated normal PSA test accords with results from two previous studies using the same risk-seeking assessment questionnaire. Thus, increased risk-taking propensity was found to be related to lower levels of patient charges used as a proxy for physicians&#x02019; resource use,<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and to lower admitting rates of emergency room physicians.<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>The results of one other study revealed an association between higher scores on intolerance of clinical uncertainty and higher scores on reliance on high-technology medicine in medical students and a preference for &#x02018;medicine by numbers.&#x02019;<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Applying this explanation to the present findings, GPs who were intolerant of ambiguity may perceive the PSA test as a way to quantify the risk of prostate cancer in worried patients.</p><p>It was found in the present study that patients registered with a GP concerned about bad outcomes were more likely to have an incident PSA test performed. The results of a study including only 20 physicians and using the same scale revealed a non-significant tendency that GPs who were highly concerned about bad outcomes had higher median patient charges than primary care physicians who were less concerned about bad outcomes.<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>No association was found between burnout and PSA testing. Even though burnout is believed to be a serious issue for the medical profession, evidence concerning the negative influences of burnout on patient safety is actually scarce. The influence of burnout on job performance may depend on the timing of the assessment. Thus, high ambition and perfectionism are risk factors for burnout, and, in the early stages of burnout, a GP&#x02019;s work may therefore be characterised by thoroughness. In later stages, carelessness and lack of concern for patients&#x02019; wellbeing may become dominant. Contingent on the share of early- and late-stage burnt-out GPs in the study, the influence of the one group may counterbalance the influence of the other.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Implications for practice</title><p>Although the absolute effect sizes may seem small, this study documented statistically significant associations between GPs&#x02019; risk attitudes and patients&#x02019; risk of having an incident PSA test and a repeated normal PSA test. It is important to emphasise that the risk attitudes were scored as continuous factors, and, for instance, an OR of 1.03 means that, for every 1-unit increase in the score, a 3% increase in the odds of taking a PSA test is expected. Therefore, a relatively large difference was seen between the GPs in the first and fourth quartiles. The mean number of incident PSA tests per year taken by the GPs included in this study was 21. As an example, the reported difference in tolerance for ambiguity corresponds to a difference in mean number of incident PSA tests of 11 per year between GPs scoring in the lowest and highest quartiles of the tolerance for ambiguity scale. On a population basis these differences between GPs&#x02019; risk-taking may have a large impact on the use of PSA testing in general practice. Furthermore, males in the 25% of practices in which the GPs reported most tolerance for ambiguity had half the probability of getting a repeated normal PSA test compared with males in the 25% of practices in which the GPs had the least tolerance for ambiguity.</p><p>Patients often expect to be treated equally and assume that their treatment is based on accepted guidelines. To empower patients to take responsibility for their own health and develop a partnership with their GP, patients should be informed that a GP&#x02019;s willingness to offer treatment in many instances depends on that GP&#x02019;s professional opinion, which is influenced by a variety of factors. Medical decision making characterised by uncertainty and ambiguity may induce discomfort in the GP, and GPs might benefit from an increased focus on the strengths and weaknesses of their personality to reduce stress and improve the professional handling of such situations.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Christina Maar Andersen for her help during data collection and Peter Hjertholm for computational guidance.</p></ack><notes><sec><title>Funding</title><p>The Centre for Cancer Diagnosis in Primary Care is funded by the Novo Nordisk Foundation and the Danish Cancer Society.

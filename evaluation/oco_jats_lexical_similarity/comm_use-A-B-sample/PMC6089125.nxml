cardiac insufficiency. It requires aggressive immune suppression therapy, although
the results are often fatal. Recently, a new entity of GCM was described. In this
form of the disease, when GCM affects only the atria, the characteristics of the
disease changes completely<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. In this case, we present first-in-man successful
treatment of a 53-year-old male patient with the diagnosis of atrial GCM, presenting
in the form of a tumor, and his status at the end of 24 months follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>CASE REPORT</title><p>A 53-year-old man, who had non-exertional chest pain with positive exercise stress
test, was hospitalized by the cardiology department. Total occlusion of the right
coronary artery (RCA) was detected in the cath-lab. After performing percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), long segment drug-eluting stents (DES) and
bare-metal stent (BMS) were placed. After the procedure he became hypotensive. In
order to exclude pericardial effusion, transthoracic echocardiography was performed.
In the left atrium (LA), a 6,5x4 cm mass was detected with LA dilatation and
estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure over tricuspid regurgitant jet was 43
mmHg. Then, he was sent to our clinic for surgery with possible diagnosis of LA
myxoma. His left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 60%. We decided to perform
surgical excision of the mass. Following median sternotomy, we reached the LA via
transseptal approach. We saw a giant mass in the LA, nearby the mitral valve. The
mitral valve was intact without any deformation. We excised the mass, which invaded
the myocardium towards the posterior wall of the LA. The LA was hypertrophic in
nature, so all the mass with LA was resected. The mass consisted of central necrotic
parts which did not resemble to atrial myxoma. Intraoperative view of the mass is
shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>. The defective posterior
atrial wall was then repaired by autologous pericardium, fixed by 0.625%
glutaraldehyde solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>).
Intraoperative frozen pathology specimen was reported as benign tissue, rich in
fibrosis, but not myxoma. After closing the septum and the right atriotomy, RCA
bypass over PD segment was performed using saphenous vein graft. The aortic
occlusion time was 141 minutes. Since the patient had first-degree heart blockage, a
temporary pacemaker lead was inserted and the operation was completed in routine
manner. Postoperative period was uneventful. He had sinus rhythm after 24 hours,
stayed in intensive care unit (ICU) for 2 days, and discharged from the hospital at
postoperative 8<sup>th</sup> day.</p><p>

</p><p>Histopathologic examination of the specimen revealed necrotic areas, lymphocytic and
histiocytic infiltration and sporadic eosinophilia in the striated muscle fibers.
There were also multinuclear giant cells. These giant cells showed positive
expression with CD45 and CD68, with the final diagnosis of GCM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">D</xref>). After the
accurate diagnosis of GCM, he was followed-up by echocardiography in the
10<sup>th</sup> day, 1<sup>st</sup> month, and every 3 months thereafter. He
clinically improved after the operation, and still had LVEF of 55% at the end of 24
months follow-ups. He took only acetylsalicylic acid (100 mg/day), ramipril (5
mg/day) and bisoprolol (5 mg/day) treatment after the operation without immune
suppression therapy.</p><p>

</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Idiopathic GCM is a rare form of fulminant myocarditis which has a poor outcome
without heart transplantation<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. The clinical presentation of GCM is usually
dramatic, but some may present an indolent course with the presence of symptoms for
months to years before the proper diagnosis is made<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. The natural course is
rapid and mortality is high if left untreated, with an average transplant-free
survival of &#x0003c;6 months. Ventricular assist device placement and immunosuppressive
regimens, including high dose steroids and cyclosporine have modestly improved the
prognosis of GCM, to almost 12 months of transplant-free survival; nevertheless,
they still need heart transplantation<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. In 2013, Larsen et al.<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>, stated that GCM located
in the atrium have distinctive clinicopathologic features with a more favorable
prognosis than classical ventricular GCM. After the first description of atrial GCM
in 1964, the largest series of atrial GCM was published by Larsen et
al.<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup><sup>]</sup> with 6 consecutive patients and in the literature
only 13 cases were found in the PubMed database search. After Larsen called
attention to distinct features of atrial GCM, Basso and Thiene<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup><sup>]</sup> stated that atrial GCM
might be more common than generally believed. As reviewed, 5 of these literature
based cases lacked history or evidence of rheumatic diseases, as did in our case.
Our case also emphasizes that atrial GCM is a distinctive disorder with its own
characteristics. As Basso and Thiene<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup><sup>]</sup> stated, the disease might be attributable to
atrium-specific autoantigens.</p><p>Tumors of the cardiovascular system are very rare diseases. There are many disorders
that do not fit into the concept of tumor or neoplasm. Among these cardiovascular
tumors, 70% of these are benign, and when surgically excised, most of them are
pathologically confirmed as benign<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. Tumors of the heart are divided into three
categories: benign tumors and tumor-like lesions, malignant tumors, and pericardial
tumors. In benign tumors, tumors were classified as tumors showing differentiation
into muscle cells such as rhabdomyoma, adult cellular rhabdomyoma, hamartoma of
mature cardiac myocytes, and histiocytoid cardiomyopathy. Cardiac myxoma and
papillary fibroelastoma are classified as pluripotent mesenchymal origin, and
cardiac fibroma and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor were classified as tumor
showing differentiation into myofibroblastic cell.</p><p>An atrial myxoma must be differentiated from a LA thrombus. Echocardiographically and
surgically, the presence of a stalk and mobility favors atrial myxoma whereas the
thrombus is usually situated in the posterior portion of the atrium with a layered
appearance. On the other hand, myocarditis is a diffuse inflammatory process of the
myocardium, although instances of focal myocarditis in the right/LV or LA may be
present rarely as in our case.</p><p>Rheumatic fever (RF), sarcoidosis, specific infections and gout should be considered
in the differential diagnosis. Both GCM and cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) are presented
in similarly aged patients. Unlike GCM, CS is characterized by tight nonnecrotizing
granulomas, with central multinucleated giant cells. Fibrosis is more pronounced in
CS than in GCM<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. The absence of necrosis of rheumatoid myocarditis
without Aschoff cells excluded the diagnosis of RF and the absence of granulomatous
structures in our case excludes sarcoidosis in the differential diagnosis. Both GCM
and CS may present with ventricular tachycardia, presentation with acute-onset heart
failure is more commonly seen in GCM, while presentation with heart block is more
predictive of CS<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. Although GCM does not form a mass lesion in
general, it is not a must and this is the first report of atrial GCM forming a mass
lesion in the literature.</p><p>We believe that more case reports and possibly series will be reported in near future
as the importance and unique properties of this disease are learned. In this case,
we clearly identified the borders of the mass limited in the LA and total removal of
the mass improved patient's quality of life with no additional treatment.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="5%" span="1"/><col width="95%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">OT</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Substantial contributions to the

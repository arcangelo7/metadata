and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) have been increasing due to the
aging of the general population and the results of large clinical trials showing
benefit for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In addition, the rising number of comorbidities per patient as well as the use of
cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) devices, which require more leads to be
implanted, contribute to the increasing need for lead extractions as a result of
infections, failed leads and device recalls<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Even though up to 30,000 lead extraction procedures are performed annually worldwide,
no standard approach has been established<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Transvenous lead extraction is the preferred method of treatment of CIED-related
complications, as it has improved over time, becoming safer and more effective. It
uses methods that vary from simple local traction to the use of powered laser
sheaths, with a global trend towards the increasingly technological tools, meant to
improve the procedure&#x02019;s outcomes<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The choice to perform an extraction should be weighed carefully, following
internationally accepted recommendations and an individualized approach, since these
procedures carry the risk of acute morbidity and mortality and may have poor
long-term outcomes<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Simple manual lead traction was once widely used, but due to the avulsion, laceration
or perforation related cases, it became obsolete in many developed countries. In our
hospital, a public cardiology center in the Northeast of Brazil, the availability of
lead extraction tools is low, then manual lead traction remains an accepted
procedure.</p></sec><sec><title>OBJECTIVE</title><p>The aim of this study is to demonstrate the experience of a Brazilian Center that
uses simple manual traction in most of the lead removals performed annually,
questioning the real need for expensive and technically challenging new devices.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>This retrospective observational study included 35 consecutive patients who had a
transvenous lead extraction in the period of a year between January 1998 and October
2014 at Hospital de Messejana Dr. Carlos Alberto Studart Gomes, Fortaleza, CE,
Brazil. Data were collected through a records review.</p><p>All the procedures were done by the same expert surgeon in an operative room using a
mobile C-Arm image intensifier. Simple manual traction and extraction with Cook
extractor were done under local anesthesia plus IV sedation. Open heart surgeries
were done under general anesthesia.</p><p>Immediately after surgery and 24 hours later, patients had complete blood count,
chest radiograph and electrocardiogram done to look for possible complications.
Clinical and surgical complications were observed throughout hospitalization and
additional exams were requested if needed by the primary cardiology team. Patients
had outpatient visits within one week and then after one month. After the initial
visits, they were seen every six months in the pacemaker outpatient service. It was
defined as a complication related to the procedure: death, infection,
hemopericardium, hemothorax, pneumothorax, bleeding requiring blood transfusion and
other pulmonary complications.</p><p>Simple manual traction technique - After removal of the device and dissection of
fibrous tissue around the lead, simple traction of the lead was performed following
insertion of a non-locking stylet and retrieval of screws until the separation of
the lead from the myocardium and venous system was accomplished.</p><p>Non-powered traction tools with Cook kit - After removal of the device and dissection
of fibrous tissue around the lead, the locking stylets slide into the lumen of a
lead and advance to its tip where they were locked into position, directing the
force of traction to the length or at their distal end. Mechanical dilator sheaths
were advanced along the lead to disrupt and dilate the fibrotic attachments. If
calcified, the single sheath technique often required rotational movement to
succeed.</p><p>Open heart surgery - a combined transvenous and open surgical extraction approach was
undertaken. Median sternotomy was performed, followed by cardiopulmonary bypass and
cardiac arrest. Initially, the leads were cut at the superior vena cava level and
extracted from the right ventricle and atrium. Then, with the patient out of
cardio-pulmonary bypass, the generator and the leads parts from the subclavian to
the superior vena cava were withdrawn.</p><p>Non-powered traction tools were used depending on the availability of the material in
our institution. Open heart surgery was done only when the patients had
contraindications to the other procedures, such as concomitant need of surgical
repair or large vegetations.</p><p>They were evaluated based on age, type of device, dwelling time, indication for
removal, technique used and immediate outcomes.</p><p>At the end of data collection, 36 procedures were described in 35 patients and their
data were tabulated in Microsoft Excel spreadsheets for simple descriptive
analysis.</p><p>This project was accepted and approved by the local Ethics Committee of the Hospital
de Messejana on February 8, 2015. This research did not receive any specific grant
from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The median dwelling time of the devices was 46.22 months, ranging from 0.25 to 180
months. The main indication for removal was infection, accounting for 55.6% of the
cases (including patients who had extrusion of the system, with or without
associated infective endocarditis, along with those who had isolated infections and
one case of septic shock). Lead fracture was the second most common issue (40.06%),

worldwide, leading to a high risk of death if left untreated<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. They were the most
common indication in the population study.</p><p>The number of device-related infections have increased disproportionately to the
implantation rate, most likely for multifactorial reasons: raised awareness, use of
systems that demand more complex procedures (such as ICDs and CRT), as well as the
growing number of elderly patients with multiple comorbidities in use of
CIED<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>It is important to point out that an infection of any component of the CIED implies
compromise of the entire system. Therefore, once diagnosed, all the components
should be removed and antibiotic therapy initiated<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Lead recalls and malfunctions have increasing the number of extractions, despite
improvements in design and performance. Lead failure can represent the breakdown of
any of its components, including insulation, conductors, connectors, terminal pins,
electrodes, and coils<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>We observed one case of inappropriate shock due to noise, which usually occurs
secondary to device malfunction, as well as 15 cases of lead failures due to
fractures.</p><p>Factors influencing the lead extraction outcomes are lead implantation duration; lead
tip location and properties (presence of defibrillator coils, lead type and
insulation material), presence of infection, individual anatomy and physician
experience<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Fibrosis and adherence are expected complications, for which the challenges and risks
associated with lead extraction are mainly related. They preclude lead removal
through simple manual traction, as this might cause avulsion, laceration or
perforation<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>A large number of extraction tools have been developed to minimize or eliminate
complications. The majority of lead extraction procedures were performed from the
lead venous entry site but, in cases of failure, femoral or internal jugular
approach can be used<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Our cardiology center is a public health institution and therefore relies on
government resources, which are often scarce. Simple manual traction is the most
widely used method since mechanical extractors are costly and not widely available,
forcing the surgeons to develop experience in this technique in different
scenarios.</p><p>Similar conditions were present in the study by Jo et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>, who evaluated
promptly available tools as alternatives to more expensive methods. Their success
rate was 70% using simple manual traction, safer and more effective, specially for
the extraction of infected leads and those with a short dwelling
time<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Paraskevaidis et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> showed success rates above 90% using non-powered
traction tools, with minimal complications. In a study that used laser-powered
sheaths followed by mechanical tools, patients had complete extraction in more than
95% of the cases, with complications in less than 1%<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. In the PLEXES trial,
the efficacy and safety of laser sheaths were tested against conventional lead
extraction methods in 301 patients with 465 chronically implanted pacemaker leads
and the complete lead removal rate was significantly higher in the laser group and
was reported to be up to 94%<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>. More recently, the Lead Extraction in the
Contemporary Setting (LEXICON) study reported the outcomes of laser-assisted
extraction of 2,405 leads in 1,449 consecutive patients and the overall procedural
success rate associated with complete lead removal was 96.5% and major complications
in 1.4% of the 1449 patients enrolled, with death in 0.28% (deaths caused by
vascular tears)<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Our success rates with manual traction are satisfactory, even for leads with very
long dwell times, despite the well-recognized possible complications of this
technique. The few available local resources compel physicians to master techniques
that have been traded for innovations in many parts of the world. We thereby
demonstrate that classic methods can still be performed safely and effectively.</p><p>The complications in our study were a diaphragmatic palsy (minor complication) and
endocarditis. When compared to other studies, the rate of complications was
acceptable. No death, hemopericardium, pleural effusions or other major
complications were observed.</p><p>This study has limitations. It was conducted in a single local center and only single
surgeon procedures were included. It was observational and did not have a control
group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This article suggests that lead extraction by simple manual traction can still be
performed safely and effectively in countries with economic difficulties as a first
attempt in selected patients, leaving expensive auxiliary tools for a second attempt
in case of failure or contraindications for simple manual traction technique.</p><p>Simple manual traction, however, may cause lead damage and it might preclude to use
active tools in a second time. Therefore, any traction in the lead must be done with
caution and if there is any risk of lead damage the approach must be suspended and
the active tools should be used.</p><table-wrap id="t3" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="5%" span="1"/><col width="95%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Author's roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NAL</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Substantial contributions to the

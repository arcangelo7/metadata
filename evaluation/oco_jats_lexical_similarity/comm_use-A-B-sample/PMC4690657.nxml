oxygen species (ROS) produced during reperfusion, many researches have been
developed in search of an experimental model that could minimize this process in
order to reduce the cellular and organic damage ischemia and reperfusion
(I/R)<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The best results ever published in controlling the production of ROS were obtained
with the ischemic preconditioning, as numerous publications that followed Murry et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>,
including the mesenteric I/R. However, there is little applicability in clinical
situations for the ischemic preconditioning, for example, in the acute abdomen with
mesenteric ischemia, when the diagnosis is made when the ischemia already exists and
it's impossible to use this method.</p><p>In 2003, Zhao et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> presented the concept of ischemic postconditioning
(IPC), which consists of making one or more short cycles of reperfusion followed by
one or more short cycles of ischemia, immediately after ischemia period and before
to give permanent reperfusion.</p><p>In experimental model, there is already evidence of the IPC protective effect on the
intestinal mucosa of rats undergoing mesenteric I/R<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>, and recently, IPC was able
to minimize the severity of liver injury in rats undergoing I/R<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. Several published
experiments examined the effects of IPC in other organs and tissues, among which may
be mentioned Darling et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> in which the IPC was able to minimize the infarction
area of myocardium in rabbits. Tang et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> demonstrated the effectiveness of IPC in
preventing injuries resulting from the coronary I/R in rats, since the ischemia time
did not exceed 45 minutes. Huang et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> demonstrated that IPC were preventing tissue damage
in the spinal cord of rats subjected to I/R. Santos et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> showed that the ischemic
preconditioning and IPC were able to minimize the tissue injury in the intestines of
rats subjected to mesenteric I/R process.</p><p>However, reperfusion injury can not only affect the ischemic and then reperfused
organ, but can also damage remote organs, such as pulmonary edema presented after
some I/R process. The restoration of hemodynamic stability after a circulatory shock
is a clinical situation of I/R, with the possibility of extensive damage because the
amount of tissues involved<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>It was believed that the lung was more resistant to ischemic injury than other
organs. Two factors contribute to either: the presence of bronchial circulation
beyond the pulmonary circulation and the fact that the interruption of pulmonary
blood flow is not accompanied by hypoxia, since the alveolar ventilation is
maintained. The lung can be considered as the only organ that can undergo ischemia
without hypoxia<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>However, in recent years some evidence has emerged that the lung can not be
completely immune to reperfusion injury maintained despite the gas exchange, since
the ROS act systemically. In surgeries with temporary occlusion of the aorta,
pulmonary edema constitutes a common complication, by a multifactorial pathway,
including reperfusion injury. Already during ischemia, there is an increase in
pulmonary arterial pressure, a factor that may favor the formation of edema in the
lungs. This increased resistance in the pulmonary circulation is a result in part of
a larger blood flow, due to its redistribution to the territory above the occlusion,
and increased left ventricular end-diastolic volume, which emptying is impaired by
increasing the aortic occlusion imposed on the afterload<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Mesenteric I/R is associated with the production of other inflammatory mediator, the
tumor necrosis factor (TNF). The intestinal mucosal injury by I/R allows the release
of endotoxin to the portal circulation, inducing TNF production by hepatic
macrophages. The increased of TNF in the systemic circulation can lead to
inflammatory lung injury characterized by neutrophil accumulation. This sequence of
events was demonstrated by Caty et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> in a model of I/R by temporary occlusion of the
superior mesenteric artery in rats. After reperfusion, there was increase in
endotoxin levels in portal venous blood and TNF in the systemic circulation. At the
same time there was accumulation of neutrophils in the lungs and increased pulmonary
capillary permeability.</p><p>The question, however, is how long the periods of ischemia and reperfusion must last
to cause reperfusion injury not only in the intestine but also in the lung.
Furthermore, the mechanisms used for the prevention of reperfusion injuries, such as
IPC, would be capable of not only preventing intestinal tissue damage but also the
remote lesions.</p><p>Thus, considering that there are different experimental models of I/R, is too
relevant and is the aim of this study to verify if a model that causes intestinal
damage can also cause lung reperfusion injury, and if the IPC can minimize such
lesions.</p><sec><title>Objective</title><p>To assess the presence of pulmonary reperfusion injury and the protective effect

artery with vascular clamp and reperfusion for 60 minutes. Among ischemia and
reperfusion were performed four cycles of reperfusion (30 seconds each) interleaved
by four ischemia cycles (30 seconds each).</p><p>The animals were weighed on an electronic precision scale and anesthetized by
intraperitoneal injection of solution 2:1 of Ketamine hydrochloride
(Cetamin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>), 50 mg/ml, and Xylazine hydrochloride
(Xilazin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>), 20 mg/ml, respectively, at a dose of 0.1 ml/100g.
The rats were considered anesthetized after being found loss of eyelid reflex, loss
of response to mechanical stimuli, loss of righting reflex and withdrawing member
after painful stimulus caused by hold.</p><p>After, the anesthetized rats underwent abdominal trichotomy and were positioned to
the operating table in the supine position with the four members in abduction. Then
a longitudinal median laparotomy of about four centimeters was performed,
exteriorization of the small intestine, identification and dissection of the cranial
mesenteric artery.</p><p>In group A, the cranial mesenteric artery was occluded with atraumatic vascular clamp
which remained for 30 minutes (ischemic phase). After placing the clamp, the small
intestine was repositioned in the abdominal cavity and the wound was closed with a
continuous suture of the skin with nylon monofilament (mononylon<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>)
4-0. After the stage of ischemia, the abdominal wall was opened again by removing
the suture and the vascular clamp was removed, beginning the reperfusion phase,
lasting 60 minutes. Started the reperfusion, the abdomen was again closed by
continuous suture of the skin with nylon monofilament 4-0 until the end of the
experiment.</p><p>In group B, after ischemia phase (30 minutes), IPC was performed through two cycles
of ischemia, lasting two minutes each (removal of the clamp of the cranial
mesenteric artery), interspersed with two cycles of ischemia also lasting two
minutes each (application of atraumatic vascular clamp in the cranial mesenteric
artery). After, there was the reperfusion for 60 minutes.</p><p>In group C was performed ischemia phase (30 minutes) and reperfusion (60 minutes).
Preceding the reperfusion was performed IPC through four cycles of reperfusion
(removal of atraumatic vascular clamp of the cranial mesenteric artery) lasting 30
seconds each, interspersed with four cycles of ischemia (occlusion of the cranial
mesenteric artery by atraumatic vascular clamp), also lasting 30 seconds each.</p><p>After completion of reperfusion in all groups, thoracotomy was performed and

permeability, depending on the time and intensity of this process. He et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>
demonstrated that morphological changes occur as injury mucosa, villous erosion,
necrosis, interstitial congestion in the lamina propria, edema, inflammation and
submucosal hemorrhage. This increased intestinal permeability leading to bacterial
translocation which can contribute to a systemic inflammatory response mediated by
cytokines. The HMGB1 protein is an endogenous ligand that plays an important role in
this process and is directly related to sepsis and increased mortality. In the early
stages of I/R, there is an immediate increase of HMGB1 that continues increasing
slowly during reperfusion and can lead to accumulation of neutrophils and pulmonary
edema<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In addition to the cytokines, the activation of the immune system by ischemic bowel
produces TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6. Systemic inflammatory response after I/R activates
neutrophils, which are sequestered in the pulmonary microcirculation with the
consequent increase in endothelial and epithelial permeability, extravasation of
fluids and proteins, leukocytes sequestration and increased injury to the
endothelium of the pulmonary capillaries<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>. Certainly this process will be more intense and
damaging as the I/R has a longer duration, resulting in increased intestinal
permeability and greater local and remote inflammatory process. This could justify
the fact that in this study we observed mild lung injury, while other publications
using longer periods of I/R has demonstrated increased lung damage.</p><p>This fact was noted in the publication of Guido et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> in which the authors
performed ischemia for 45 minutes and reperfusion for two and 24 hours, finding lung
injury histologically moderate to intense. The authors observed that the reperfusion
period is a crucial factor for the appearance of the lesion at a distance,
especially the lung, as evidenced by the lower accumulation of neutrophils in the
lung parenchyma after two hours of reperfusion compared to 24 hours when there was
higher concentration of these cells.</p><p>Using 30 minutes of ischemia and three hours of reperfusion, Lapchak et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>
showed no statistical difference in the concentration of neutrophils in the lungs of
rats undergoing mesenteric I/R compared to the SHAM group, which may be related to a
lower period of ischemia than in other publications that noted higher neutrophil
concentration.</p><p>Several studies have confirmed the presence of lung injury after I/R, such as the
publication of Wang et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> in which the authors applied mesenteric I/R for 60 and
120 minutes, respectively, observing moderate lung injury. Also Sotoudeh et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>
obtained moderate degree of lung injury performing a study with ischemia for two
hours of rats' femoral artery and 24 hours of reperfusion. Although there was a
higher degree of lung injury in this study, one must consider the great difference
of the adopted periods of I/R as well as the organ subjected to this process.</p><p>He et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>
achieved average 2.5 of lung injury using the classification proposed by Sizlan et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> in
intestinal I/R. These authors used Sprague-Dawley rats with periods of I/R higher
than those employed here, 45 and 120 minutes, respectively.</p><p>Idrovo et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>
also performed mesenteric I/R in Sprague Dawley rats, however, with ischemia lasting
90 minutes and reperfusion four hours. They evaluated the pulmonary repercussion of
this process and observed a moderate to severe injury by histological
classification. It should here point out that the difference with the results
obtained here is probably due to long periods of I/R used by these authors.</p><p>Thomaz Neto et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> had already shown that the mesenteric I/R process
causes mild lung injury, and that this can be minimized by ischemic preconditioning.
However, this method of prevention has limited clinical applicability, since the
identifying mesenteric ischemia no further opportunity for their use. In this study
were used periods of I/R of 30 minutes. The IPC would have greater clinical
applicability in situations like this, since this has been shown to be effective in
preventing or decreasing reperfusion injury in various organs investigated,
including the intestine. However, despite its proven efficacy, there are no studies
in the scientific literature reviewed of IPC on prevention of remote injury in the
mesenteric I/R process. In this study there was no difference between the group
submitted only to the I/R and the two groups treated by IPC.</p><p>Recently, Dorsa et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> had demonstrated a protective effect of IPC on lung of
rats undergoing aortic ischemia and reperfusion process. They have used also 30
minutes of ischemia and 60 minutes of reperfusion, but it was made by aortic
occlusion, differently of our research. Another difference relates to number of
cycles, once they used three cycles of IPC and we applied just two cycles of two
minutes each.</p><p>The IPC protective mechanism in the mesenteric I/R process is still not entirely
clear, but there is evidence that IPC may be related to a significant decrease in
the levels of malondialdehyde and products related to lipid peroxidation. These
observations suggest a reduction in the production of ROS and less injury mediated
by oxidants with IPC<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The peak of ROS production occurs between the first and seventh minute after
initiation of reperfusion, although such substances are detectable in later periods.
An abundant production of ROS during this initial phase of reperfusion has been
implicated as a major factor in the pathogenesis of tissue injury<sup>[<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup>. The IPC acts at this
stage, through a pathway not fully understood, probably reducing the production of
ROS by the gradual release of oxygen to tissues<sup>[<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Thus, considering what is known today about the mechanism of action of the IPC, this
also supposed to decrease injuries to the distance as in the case of the lung.
However, we must consider that there is still much to discover regarding the
pathophysiology of the process and about the many mechanisms and drugs used to
prevent reperfusion injury. In analyzing the articles cited here, although we have
observed a considerable number of publications showing ways to prevent remote lung
injury, there is no standardization in methods, making it very difficult to compare
them. Besides the difference between animals used, the variation in the periods of
mesenteric ischemia and reperfusion is very large, and therefore, this should lead
to a variety of lung injury in intensity.</p><p>The data in our publication leave us the information that 30 and 60 minutes of
mesenteric I/R cause mild lung injury, unlike what happens in the gut, where
literature shows that there is high grade of injury<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. That means that the lung
can withstand more than the intestine subjected to I/R. Although IPC has not been
helpful in minimizing lung reperfusion injury in this study, there is a doubt as to
its effectiveness in the case of most lung damage, and this should be studied in
future research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The mesenteric ischemia and reperfusion in rats for thirty and sixty minutes,
respectively, caused mild reperfusion lung injury. Ischemic postconditioning was not
able to minimize the pulmonary reperfusion injury and there was no difference
between two cycles of two minutes with four cycles of 30 seconds.</p><table-wrap id="t3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-top-style:solid"><th colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1">

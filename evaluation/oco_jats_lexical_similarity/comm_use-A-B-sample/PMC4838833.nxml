However, sedentary behaviour is considered a health risk independent of physical activity, and is recognised in public health guidelines advising against prolonged sedentary time. There has been very little research on athletes&#x02019; physical activity behaviour outside elite sport.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Given health and performance links, we investigated in-season post-training activity levels in 28 elite professional footballers during the English Premiership season. Players volunteered to wear a triaxial wrist accelerometer for 1&#x02005;week, removing it only for training and matches. In total, 25 players met the inclusion criteria for analysis. Players recorded on average 632.6&#x02005;min wear time p/day during the post-training period (SD&#x000b1;52.9) for a mean of 3.8&#x02005;days (SD&#x000b1;1.5).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>On average, players recorded 76.2&#x02005;min p/day (SD&#x000b1;28.8) of moderate or vigorous activity post-training.

This raises questions over optimum recovery and performance, as well as long-term health and cardiovascular risk. Worryingly, retirement from elite sport is likely to further imbalance activity and sedentary behaviour. Promoting regular periodic light to moderate leisure time activity could be beneficial.

In the short term, athletes&#x02019; lifestyles may compromise their recovery and performance. In the long term, poor lifestyles may pose health risks after the athlete has retired.</p><p>Sedentary behaviour has been defined as any waking behaviour characterised by an energy expenditure under 1.5 metabolic equivalents (MET; one MET is the same as 1 kcal/kg/hour and is roughly equivalent to the energy cost of not moving) while in a sitting or reclining posture.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In adults, excessive sitting has been independently associated with adverse health, including abnormal glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, obesity, cardiovascular disease and mortality.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>

<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Sitting for more than 10&#x02005;h per day has been associated with higher body mass index and waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total serum cholesterol, triglycerides and non-fasting glucose levels, compared to those reporting a total sitting time of less than 4&#x02005;h per day.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In a controlled trial, replacing sitting with just 2&#x02005;min of walking every 20&#x02005;min was shown to reduce serum insulin and postprandial blood glucose by 24%, and lower blood pressure by a mean of 2&#x02013;3&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> These findings suggest that adults should be encouraged to reduce their daily total sedentary time.

Indeed, these findings suggest far greater levels of sedentariness than other previously studied populations. Given the genetic, proteomic, metabolomic, physiological and epidemiological evidence available, our findings have led us to question whether such a high proportion of sedentary time is the best method for optimum recovery, optimum performance and longer term health outcomes.</p><p>Perhaps of most concern is the likelihood of further imbalance between physical activity and sedentariness following retirement, should these behaviours continue. Coupled with the possibility of a less athletic diet and increasing age, risk factors for chronic disease may begin to mount. Fitness, which is an important health determinant in its own right,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> declines rapidly with deconditioning and age, and there is evidence that added life expectancy is only likely if physical activity is maintained after retirement from elite competition.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Thus, having previously been a fit athlete does not necessarily confer long-term protection to cardiometabolic health.</p><p>To date, there are no specific recommendations on breaking up sedentary time, particularly for elite athletes, and more evidence is required to establish firm guidelines. The current available evidence suggests that during waking hours, breaking up sitting every 20&#x02005;min by standing up or walking may be beneficial for cardiometabolic health, although further evidence is required to establish firm recommendations.</p><p>Delivering accurate and effective lifestyle advice to professional athletes to help establish favourable patterns of physical activity behaviours could benefit their recovery and performance while in their profession and importantly improve health in the long term after retirement from professional sport. Primary targets could include athletes coming up to retirement, those who are not involved in regular competitive action, as well as athletes who show evidence of greater than average detriments to fitness and body composition following the off season.</p><p>Interventions could be provided by club medical staff and via professional sports governing bodies or players&#x02019; associations. They should be tailored and based on the athlete's contextual information, such as family, local environment or modes of transport available. Movement sensors such as the device used in the present study can be useful in monitoring and providing feedback to players. Our data have allowed the participants to implement and test changes to their lifestyles, using adapted rest and recovery strategies, lifestyle behaviour change strategies and ongoing feedback systems.</p><p>This study indicates a necessity to explore sedentary behaviour profiles more widely and deeply in athletes. Our pilot study was limited to elite male professional footballers in one club in the English Premier League; thus, we are unable to generalise our results to other athletes, sports, females and different populations. There may be variability in sedentary behaviour between sports, and other sociobiological and environmental determinants, which could include demographics such as cohabitants, ethnicity, culture and socioeconomic strata. Future work will analyse correlations between leisure-time activity patterns on injury risk and performance parameters, and also look at a more detailed analysis of periods of unbroken sedentary time.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Professional footballers spend the majority of their leisure time in sedentary activity, raising questions over optimum recovery, performance and perhaps injury risk, as well as long-term health. Worryingly, retirement from elite sport is likely to further imbalance activity and sedentary behaviour. Promoting regular periodic light to moderate leisure time activity could be beneficial. We advocate further research and wider provision of education and support for footballers in lifestyle management.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>MH is supported by the British Heart Foundation (RE/10/005/28296).

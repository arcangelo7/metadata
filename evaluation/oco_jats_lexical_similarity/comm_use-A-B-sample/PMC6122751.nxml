congenital macrovascular malformation. This case involves a 9-year-old boy with
aortopulmonary septal defect (type I combined with type IV). Before surgery,
milrinone and alprostadil were used to counteract high lung pressure. Surgery
was performed under cardiopulmonary bypass, following which the pulmonary
pressure decreased. The aorta was cut, and the right pulmonary artery opening
was connected with the main pulmonary artery septal defect using polyester
patch. An internal tunnel was made, and the deformity correction was completed.
The child exhibited normal postoperative recovery with no discomfort. A complex
aortopulmonary window is a rare condition that can be treated successfully with
appropriate preoperative and surgical management.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Aortopulmonary Septal Defect</kwd><kwd>Heart Defects, Congenital</kwd><kwd>Surgery</kwd><kwd>Cardiovascular Surgical Procedures</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>National Natural Science Foundation of China</funding-source><award-id>81460073</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department-Kunming

congenital macrovascular malformation. According to Stansel et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>, only less than 100 cases
have been reported to date. The defect is located between the ascending aorta and
the common pulmonary artery and is associated with a rapid progression of pulmonary
arterial hypertension, unless it is corrected surgically<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Its pathophysiology and
clinical manifestations resemble those of patent ductus arteriosus. The
aortopulmonary window is used for surgery and interventional blockade treatment.
Reports indicate that even in patients with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension
with elevated pulmonary vascular resistance, aortic pulmonary window can be
successfully corrected and most patients had satisfactory long-term
outcomes<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.
Moreover, it is also safe in children beyond infancy (age range 14 months-12 years)
with acceptable early and mid-term outcomes<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. We report a case where surgical repair of
complex aortopulmonary window was successfully performed in a nine-year old boy.</p></sec><sec><title>CASE REPORT</title><p>A nine-year-old male child, with a prior history of heart murmur at birth, was
admitted to our hospital on July 2, 2017. He presented with minor symptoms,
comprising low activity, frequent cold compared to normal children, minor cyanosis
and tachypnea after exercise. At the time of presentation, the heart rate was 105
beats/min, while the respiratory rate and blood pressure were 20 breaths/min and
109/67 mmHg, respectively. Short systolic II/6 rough noises were heard at the left
margin of 4-5 ribs of the sternum, along with signs of loud P2 pulmonary
hypertension. Post-admission arterial blood gases were 47.3 mmHg (partial pressure
of oxygen = PO<sub>2</sub>) and 29.2 mmHg (partial pressure of carbon dioxide =
PCO<sub>2</sub>). The computed tomography (CT) scan of the large thoracic and
abdominal vessels showed the following findings: no aortic coarctation occurred; the
right pulmonary artery originated from the ascending aorta; and the defect, which
measured approximately 2.10-2.16 cm, was located between the pulmonary and the main
artery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">1B</xref>). Echocardiography (ECHO) result showed an aortopulmonary
window (type I). The abnormal pathway (width: 1.73-2.09 cm) was found between the
ascending aorta and the pulmonary artery. The estimated pulmonary artery pressure
was 71 mmHg, with shunting from left to right. The electrocardiography (EKG) result
also indicated that a high-voltage sinus rhythm occurred at the left ventricle and
that the T wave changed on the anterior wall. Preoperative pulmonary artery
resistance was of 7 Wood units, which was measured during the heart catheterization
exam. Alprostadil (10 &#x000b5;g, with 0.17 &#x000b5;g/min intravenous infusion) and
milrinone (0.375 &#x000b5;g/kg.min, with 24 h continuous intravenous infusion) were
administered to reduce the pulmonary arterial pressure. Blood gases were found to be
55.7 mmHg (PO<sub>2</sub>) and 29.6 mmHg (PCO<sub>2</sub>) when retested after 14
days of hospital admission. Meanwhile, EKG results again showed the aortopulmonary
window (type I) with an abnormal pathway (width: 1.73-2.09 cm) between the ascending
aorta and the pulmonary artery. The estimated pulmonary artery pressure was 63 mmHg,
with shunting from left to right. The precordial murmur was louder than that before
admission.</p><p>

</p><p>The patient underwent aortopulmonary septal defect repair under general anesthesia 15
days after admission. Aortic cannulation was placed below the right arm artery
(cannulation of the superior and the inferior vena cavae). The ascending aorta was
blocked at 35&#x000ba;C degrees, longitudinally cut, and cardiac protective solution
[custodiol / histidine-tryptophan-ketogluterate (HTK)] was poured
under direct vision. The review indicated that the right pulmonary artery originated
from the ascending aorta. The defect, which measured approximately 2.0-2.5 cm, was
observed between the ascending aorta and the pulmonary artery. The opening of the
right pulmonary artery was connected to the defect. We used a polyester patch to
separate the right pulmonary artery from communicating to the aorta and to correct
the aortopulmonary septal defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figures 2A</xref>,
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">C</xref>). The aortic incision was then sutured and the heart re-warmed to
37&#x000ba;C. The ascending aorta was opened after full exhaustion, and the heart was
automatically resuscitated. The use of alprostadil and milrinone was continued to
reduce lung pressure. The tracheal intubation was removed 4 hours after anesthetic
awareness. Postoperative recovery was successful. The heart color ultrasound on the
10<sup>th</sup> day presented the following result: no residual shunt was
observed after the repair of aortopulmonary septal defect, the pressure in the
pulmonary artery was slightly elevated, and the estimated pulmonary artery pressure
was 42 mmHg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). After the surgery, the
patient refused re-catheterization and ultrasound was performed for measuring
pulmonary artery resistance. The patient was discharged from the hospital with
indication to take oral captopril. The patient exhibited no symptom of discomfort
during the follow-up visit.</p><p>

</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The aortopulmonary window is an extremely rare cardiac anomaly resulting from
incomplete development of conotrucal septum<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>,
with an incidence rate of 0.2-0.6% of all congenital heart
diseases<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.
It is categorized into three types by Mori: (1) type I or proximal defect, which is
located 1-1.5 cm away from the aortic valve, (2) type II or distal defect, which
appears and disappears between the distal ascending aorta and the pulmonary artery,
and (3) type III or the complete defect<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. At present, the right pulmonary artery that
originates from the aorta is classified as type IV defect<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. In this case study, the patient suffers from an
extremely rare deformity, <italic>i.e</italic>., type I combined with type IV. The
survival of patients with aortopulmonary window depends on the defect size and the
pulmonary vascular resistance. The repair of aortopulmonary window is ideally
performed in infancy, before irreversible pulmonary arterial hypertension has
developed<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>. In cases where severe
defects remain untreated, most patients may die of heart failure and only a few may
live until adolescence or adulthood. Undergoing surgery (in most cases) or vascular
occlusion (in small restrictive defects) to achieve early closure is the best
treatment to guarantee the survival of patients<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. In this specific case, the defect went
unnoticed until 9 years of age, and he could have survived until late childhood
without active treatment. The major decision factors in the treatment of children
presenting with defects beyond infancy are the assessment of operability, the
postoperative management of pulmonary hypertension, and long-term
outcomes<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.
Previous reports demonstrated favorable early and long-term outcomes after surgical
correction, regardless of age or pulmonary vascular resistance<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. Based on these reports, we decided to proceed with the
surgical repair of the defect in the subject. Reduction in the pre-operative
pulmonary artery pressure was achieved by the administration of milrinone and
alprostadil. The surgery was uneventful and the post-operative recovery successful.
This experience demonstrates that we can reduce pulmonary artery pressure by
actively reducing the lung pressure and underscores the importance of surgical
repair even in complex defects. As suggested previously, our report strongly
supports that surgical repair should be offered as soon as the diagnosis is
established, regardless of the patient's age. In addition, for patients who are
responsive to pulmonary hypertension treatments <italic>i.e</italic>. with reduced
blood pressure in the lung, surgery should be considered. Patients with an
aortopulmonary window should immediately undergo surgery, and the surgical method
should be determined based on the type of preoperative deformity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>A complex aortopulmonary window is a rare condition that can be treated successfully

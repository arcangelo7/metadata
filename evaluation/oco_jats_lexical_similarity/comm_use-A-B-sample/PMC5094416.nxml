rate rising up to 10% in advanced ages (over 65 years of age). It has an incidence of 40-60%
in patients with mitral valvular disorders, and 5-10% in patients with aortic valvular
disorders<sup>[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. The prevalence of AF was
reported as 0.16% in the 40-59 age group, and 2.16% in patients over 60 years of age, in
Turkey<sup>[<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Medical treatment may be insufficient in controlling the rate of AF, or intolerance may
develop against antiarrhythmic agents, due to their side effects. Additionally, AF is known
to reduce the life quality of patients due to causes such as heart failure, hemodynamic
instability, palpitations, and thromboembolic events. For this reason, in patients with AF
undergoing openheart surgery, surgical ablation is performed in order to provide sinus
rhythm (SR) and avoid AF-related complications that may develop in the postoperative period.
Surgical ablation techniques intend to achieve SR by terminating AF, together with regaining
atrioventricular synchronization and atrial contractility function. The method, described by
Dr. Cox, in 1980, and developed as 'Maze I' thereafter, is the gold standard in surgical
treatment of AF, with a success rate of 99% today<sup>[<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. However, since the procedure
is technically difficult, the cardiopulmonary bypass and operation times are long, and the
risks for complications such as postoperative bleeding are high, thus, simpler and easier
techniques, which are developed by using different energy sources, have gained widespread
applicability. Irrigated radiofrequency ablation is one of the frequently implemented
ablation methods, and it is used as monopolar and bipolar radiofrequency (RF) ablation in
our clinic. In this study, our aim was to analyze our surgical experience and results in
patients who had undergone mitral valve surgery and left atrial RF ablation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>Forty patients (15 males, 25 females; mean age 52.05&#x000b1;9.9; range 32-74) underwent
surgery for AF associated with mitral valvular disease. All patients manifested AF, which
started at least six months before the surgical intervention. In addition to mitral valve
surgery and RF ablation, coronary artery bypass, DeVega tricuspid annuloplasty, left
ventricular aneurysm repair, and left atrial thrombus excision were performed. Without
considering performed surgical procedures, irrigated-monopolar RF ablation was used in 35
patients and irrigated-bipolar was used in five patients. The performed surgical procedures
were as follows: mechanical valve replacement in 10 patients, bioprosthetic mitral valve
replacement in 5 patients, mechanical mitral valve replacement and tricuspid commissurotomy
in 2 patients, mechanical mitral valve replacement and left atrial thrombectomy in 3
patients, bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement and DeVega tricuspid annuloplasty and left
atrial thrombectomy in 1 patient, bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement and splenectomy in
1 patient, bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement and tricuspid annuloplasty in 7 patients,
mechanical mitral valve replacement and tricuspid annuloplasty in 3 patients, single-vessel
coronary artery bypass and mechanical mitral valve replacement in 2 patients, triple-vessel
coronary artery bypass and bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement and tricuspid annuloplasty
in 1 patient, mechanical mitral valve replacement and aortic wrapping in 1 patient,
mechanical mitral valve replacement and Bentall procedure in 1 patient, bioprosthetic mitral
and aortic valve replacement in 1 patient, mechanical aortic and mitral valve replacement in
1 patient.</p><p>In the preoperative period, the left atrium (LA) size was measured as 53.5&#x000b1;6.2 mm,
in average (range 33-63 mm); in seven patients, LA was 60 mm or over. The preoperative
pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) was 49.8&#x000b1;16.4 mmHg, in average (range 30-100 mmHg);
in 57 (72.2%) patients, PAP was 40 mmHg or over. In the preoperative period, EuroSCORE
revealed that the standard EuroSCORE 2 value was 2.9&#x000b1;2.4, in average (range 0-9), and
the logistic EuroSCORE 2 value was 3.1&#x000b1;2.1%, in average (range 0.8%-16.8%).</p><p>In one patient, mitral valve replacement and splenectomy were performed due to infective
endocarditis.</p><p>The unipolar ablation technique was used in the AF treatment for the patients. Following
the median sternotomy, bicaval cannulation and cardiopulmonary bypass were performed. A left
atriotomy was then carried out after inserting a cross-clamp. Afterwards, the process of RF
was performed using the Medtronic Cardioblate<sup>TM</sup> ablation system (Medtronic, Inc.,
Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA) composed of a power generator and an ablation clamp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). In this study, 25 W power and 5 ml/min
irrigation speed were used in the applications of unipolar RF with irrigation. The contact
surface was cooled by providing irrigation through the holes on the tip of the catheter, and
lesions were formed by reaching the effective ablation power in the deep tissues.</p><p><fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig 1</label><caption><p>Medtronic Cardioblate&#x02122; ablation system. A: Cardioblate Surgical ablation pens.
B: Cardioblate Clamp and Surgical Ablation Probe.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-31-04-0304-g01"/></fig>
</p><p>In patients in whom bipolar ablation was performed simultaneously with mitral valve
surgery, the system consisted of a power generator and ablation probe. The bipolar ablation
technique utilizing the same ablation system was used for the patients with bipolar RF. With
this system, the tip of the ablation clamp is atraumatic, and the target tissue is
stabilized between the two ends. The RF energy passes through this tissue. By providing
irrigation between the clamp and tissue surface simultaneously, the tissue is cooled which
maintains the tissue temperature between 45 and 55&#x000b0;C. Furthermore, the clamp emits a signal
indicating the formation of a transmural lesion by measuring the impedance between the two
electrodes. This process of generator ablation ends spontaneously through this mechanism.
Thus, a safe and controlled transmural ablation line is formed. This type of system can also
be used with offpump and minimally invasive techniques. By fluid irrigation through the
holes in the probe tip, the tissue was cooled and deeper lesions could be created. The
procedure was performed through left atrial incision, anterior to the right pulmonary veins,
following administration of cardioplegic arrest. After ablation was performed
circumferentially from within the left atrial appendage, it was closed with sutures from
inside. Then, an ablation line extending from left atrial appendage to left superior
pulmonary vein was created (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). Starting from
the incision made at the interatrial groove, the vicinity of right pulmonary veins was
isolated semi-circumferentially with the ablation pen. Left pulmonary veins were turned
around in a single circle. Then, another line, connecting two islands involving right and
left pulmonary veins was created. To avoid possible esophageal injury, this line was
positioned towards the left atrial roof as much as possible. Then, another ablation line,
connecting left pulmonary veins and posterior annulus of mitral valve was created. A line,
starting just from the midpoint of this line, was extended to the base of the atrium; with
this, it was aimed to avoid reentry waves, formed by coronary sinus between atria. While
ablation was done by encircling ostia of the right and left pulmonary veins, in order to
prevent cascade currents, the circular area was connected from inside. The auricle of LA was
sutured from inside.</p><p><fig id="f2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Ablation line: (A) unipolar, (B) bipolar.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-31-04-0304-g02"/></fig>
</p><p>In all patients, following cross-clamping, amiodarone infusion was started with a loading
dose of 600-800 mg/day. In every patient, temporary epicardial pacemaker wire was placed. In
patients entering AF following decannulation, internal electromechanical cardioversion was
performed. In every patient, amiodarone administration, which started during the operation,
continued postoperatively in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). In two patients in whom the
heart rate slowed down, amiodarone administration was terminated and temporary pacemaker
support was provided. In patients in whom PR interval was prolonged in electrocardiography
(ECG), the infusion dose of amiodarone was reduced. Patients who received inotropic agents
for any reason (even with low-dose or short-term) were considered as supported by
inotropes.</p><p>In all patients, amiodarone treatment was used for three months postoperatively. Following
surgery, with the aim of rhythm control, beta-adrenergic blockers (metoprolol) or digoxin
was added to the treatment of patients. The first evaluations of patients' rhythm status
were made by ECG during their ICU follow-up. Following discharge from the hospital, they
were followed-up by control examinations in the outpatient clinic. Patients were followed-up
by ECG in the first week and in the first month. In the 3<sup>rd</sup> month of the
postoperative period, besides echocardiography and ECG controls, 24-hour Holter ECG was also
performed. All antiarrhythmic agents were discontinued in patients who had sinus rhythm in
the control examination performed in the 3<sup>rd</sup> month.</p><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to determine the probability of survival, and
survival curves were compared using the log-rank test. All values were considered to be
statistically significant with a <italic>P</italic> value of less than 0.01.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Forty patients (15 males, 25 females; mean age 52.05&#x000b1;9.9 years; range 32-74)
underwent surgery for AF associated with mitral valvular disease. None of the patients
required permanent pacemaker. The average duration of perfusion and cross-clamping time were
111&#x000b1;10.2 min (range 54-159 min) and 81.3&#x000b1;19.6 min (range 33-139 min),
respectively. The average durations for ICU and hospital stay were 1.9&#x000b1;1.3 days
(range 1-11 days) and 9.6&#x000b1;2.5 days (range14-21 days), respectively.</p><p>Immediately after the operation, SR was restored in 85.3% of the patients
(<italic>P</italic>=0.50). Of those patients, many had recurrence of atrial
tachyarrhythmias within the first or second week after the Maze procedure. The New York
Heart Association (NYHA) functional class had improved by the last follow-up as compared
with the preoperative class in all patients (2.3&#x000b1;1.4,
<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001)</p><p>Following discharge from the hospital, patients' follow-up was performed as outpatient
clinic examinations and the average follow-up period of patients was 18&#x000b1;3 months. SR
was present in 28 (70%) patients and AF was identified in 12 (30%) patients in their
3<sup>rd</sup> month control examination. While the incidence of SR was 85.3% on the first
postoperative day, it was 80% during discharge and 71% in the 1<sup>st</sup> year follow-up
examination. In terms of functionality, NYHA values showed improvement in the postoperative
period. Since AF was identified in the 6<sup>th</sup> month follow-up in three patients,
electrical cardioversion was performed; in two patients, the rhythm returned to normal SR
and because AF persisted, one patient was discharged by planning outpatient treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In patients with chronic AF, the rate of returning to SR following mitral valve operation
is under 10%<sup>[<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. There has been a demand
for less invasive procedures, such as manipulation only in the pulmonary veins and
intraoperative ablation of atrial walls with alternative energy sources (cryoablation,
microwave, RF, laser, and ultrasound), and thoracoscopy procedures using RF and ultrasound
catheters from the epicardium in on-pump surgeries<sup>[<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. With ensuring SR and effective atrial contraction, myocardial
remodeling and heart failure due to tachycardia are prevented<sup>[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. Forlani et al.<sup>[<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> reported that ensuring SR increased the survival rate and decreased the
morbidities significantly in patients. For this reason, in patients having chronic AF
rhythm, if cardiac surgery is planned, addition of ablation treatment is suggested. On the
other hand, AF, which is present approximately in 5% of patients with coronary artery
disease, may continue following recovery of myocardial ischemia<sup>[<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. Since AF was shown to reduce the long-term survival rate
following coronary bypass procedures, surgical ablation is recommended in these
patients<sup>[<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>. AF ablation has shown a
rapid progress by utilization of various energy sources such as RF, microwave, laser,
ultrasound, and cryoablation. Nevertheless, the success rates vary between 76% and 92% in
surgical ablation methods excluding Maze<sup>[<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. There are many studies comparing the RF ablation treatment of AF with
patients in whom this procedure was not performed. Khargi et al.<sup>[<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> reported that at the end of the first year, 80% of patients
in whom RF was performed and 20% of patients in whom only mitral valve repair was performed
had SR. Melo et al.<sup>[<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> found that, in the
first month, SR was present in 7% of patients in whom RF ablation was not performed.
Jessurun et al.<sup>[<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> found sinus,
paroxysmal AF and chronic AF rhythms preoperatively in 162 patients, 71% of patients with
SR, 34% of patients with paroxysmal AF, and 4% of patients with chronic AF were in SR. Brick
&#x00026; Braile<sup>[<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> analyzing studies with
immediate results (n=5), the percentage of return to SR ranged from 73% to 96%, while those
with long-term results (n=20) (from 12 months on) ranged from 62% to 97.7%. Even with
postoperative antiarrhythmic drug treatment and electrical cardioversion, returning to SR
was found below 25% in the long-term follow-up<sup>[<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>. Early postoperative AF originates from delayed healing processes of
atrial lesions, inflammatory processes related to the procedure, and tiny macro re-entries,
which have responded perfectly to the antiarrhythmic treatment; for this reason, amiodarone
treatment with a dose of 200 mg/day is used during the first postoperative three months.</p><p>One of the most important purposes of returning the patients who were in AF preoperatively
to SR is to provide atrial contraction and atrioventricular electromechanical synchrony, and
additionally to reduce the risk of cardiac embolus. Waldo et al.<sup>[<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> showed that thromboembolic complications were met with less
frequency in AF patients who underwent Cox-Maze operation, when compared to the patients who
did not undergo this operation. In our study, also, no thromboembolic event was observed in
any of the patients.</p><p>It is suggested that the variations observed in results are related to patient
characteristics, ablation lines, and technical variables. In some patients, permanent
pacemaker may be required following ablation procedure. The frequency of requirement for
pacemaker generally varies between 5-10% in publications<sup>[<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>. Permanent pacemaker requirement is considered more frequent
in patients having large LA diameter and sick sinus syndrome in the preoperative period.
Postoperative drug treatments were mainly for rhythm control. We observed that in patients
that SR was acquired, life quality during their daily living improved with medical
treatment. The heart rates of patients having AF rhythm were observed to be under control
and episodes of disturbing tachycardia were not present.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, the early postoperative results of monopolar and bipolar RF ablation in
patients undergoing mitral valve surgery were successful in terms of providing atrial
transport function and it was observed that these procedures did not lead to additional
complications in the postoperative period. Therefore, we suggest that, in patients with AF
who are planned to undergo mitral valve surgery, RF ablation for AF is an effective and
reliable method for eliminating postoperative risks related to AF and for increasing
benefits of surgery.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="10%" span="1"/><col width="90%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors&#x02019; roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">A&#x000c7;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Conception and design study; realization of operations and/ or

for the surgical palliation in patients with functionally univentricular hearts.
This operation may or may not be preceded by a first stage palliation; however, it
is well known that this operation results in more efficient oxygenation than the
systemic pulmonary shunt with the advantage of avoiding the volume or pressure
overload of the single ventricle<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. There are two basic surgical techniques for creating a
cavopulmonary connection, the bidirectional superior cavopulmonary anastomosis
(bidirectional Glenn operation) and the Hemi-Fontan operation. In those patients who
have an interruption of the inferior vena cava with azygous or hemiazygous
continuation, a bilateral superior cavopulmonary connection operation is performed
with all the systemic venous return is directed to the pulmonary circulation except
for the portal venous return, this operation is called "Kawashima
operation"<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. However, the
development of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations and pulmonary arteriovenous
fistulae remains a potential complication following Kawashima operation<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. The patients who survive the SCPC operation are potential
candidates for the final palliative procedure: the Fontan operation<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>This study aimed to analyze the outcomes of SCPC operations in our center and to
identify factors affecting the survival and the progression to Fontan stage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Study Protocol and Population</title><p>Between 2005 and 2015, 161 patients with single ventricle physiology due to
variable congenital heart defects underwent SCPC in our center, Rajaie
Cardiovascular Medical and Research Center. In a retrospective study, the
outcomes of these patients concerning the clinical conditions, the survival
rates, and the progression to the final palliative stage were analyzed (Fontan
stage). Baseline demographics, preoperative, and intraoperative data were
collected from their charts. This study protocol was approved by the local
ethics committee in our institution.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients Follow-Up</title><p>The patients were regularly followed up in the outpatient clinic (1 week and 1
month after surgery, then every 3 months), with complete physical examination
and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). The follow-up data were obtained from
chart review, with special attention to survival and the completeness of the
final palliative stage.</p></sec><sec><title>Diagnostic Evaluations</title><p>The main diagnostic device was the TTE for both preoperative diagnosis and
postoperative follow-up. For further anatomical evaluation and especially for
measuring the mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP), cardiac catheterization was
performed preoperatively in 113 (70%) patients. For those patients who had not
undergone cardiac catheterization, the PAP was measured intraoperatively.
Additionally, computed tomographic angiography (CTA) was performed in 90 (55.9%)
patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Continuous variable were presented as mean &#x000b1; SD or median (interquartile
range) as appropriate. Qualitative variables were presented as frequency and
percentage. Mann Whitney U test was used to compare two groups' means and
<italic>P</italic> value &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 20 for windows (IBM Inc.,
Somers, NY, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Baseline Characteristics</title><p>Median age at SCPC operation was 5&#x000b1;4.9 years (range 9 months to 24.5

months to 10 years). Two (1.27%) late deaths occurred during the follow-up
period, both of them due to heart failure. The rate of freedom from mortality in
the follow-up period was 96.27%. Thirty-seven (23.57%) patients underwent total
cavopulmonary connection (TCPC), and 99 others (63%) are waiting for TCPC.
Thirteen (8.3%) patients were not candidates for TCPC due to high PAP (7
patients of whom three patients underwent takedown of the SCPC), poor
development of pulmonary arteries (three patients), ventricular dysfunction (two
patients), and viral hepatitis (one patient). No patient (especially from those
who underwent Kawashima operations) developed pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas
during the period of this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Takedown of the SCPC</title><p>Five patients underwent takedown of the SCPC (two on the same day of SCPC
operation of whom one died, and three during follow-up). The common denominator

patients underwent takedown of the SCPC of whom two at the same operation day and
three later during the follow-up period. The rate of exclusion from the TCPC was
8.3%. Statistical analysis revealed that elevated mPAP preoperatively and the prior
palliation with PAB were risk factors for both early mortality and takedown of the
SCPC; however, the age, the morphology of the single ventricle, and the type of SCPC
were not considered risk factors. The diagnosis of large multiple ventricular septal
defects or the upstairs downstairs ventricles with double outlet right ventricle or
double outlet left ventricle was associated with poor outcomes but due to the small
number of patients a statistically significant correlation could not be found.</p><p>Preoperative mPAP has been reported as a risk factor for death after the Glenn
procedure<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>, and mortality
in those receiving pulmonary artery banding was high<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>, and these findings were compatible with ours. From
our perspective it is essential to protect the pulmonary vascularity in patients
with single ventricle and unrestricted pulmonary blood flow since that the PAP
importantly affects the results of the surgical palliation in these patients.</p><p>There is no consensus regarding the ideal time for performing the SCPC in patients
with single ventricle<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> . Age
did not seem to influence the outcomes; however, we recommend surgery as earlier as
possible, although other logistic factors such as the availability of specialized
centers and physicians may affect the trend to perform the SCPC earlier.</p><p>The elimination of an accessory pulmonary blood flow (prior systemic pulmonary shunt)
at the time of SCPC operation did not affect the outcomes. On the other hand, some
studies suggested that this may be advantageous on a long-term basis<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations and pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas did not
develop during the follow-up period in this study in patients who underwent
Kawashima operation. In one study, this complication arose in 58% of the patients in
a median follow-up period of 5 years after Kawashima operation<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><sec><title>Limitation</title><p>The retrospective nature of this study is one of its main limitations, and the
short follow-up period in some patients was another considerable one.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The SCPC operation is an essential stage for the surgical palliation in patients with
univentricular heart and can be performed with a low rate of mortality and
morbidity; however, the elevated mPAP and the prior palliation by PAB remain an
important risk factors for poor outcomes.</p><table-wrap id="t5" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="50%" span="1"/><col width="50%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">AAD</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Substantial contributions to the conception or design

over and it's the most common heart valve disease. The mean survival of angina or heart
failure symptoms development is two years<sup>[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The aortic valve replacement significantly improves survival and it has been still
considered the treatment of choice. However, one third of the patients are considered not to
be candidates for standard surgical approaches, either for anatomical abnormalities,
previous thoracic surgery or chest radiation, comorbidities or overall frailty<sup>[<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In this scenario, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has assumed an important
role. It was initially designed for high risk patients, but now it can be used even in
moderate risk ones [Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score from 4% to 8%]<sup>[<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. Nevertheless, not all patients are candidates
for TAVI, some due aortic root or valve abnormalities, others because additional cardiac
procedures are needed (other valve replacement, coronary artery bypass grafting or repair of
the aortic root).</p><p>As alternatives to these difficulties, modern sutureless aortic prostheses have emerged.
Since now, the Perceval prosthesis (LivaNova Biomedica Cardio Srl, Sallugia, Italy) has been
considered the device that surgeons have more expertise. Its surgical implant allows
complete and safe annulus decalcification and can be performed through minimally invasive
procedures.</p><p>A special subgroup of patients who could benefit from this device is that with a very small
annulus, that could require aortic annular enlargement during aortic valve replacement or
the elderly patients with comorbidities and calcified aorta.</p><p>Considering that the Perceval sutureless aortic prosthesis is the most worldwide studied
and implanted valve, this report aims to publish the first Brazilian experience with this
device implantation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>A 73 years-old man was the first patient who underwent surgery. He had been diagnosed with
severe aortic stenosis one year ago and nowadays was presenting dyspnea New York Heart
Association (NYHA) class I-II. His preoperative echocardiography showed parameters
consistent with severe aortic stenosis (peak and mean gradient 81/41 mmHg, respectively;
peak velocity 4.5 m/s and valve area 0.7 cm<sup>2</sup>).</p><p>The second case was a 63 year-old man diagnosed with aortic stenosis two years ago and now
presenting dyspnea NYHA class II. His echocardiography were similar to the previous patient
(peak and mean gradient 129/75 mmHg, respectively; peak velocity 4.5,m/s and valve area 0.9
cm<sup>2</sup>).</p><p>The mean logistic European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE) and STS
score of these patients were 0.81% and 0.82%; 0.99% and 0.97%, respectively and their body
surface area were 1.99 and 1.71 m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>The surgery was performed in May 2016 at the Hospital de Cl&#x000ed;nicas de Porto Alegre,
Brazil, according to Dedeilias et al.<sup>[<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>
technique description. After a median full sternotomy, a routine cannulation to the
cardiopulmonary bypass was performed with aortic cannula at the distal part of the ascending
aorta and a two-stage venous cannula at the right atrium. The cross clamp was applied as
distal as possible in the ascending aorta and a transverse aortotomy was performed 1 cm
distal to the sinotubular junction (approximately 3.5 cm above the valve ring), followed by
direct cannulation of the coronary ostia and delivering of cold cardioplegia solution. After
the calcified native aortic valve was removed and the aortic annulus decalcified and
measured, 3 guiding sutures were positioned 2 mm below the nadir of the native leaflet
insertion line of each valve sinus. These sutures were passed through the corresponding
eyelets in the prosthetic inflow ring, as a reference for alignment of the inflow section of
the prosthesis with the insertion plane of the native leaflets.</p><p>The prosthesis valve was released into two phases: first, the inflow section of the valve,
followed by the opening of the outflow part, then a post-implant dilatation was performed
with a balloon catheter at pressures of 4 atm for 30 seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). Once the prosthesis was completely deployed, the guiding sutures were
removed.</p><p><fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Perceval sutureless aortic prosthesis deployed.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-31-04-0334-g01"/></fig></p><p>Three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography performed by experienced
echocardiographer was available during all the procedures.</p><p>In order to allow expansion and anchorage of the device and reduce migration risk, the
ratio between the sinotubular junction diameter and the aortic valve annulus couldn't exceed
1.3 - prerequisite obtained in both cases (1.0 e 1.2).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The procedures were performed with participation of a proctor of the University of Graz in
Austria. The cardiopulmonary bypass times were 47 and 38 minutes and the cross-clamp times
were 38 and 30 minutes. Mechanical ventilation weaning, postoperative bleeding control and
intensive care unit stay were performed according to the routine of the cardiovascular
surgery postoperative care.</p><p>Postoperative echocardiography showed mean gradients of the 7 and 8 mmHg and there was no
paravalvular leak.</p><p>Both patients had favorable postoperative clinical course. None of them had any major
complication nor atrioventricular block determining need of pacemaker implant. They were
discharged on the tenth day after surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The constant search for less invasive surgery techniques is extremely relevant for modern
cardiovascular surgery. Once the aortic stenosis is the most frequent valvular disease,
keeping pace with advances in its surgical treatment maintains a surgery group competitive
and provides an opportunity for patients to have access to the best treatments
available.</p><p>Even though worldwide several prospective studies and systematic reviews have demonstrated
safety and excellent hemodynamic results with the Perceval sutureless bioprosthesis, this
device had not been used in Brazil yet. It's a self-expanding bovine bioprosthesis valve
mounted in a Nitinol stent and designed to preserve aortic sinuses and sinotubular junction
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p><fig id="f2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Perceval structure (courtesy LivaNova).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-31-04-0334-g02"/></fig></p><p>When we compare the aortic valve replacement using sutureless prosthesis with the
conventional technique, we realize not only aortic cross-clamp, cardiopulmonary bypass and
surgery times significantly shorter, but also less blood transfusion required, lower
intubation time, shorter intensive care unit stay, hospital stay and lower incidence of
postoperative atrial fibrillation and respiratory insufficiency. This lower rate of
postoperative complications resulted in reduced resource consumption in the sutureless group
with a total cost saving of approximately 25%<sup>[<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that Brazil already has experimental studies in animal models in
order to develop a similar device (Inovare Alpha - Braile Biom&#x000e9;dica, S&#x000e3;o
Jos&#x000e9; do Rio Preto, SP, Brazil). The results were published in 2015 by Gomes et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> and demonstrated excellent clamp
time (mean of 7 min, ranging from 6 to 10 minutes) and no paravalvular leak after the
prosthesis implant. It is now ongoing in Brazil a trial comparing Alpha with conventional
aortic valve replacement in patients with combined procedures. There is another sutureless
valve (Intuity &#x02013; Edwards Lifesciences Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA) that has just been
approved some months ago for clinical use in Brazil. This device needs 3 sutures to be tight
at the nadir of each cusp.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>We reported the first national experience with the Perceval sutureless aortic prosthesis.
This device proved safety and excellent hemodynamic results. In our two cases we observed a
reduction of mean gradients higher than would be expected from conventional valve
replacement.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="10%" span="1"/><col width="90%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors&#x02019; roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">APT</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Conception and design study; realization of operations and/or trials;

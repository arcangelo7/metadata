Health Organization (WHO), 17.5 million people die each year from CVD, with 75% of
these deaths occurring in low and middle income countries<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. Coronary artery bypass
grafting (CABG) aims to increase the life expectancy of patients with improved
quality of life, relief of myocardial ischemia symptoms, and improvement of
ventricular function<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>, but there are still high rates of
complications<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Aerobic exercise training shows a cardiovascular, skeletal muscle, endurance,
pulmonary function, inflammatory profile, depression and stress symptoms, and
quality of life improvement, as well as improving significant outcomes such as
mortality<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. Recent systematic reviews
have shown that exercise training programs are capable of reducing mortality,
reducing hospitalizations, and improving the quality of life of patients with
coronary artery disease, chronic heart failure (CHF) and patients who have undergone
CABG<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>For the treatment of patients with poor inspiratory muscle performance, with symptoms
of dyspnea, low exercise tolerance, and low functional status<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>, inspiratory muscle
training (IMT) is presented as a strategy of great value. In patients with CHF, low
to moderate intensity IMT (maximum 30% of the maximal inspiratory pressure) led to a
significant improvement in peak oxygen consumption (PeakVO<sub>2</sub>), functional
capacity, and respiratory muscle strength, in addition to improving quality of
life<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>High-intensity IMT [60% or more of the maximal inspiratory pressure
(MIP)] has already been investigated, as in randomized clinical trials which
showed that the use of this modality for four weeks in patients with CHF
significantly improved respiratory muscle strength and percentage variation of
resistance in these patients<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>. When associated with aerobic exercise, high-intensity
IMT presented significant improvement in MIP, quality of life, dyspnea, and
C-reactive protein<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The effects of aerobic exercise and IMT on improved physical and clinical conditions
of CVD patients are well established, however, no study has tested the additional
effects of IMT associated with aerobic exercise in an attempt to minimize the side
effects of cardiac surgery. Therefore, the objective of this study was to verify the
effects of high-intensity IMT associated with aerobic exercise in functional
capacity, respiratory muscle strength, peripheral muscle strength and quality of
life of patients who underwent CABG.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Design and Participants</title><p>This study was a randomized controlled clinical trial conducted between September
2015 and December 2016. Adults who underwent CABG were randomly assigned to
perform aerobic exercise (GAE) or to perform aerobic exercise associated with
high-intensity IMT (GAE+IMT) over a period of 3 months. Eligible participants
were randomized using a computer-generated list of random numbers that had been
prepared using a randomization model blocked by a researcher without involvement
in the study. The assignment sequence was hidden in sealed, opaque, and
sequentially numbered envelopes. After completing the baseline assessments, the
lead investigator opened the appropriate envelope and assigned the participants
to the group.</p><p>The sample consisted of patients in the postoperative period of elective CABG at
the Institute of Cardiology of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil. Patients
between the fourteenth and the thirtieth postoperative day, aged 30 to 70 years,
were referred for cardiac rehabilitation with medical authorization. Patients
with decompensated CHF and presence of comorbidities, such as: unstable angina;
moderate to severe respiratory disease; active infectious disease or febrile
condition; disabling peripheral vascular disease; unstable ventricular
arrhythmia and use of cardiac pacing were excluded. The sample size was
calculated based on the study by Ghashghaei et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>, which presented a
variation of 98.15 meters in six-minute walk distance (6MWD) teste between
groups with standard deviation of 87.89 meters and 66.75 meters with a power of
80% and level of significance of 5%. The calculated value included 10 patients
in each group.</p><p>The entire intervention protocol was performed at the Cardiopulmonary and
Metabolic Rehabilitation Center of the Institute of Cardiology of Rio Grande do
Sul, in Porto Alegre, Brazil. Trained physiotherapists applied the protocols and
the physiotherapists responsible for assessing the outcomes were unaware of the
intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical Considerations</title><p>This study was approved by the ethics and research committee of the Institute of
Cardiology of Rio Grande do Sul, through protocol number 1.241.143 and was
registered at Clinical Trials through number NCT02742350. All participants
signed the informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedures</title><p>Patients allocated to the GAE+IMT performed a protocol of high-intensity IMT
followed by an aerobic exercise protocol. The high-intensity IMT protocol was
performed with a linear pressure loading device (POWERbreathe Plus
Resistance(r), SP, Brazil). IMT was performed for 12 weeks and the protocol
consisted of five sets with 10 repetitions each until the 8<sup>th</sup> week
and progression of the number of sets (1 per week) and repetitions (10 to 12)
from the 8<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> week. The overload was adjusted
weekly by a revaluation of MIP starting with 50% of the MIP during the first two
weeks, 60% of the MIP in the third and fourth weeks, 70% of the MIP in the fifth
and sixth weeks, and 80% MIP from the seventh week until the end of the
protocol.</p><p>The aerobic exercise protocol was performed for 12 weeks and divided into 3
phases: Phase 1 - 12 sessions with 50% to 60% of reserve PeakHR (maximal heart
rate); Phase 2 - 12 sessions with 60% to 70% of the reserve PeakHR, and Phase 3
- 12 sessions with 70% to 80% of the reserve PeakHR. Exercise prescription was
given through the ergometric test, where PeakHR and maximum oxygen consumption
(PeakVO<sub>2</sub>) through repetitive effort with the Bruce protocol were
obtained. The aerobic training had an average duration of 40 minutes.</p><p>Patients allocated to the GAE performed the same aerobic exercise protocol
performed in the GAE+IMT, during the same 12 weeks. These patients did not
perform the high-intensity IMT protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>The evaluations were performed pre-intervention, at the 12<sup>th</sup>,
24<sup>th</sup>, and 36<sup>th</sup> session. Except for the quality of life
and ergometric test that were evaluated only pre and post-intervention.</p><p>Functional capacity was the primary outcome assessed through the 6MWD, which was
performed according to the guidelines proposed by the American Thoracic
Society<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>. The patients made their way down a thirty-meter
corridor delimited by cones, encouraged by the evaluator every minute. Another
functional capacity assessment was evaluated by the indirect measurement of
PeakVO<sub>2</sub> through the pre and post-intervention by ergometric
test.</p><p>The circuit for the measurement of respiratory muscular strength, MIP and maximal
expiratory pressure (MEP) was composed of an MVD 300 digital manometer
(Microhard System, Globalmed, Porto Alegre, Brazil). MIP was measured from
residual volume and MEP from total lung capacity<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>To evaluate the peripheral muscular strength, the sitting-rising test (SRT) was
performed with the patient sitting in a 45 cm high chair, feet apart and
supported on the floor with arms crossed against the chest. The patient was
encouraged to stand up and return to a sitting position as many times as
possible in 30 seconds, with the maximum number of repetitions
recorded<sup>[<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In order to evaluate the impact of modifying some daily habits on quality of life
and health maintenance, the patients participating in the study from both groups
were invited to fill out a questionnaire on quality of life at the time of
inclusion in the study and at the end of the study. The Brazilian Version of the
Quality of Life Questionnaire - SF-36 was used.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Descriptive data are presented as mean and standard error (SE). Variations
between interventions are reported as mean differences with 95% confidence
intervals (95% CI). The distribution of variables was tested by Shapiro-Wilk
normality test. In the statistical analysis, the Student's t-test was applied to
compare means or two repeated measures. Effects of interventions were compared
by generalized estimating equation model (group, time, and interaction),
followed by Bonferroni <italic>post-hoc</italic> test. The categorical variables
were evaluated by Fisher's exact test, and are expressed as proportions. The
statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS 24, graphics were made by
Graphpad Prism 5, and the level of significance was set at 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The participant's flow through the study is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>. A total of 42 potential volunteers were screened. 24
participants meeting the eligibility criteria were randomized to the GAE+IMT (n=13)
and the GAE (n=11), and 6 did not finish the protocol. In the GAE+IMT: one patient
was excluded due to discovery of peripheral arterial disease; one patient by blood
glucose test, and two patients withdrew from the protocol. Two patients from the GAE
gave up the protocol because of problems with work. The sample was considered
homogeneous as the basic characteristics. Clinical characteristics were presented in

interaction of MIP between moments 0 and 36 in both groups. Although the GAE + IMT
group started lower, it reached higher values in manovacuometry. It is important to
note that the difference between pre and post in the groups was approximately 20% in
the GAE and 40% in the GAE+IMT and 20% between the groups. These values, when
interpreted clinically, represent a significant gain and an additional effect of IMT

high-intensity IMT with aerobic exercise in patients who underwent CABG. The main
findings of this study were a demonstration that there was no additional increase of
the high-intensity IMT at the main endpoint, no test of the patients without a 6MWD
and also in the secondary outcomes: Peak VO<sub>2</sub>, MEP, SRT and quality of
life. However, there was a significant MIP interaction, showing additional benefit
for the group that performed IMT.</p><p>These results are at odds with some studies in other populations. The use of IMT with
low loads was effective in respiratory muscle strength, functional capacity, and
quality of life in a systematic review of patients with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease<sup>[<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>. In a systematic review of patients with CHF, IMT was
able to improve Peak VO<sub>2</sub>, 6MWD, and MIP<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>.
In CABG patients, IMT associated with aerobic exercise improved pre and
post-intervention variation in MIP, Peak VO<sub>2</sub>, and quality of
life<sup>[<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>.
The only study that involved the interaction of high-intensity IMT with aerobic
exercise was performed in patients with CHF and found positive results in the
improvement of the quality of life, but the results of the MIP were similar to ours,
showing that there was only difference over time, without difference between the
groups<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The disagreement in the results can be justified by the difference in the number of
cases, by the severity of the disease and by the type of intervention performed,
since the greatest results are demonstrated in studies involving IMT alone without
association with other interventions. The systematic review by Montemezzo et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>
shows that the effect of IMT on 6MWD was only significant when training was
performed on patients with previous inspiratory muscle weakness, which did not
characterize the sample of this study.</p><p>The improvement in MIP observed in this study is justified by the principles of
training: overload, in which the muscle must be requested at levels higher than
usual so that muscle cells increase in size or functional capacity and specificity,
where the training should be directed specifically to the muscle
properties<sup>[<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup>. Many studies corroborate this finding both in the use
of low-load IMT as in the studies of Gosselink et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>, with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, or of Hermes et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>, postoperative node of CABG, or in the systematic
reviews of patients with CHF of Montemezzo et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>, Plentz et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>, and Smart et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>, as
well as in high-intensity use observed in the study by Adamopoulos et
al.<sup>16</sup>.</p><p>It is important to highlight that the groups obtained significant improvements in all
the outcomes studied, showing that both trainings are alternatives that can be used
to recover patients who underwent CABG. However, the use of technology without
additional gains makes intervention more costly to the patient and health systems,
and should be used with caution.</p><sec><title>Limitation</title><p>The study presents some limitations that could have improved the effect of the
intervention. Although the sample number is in accordance with a previous
statistical calculation, the increase in the number of the sample could increase
the power of the results. In addition, there was a lack of blinding of
therapists and patients as well as the lack of a non-intervention group in order
to compare one training with another. That being said, new studies can be
carried out in an attempt to improve the hypothesis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This was the first study to associate the use of high-intensity IMT with aerobic
exercise in the postoperative period of CABG. There was an improvement of all
outcomes in both groups, but high-intensity IMT was not able to provide additional
benefit in most of the outcomes, being observed only in inspiratory muscle strength.
Therefore, the use of this combination should be used with caution so as to not
generate higher costs in the rehabilitation process of these patients.</p><table-wrap id="t5" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="5%" span="1"/><col width="95%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">APM</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Substantial contributions to the

Timely recognition and referral are essential for treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Aim</title><p>To examine the ability of receptionists in general practices to recognise symptoms of stroke and direct patients to emergency care.</p></sec><sec><title>Design and setting</title><p>Unannounced simulated patient telephone calls and prospective cross-sectional survey study in general practices in the Birmingham and Solihull area.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p>A total of 52 general practices participated in a total of 520 simulated telephone calls, with 183 receptionists completing questionnaires. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine likelihood of referral for immediate care by ease of vignette recognition and number of common stroke symptoms present.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>General practice receptionists correctly referred 69% of simulated calls for immediate care. Calls classed as &#x02018;difficult&#x02019; to recognise were less likely to be immediately referred. Compared with &#x02018;easy&#x02019; calls: &#x02018;difficult&#x02019; calls odds ratio (OR) 0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.08 to 0.26; &#x02018;moderate&#x02019; calls OR 0.55, 95% CI = 0.32 to 0.92. Similarly, calls including one or two &#x02018;FAST&#x02019; symptoms were less likely to be referred immediately (compared with three FAST symptoms: one symptom OR 0.30, 95% CI = 0.13 to 0.72; two symptoms OR 0.35, 95% CI = 0.15 to 0.83).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>General practice receptionists refer patients with stroke for immediate care when they present with several symptoms; however, they are less likely to refer patients presenting with only one symptom or less common symptoms of stroke. Optimum management of acute stroke in primary care requires interventions that improve receptionists&#x02019; knowledge of lesser-known stroke symptoms.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>general practice</kwd><kwd>health services administration</kwd><kwd>medical receptionists</kwd><kwd>patient simulation</kwd><kwd>questionnaires</kwd><kwd>stroke</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide with an estimated 5.7 million deaths and approximately 50 million disability-adjusted life years lost every year.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The burden of stroke can be reduced with thrombolysis, but this is time limited and can only be administered in a specialist setting.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Thus, timely recognition and referral are essential to ensure patients with stroke receive the best possible care.</p><p>The GP is the first point of contact for between 22% and 56% of patients with acute stroke<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> or transient ischaemic attack,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> but only 55&#x02013;71% of these are correctly referred on to the emergency services for immediate care.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Few studies have examined the mechanisms behind the referral process, although one study found that in cases where the GP answered the phone, patients were correctly referred to the emergency services.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> In most cases, it is the general practice receptionist who will answer a call directed to an individual&#x02019;s GP and little is known about their ability to correctly recognise and refer patients with stroke.</p><p>Receptionists in this situation must determine the urgency of a patient&#x02019;s condition and when (or if) an appointment should be made,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> but, often, their training is minimal.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> It is hypothesised that one source of delay to patients accessing acute stroke care is failure by receptionists to recognise symptoms of stroke and therefore to treat acute stroke patients as a medical emergency.

Individual receptionist knowledge of stroke symptoms was examined using questionnaires.</p></sec><sec><title>Population</title><p>All general practices within the Birmingham and Solihull NHS Primary Care Providers (UK) area were invited to participate in the study via a combination of postal, email, and telephone invitations. Practice level consent was gained from a lead GP and the practice manager (or equivalent) at each practice. Receptionists were informed that a study was ongoing, but were not told about the nature of the simulated calls or when they would occur. All receptionists at participating practices were invited to complete a questionnaire. Practices were reimbursed a nominal amount to cover the additional work required to participate in the study. Detailed methods of the study are reported elsewhere.<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><boxed-text position="float"><sec><title>How this fits in</title><p>Many patients with acute stroke contact their GP initially, but not all are correctly referred to the emergency services. To date, little is known about general practice receptionists&#x02019; ability to correctly recognise stroke. The present study found that receptionists have good knowledge of the common symptoms of stroke. However, further consideration of a receptionist&#x02019;s place at the centre of emergency primary care responses might lead to improved outcome.</p></sec></boxed-text></sec><sec><title>Unannounced simulated patient telephone calls</title><p>Five trained medical role players, with past experience working as simulated patients/relatives, made 10 separate calls to each participating practice. Each practice received calls from a range of role players including the same 10 different vignettes designed to include a range of stroke presentations (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1">Box 1</xref>). Two callers specifically stated that they thought they were having a stroke, and three reported a single symptom, in keeping with stroke calls typically made to the emergency medical services (EMS).<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Vignettes were categorised &#x02018;easy&#x02019;, &#x02018;moderate&#x02019; and &#x02018;difficult&#x02019; to recognise, by an expert panel consisting of five clinicians, six receptionists (not otherwise involved in the study), and two stroke survivors.

Only 29% (53/183) of receptionists reported a common symptom of posterior stroke (vomiting, visual disturbance, or vertigo), with 19% (34/183) naming visual problems and 15% (28/183) vertigo, but only 2% (4/183) identifying vomiting as a symptom. Other less specific potential stroke symptoms such as numbness, confusion, or headache, and loss of coordination were reported by 50% (91/183) of receptionists. One or more incorrect symptoms, such as chest or limb pain, were reported by 40% (74/183) of receptionists, however, and 15% (27/183) mentioned ambiguous symptoms.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Summary</title><p>The present study found that general practice receptionists did not always direct patients calling with potential symptoms of stroke to immediate medical advice or the EMS, particularly when the symptoms were not clear cut. They had good knowledge of common anterior circulation symptoms of stroke, and performed well when patients presented with three such symptoms (facial asymmetry, slurred speech, and arm weakness). However, presentations with fewer symptoms or those related to posterior circulation stroke were more likely to elicit a delaying response. This study used a range of scenarios, but given that only 3% of patients calling the EMS with acute stroke mention more than one symptom, there appears to be a need for new interventions to assist receptionists to recognise possible stroke. This is particularly the case in the recognition of possible posterior circulation stroke and to reinforce the need for urgent action, even when only one symptom is present.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> This might include training aimed at improving receptionists&#x02019; responses to stroke as part of a range of medical emergencies. Only 14% of receptionists in the current study reported receiving training related to stroke. In the UK there are no national educational structures for GP receptionists. Associated bodies can provide medical administration training; however, it is not compulsory and its scope in relation to emergency response is limited.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The simulated calls used here allowed examination of the actual response to patients presenting with stroke, rather than planned responses. Receptionists were informed about the nature of the study, but they were not informed that it was about stroke and calls were distributed over several months to minimise the possibility of detection. Role players were advised to be consistent in what they said, the tone of their voice, and the representation of urgency across each specific vignette. Despite this it is possible that differences in sense of urgency might have influenced receptionist response, regardless of stroke knowledge.<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> However, this probably reflects daily practices in that the extent to which a patient is forceful, informed, or anxious could similarly influence the urgency of receptionist response. Ideally, the study would have included a sample of 60 practices, but only 52 practices had calls conducted; however, as 69% of calls were correctly immediately referred for treatment, rather than the conservative sample size calculation estimate of 50%, this smaller sample size has not affected the expected accuracy level of &#x000b1;4%.</p><p>Questionnaire and simulated call data were not directly comparable as it is not known who answered the telephone during each call. The questionnaire response rate was 54% which could have introduced a response bias, but the demographics of responders were broadly in line with what was expected of participating receptionists. Questionnaires were distributed after calls were completed so it is possible that involvement in a simulated call may have influenced receptionist responses to these questionnaires.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with existing literature</title><p>Few studies have reported how receptionists respond when patients present with symptoms of stroke.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> In the present study, a lower proportion (61%) of stroke calls were referred to the EMS for immediate care than in a small US study in which 71% of primary care office staff called an ambulance.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Similarly, 22% of healthline operators (hospital main phone line operators) reacting to a stroke scenario recommended that patients call their GP rather than the emergency services.<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Differences between studies are to be expected given likely variation in call content.</p><p>Receptionists performed better than members of the public in terms of stroke symptom knowledge, with the public&#x02019;s ability to name one symptom in an open-ended question ranging from 25&#x02013;72%, compared with 96% in the present study.<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> This is comparable with previous work in the US, where 95% of receptionists and 76% of healthline operators (hospital main phone line operators) could name at least one symptom of stroke.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>Previous general practice studies have used simulated calls.<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> This study is novel as it is one of few studies with focus on GP receptionists and, to the authors&#x02019; knowledge, is the first to examine receptionists&#x02019; handling of emergency calls in this way.<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The use of human simulation as a research methodology is established, but not prolific, so this study contributes meaningfully to the evidence base for medical education. The use of simulated (&#x02018;dummy&#x02019;) patient records for each caller was designed to improve the face validity of calls and reduce detection. To the authors&#x02019; knowledge, only one simulated call was recognised. The use of dummy records has not been reported elsewhere in primary care and despite initial operational difficulties was implemented successfully.<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><p>Receptionists are likely to experience a wide range of emergency situations and it is important to note that increasing receptionists&#x02019; ability to recognise stroke may be only one of a number of skills needed in relation to responding to serious acute illnesses. In Australia, work is ongoing to assess how receptionists prioritise a range of situations using a decision-making tool.<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Implications for research and practice</title><p>The present study found that despite generally good receptionist knowledge of stroke, there was reduced recognition of the symptoms common to posterior circulation stroke, and misinterpretation of some symptoms which were not typical of acute stroke. Previous studies have suggested that slower recognition of posterior circulation strokes in the emergency department could delay patient treatment in hospital.<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Indeed, the FAST test, commonly used by EMS staff in a pre-hospital setting, is less sensitive to posterior strokes, with up to 40% being classed as false negatives.<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> This issue is likely to be compounded in primary care as patients with posterior circulation stroke are less likely to recognise their symptoms as urgent (because of the lack of media coverage highlighting these symptoms of stroke, that is, the Act FAST Campaign<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), and therefore are more likely to initially present to non-emergency services.</p><p>The present study also found that simulated patients presenting with one or two stroke symptoms were less likely to be referred for immediate care than patients presenting with three. This perhaps reflects receptionist uncertainty about the presenting condition and increased confidence in their ability to recognise stroke where more than one symptom is present. Given the important role of receptionists in the referral of patients with stroke, interventions that improve receptionist knowledge of lesser known stroke symptoms and the need to refer patients to the EMS immediately appear relevant. Increasing receptionists&#x02019; recognition of stroke may have the unintended consequence of more stroke &#x02018;mimic&#x02019; patients being referred for immediate care. However, recent modelling work has suggested that successfully training receptionists to refer patients for immediate care could increase thrombolysis rates by up to 16%, resulting in a greater number of patients enjoying a better quality of life after stroke and reducing resultant disability.<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Understanding the optimum method of achieving such changes warrants further investigation.</p><p>Receptionists have good knowledge of common stroke symptoms and are likely to refer patients presenting with these for immediate care. However, around 30% of calls made in this study were not treated as an emergency suggesting that there is still room for improvement in knowledge and behaviour. GPs and policymakers should consider the development of interventions to improve recognition of the less common symptoms of stroke, to ensure that these patients are not delayed in accessing time-dependent treatment in secondary care. Training sessions and e-learning modules could go some way to fulfilling this need.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>Participating practices, receptionists, and pilot practices.

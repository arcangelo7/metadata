The <italic>Bulletin </italic>is fully open-access and charges no author fees. </p><p>The <italic>Bulletin</italic> welcomes a variety of unsolicited manuscripts (see below, 1.1.1.). These are initially screened in house for originality, relevance to an international public health audience and scientific rigour. If they pass the initial screening, they are sent to peer reviewers whose opinions are taken into account by the journal&#x02019;s editorial advisers when they decide whether to accept a manuscript for publication. Accepted papers are subject to editorial revision, which may involve substantive changes, shortening or restructuring the text and deleting superfluous tables and figures. The word limits given for each type of contribution do not include the abstract (where applicable), tables, boxes, figures and references or appendices, if any. The principal types of manuscripts are outlined below.</p><sec id="sec1.1.1"><label>1.1.1.</label><title>Unsolicited manuscripts</title><p>We welcome unsolicited submissions to the Research, Systematic reviews, Policy&#x000a0;&#x00026; practice, Lessons from the field and Perspectives sections of the <italic>Bulletin</italic>.

If an author has several affiliations, only the most important one should be provided. The criteria for authorship described in the <italic>ICMJE recommendations</italic> (see above, 2.2) must be rigorously observed. Each author should have participated sufficiently in the work being reported to take public responsibility for the paper&#x02019;s content and should describe in detail on the online submission system (not within the manuscript itself) his or her particular contribution. The <italic>Bulletin</italic> encourages submissions from authors in low- and middle-income countries, and in line with this policy at least one author should have a professional affiliation in the country where the study was conducted.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><label>2.5</label><title>Licence for publication</title><p>The <italic>Bulletin</italic> is a fully open-access journal and charges no author fees.

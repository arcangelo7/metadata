In the intramembranous bone formation route, bone develops directly from sheets of mesenchymal connective tissue, which is formed by mesenchymal cells from the cranial neural crest, sclerotomes, and lateral plate mesoderm that migrate and proliferate. In the endochondral bone formation route, condensation of mesenchymal progenitor cells and their subsequent differentiation into chondrocytes lead to the establishment of cartilage, which is subsequently replaced by trabecular bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> There are two centers of ossification for endochondral ossification&#x02014;a primary and a secondary center. The primary ossification center (POC) usually appears in the diaphysis of the long bones or in the body of the irregular bones during embryonic development, while the secondary ossification center (SOC) occurs in the epiphysis of long bones at the time of birth in mammals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> Endochondral ossification at the POC is tightly regulated by a number of growth factors (PTHrP, Ihh, IGF-I, BMP/TGF&#x003b2;, Wnt, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)) and transcription factors (Sox9, Runx2, Osterix (Osx), and &#x003b2;-catenin).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> Dysregulation in the production and/or actions of any of the factors that regulate endochondral ossification can result in skeletal diseases, including chondrodysplasias and osteoarthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> While the processes leading to POC formation have been well established, signaling pathways that stimulate SOC formation are not well understood.</p><p id="Par3">In our previous studies on the mechanisms for the thyroid hormone effect on bone formation, we focused on SOCs since the time of appearance of SOCs in some bones in several species, including mice, rats, and humans coincides with the time when peak levels of thyroid hormone are attained.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> In humans, the identification of proximal humeral epiphyseal ossification centers occurred around a gestational age of 38 weeks, which coincided with the attainment of peak levels of thyroid hormone (36&#x02013;40 weeks). In rodents, the peak levels of thyroid hormone are attained at week 2 when SOC formation of the distal femur and proximal tibia also takes place. By using mouse models that are deficient in thyroid hormone and/or growth hormone, we found that endochondral ossification of the proximal tibia SOC is severely compromised due to thyroid hormone deficiency, and that thyroid hormone replacement for 10 days completely rescued this phenotype.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> However, SOCs in different bones are known to appear at different times in both humans and mice. These temporal association studies suggest that thyroid hormone is permissive for normal SOC formation and that lack of thyroid hormone results in delayed SOC formation in certain long bones.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> We also examined the expression levels of key regulators responsible for chondrocyte/osteoblast differentiation in the epiphyses by real-time PCR and found that <italic>Osx</italic> expression is severely compromised in the epiphyses of thyroid hormone-deficient mice at P10 when serum levels of thyroid hormone peak in mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> This reduced <italic>Osx</italic> mRNA level in hypothyroid <italic>Tshr</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice is completely rescued by treatment of thyroid hormone-deficient mice with replacement doses of T3/T4 for 5 days. We further showed that thyroid hormone effects on <italic>Osx</italic> expression were mediated via activation of thyroid hormone receptor &#x003b2;1 signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup></p><p id="Par4">OSX was initially identified as an osteoblast-specific transcription factor, and mice with total knockout of <italic>Osx</italic> function failed to form bone and died immediately after birth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> In recent studies, however, we and others have shown that <italic>Osx</italic> is also expressed in chondrocytes and contributes to skeletal development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> Based on the relative importance of OSX in osteoblast development and bone formation and our findings that OSX expression is severely compromised in the chondrocytes of thyroid hormone-deficient mice during secondary ossification, we proposed the hypothesis that OSX expressed in chondrocytes contributes to the thyroid hormone effects on chondrocyte differentiation and osteoblast development during postnatal growth. To test this hypothesis, we generated <italic>Osx</italic>-floxed mice with or without the <italic>Col2a1-Cre-ERT2</italic> transgene. We treated these mice with a single injection of tamoxifen at P3 to induce inactivation of the <italic>Osx</italic> gene in epiphyseal chondrocytes prior to evaluation of chondrocyte and osteoblast formation and trabecular bone formation in the epiphysis at 3 weeks of age.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Conditional knockout of <italic>Osx</italic> expression in chondrocytes reduces the trabecular bone volume in the epiphysis</title><p id="Par5">To examine whether <italic>Osx</italic> expressed in chondrocytes mediates trabecular bone formation in the epiphysis, we generated mice with postnatal inactivation of the <italic>Osx</italic> gene in epiphyseal chondrocytes by breeding <italic>Osx</italic>-floxed mice with transgenic <italic>Col2&#x003b1;1-Cre-ERT2</italic> mice. <italic>Cre</italic>-negative, <italic>Osx</italic>-floxed control mice (WT) and <italic>Cre</italic>-positive, <italic>Osx</italic>-floxed homozygous mice (cKO) were given a single injection of tamoxifen at P3 to induce conditional knockout (cKO) of the <italic>Osx</italic> gene in chondrocytes.

However, we cannot exclude the possibility of involvement of Osx-positive-chondrocyte-derived factors in regulating osteoblast differentiation in an autocrine or paracrine manner. In this regard, a recent study demonstrated that Osx-positive hypertrophic chondrocyte-derived VEGF might regulate angiogenesis, osteoblast differentiation, and bone formation during embryonic development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup></p><p id="Par13">OSX was initially identified as an osteoblast-specific transcription factor that activates a repertoire of genes during differentiation of preosteoblasts into mature osteoblasts and osteocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> In <italic>Osx</italic> null mutant mice, no endochondral or intramembranous bone formation occurred due to the arrest in osteoblast differentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> Since OSX was also known to be expressed, albeit at lower levels, in prehypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> we and others examined the role of OSX expressed in chondrocytes by conditional disruption of the <italic>Osx</italic> gene in Col2&#x003b1;1-expressing chondrocytes. Surprisingly, cKO of <italic>Osx</italic> in chondrocytes using Col2&#x003b1;1-Cre resulted in postnatal lethality because of respiratory insufficiency; the cKO embryos exhibited defective chondrocyte differentiation and bone formation. Heterozygous cKO mice also had skeletal defects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> Body length and areal BMD of the total body, femur, and tibia were significantly reduced in mice with conditional disruption of one allele of <italic>Osx</italic> in chondrocytes.

To address this prediction, we generated mice with postnatal inactivation of the <italic>Osx</italic> gene in epiphyseal chondrocytes by breeding <italic>Osx</italic>-floxed mice with transgenic <italic>Cre-ERT2</italic> mice in which tamoxifen-activatable Cre expression is under the control of the <italic>Col2&#x003b1;1</italic> promoter. Our data show that postnatal inactivation of <italic>Osx</italic> in chondrocytes via a single injection of tamoxifen at P3 resulted in reduced endochondral ossification. The trabecular bone mass of tibial epiphyses analyzed by &#x000b5;CT was reduced by 24% in the <italic>Osx</italic> cKO compared with control mice, which was caused by significant reductions in Tb. N and thickness and an increase in Tb. Sp. Our histological and IHC analyses reveal that the reduced trabecular bone in the tibial epiphyses of <italic>Osx</italic> cKO mice is due to delayed cartilage-to-bone conversion caused by a delay in the development of hypertrophic chondrocytes and their conversion to osteoblasts. Consistent with a role for OSX in transdifferentiation of chondrocytes into osteoblasts, we found that overexpression of OSX caused a robust increase in the expression of osteoblast-specific markers (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). In addition, we found that knockdown of OSX in ATDC5 chondrocytes impaired expression of osteoblast markers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> These and our recently published data on the lineage mapping of Col2&#x003b1;1-expressing chondrocytes during epiphyseal bone formation provide direct evidence for a role for OSX expressed in chondrocytes in endochondral ossification of epiphyses via a mechanism involving chondrocyte-to-osteoblast transdifferentiation.</p><p id="Par14">In terms of the question of why the trabecular bone phenotype of mice with postnatal inactivation of the <italic>Osx</italic> gene in chondrocytes is much less severe in this study compared with our earlier study involving KO of the <italic>Osx</italic> gene in chondrocytes throughout embryonic development, there are several potential explanations. In this study, we opted to knock out the <italic>Osx</italic> gene in <italic>Osx</italic>-floxed mice that express <italic>Cre-ERT2</italic> in chondrocytes via a single injection of tamoxifen at P3 based on our earlier data that thyroid hormone levels start to rise at P5 followed by an increase in <italic>Osx</italic> expression in the epiphysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> It is possible that a single dose of tamoxifen was not sufficient to disrupt the <italic>Osx</italic> gene in all Col2&#x003b1;1-expressing epiphyseal chondrocytes while the mice with cartilage-specific Osx ablation lack Osx throughout embryonic development. In addition, a study published by Newton et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> reveals evidence that a stem-cell niche develops postnatally in the epiphyseal growth plate and provides a continuous supply of chondrocytes. Thus, osteogenic cells derived from mesenchymal stem cells after P3 are likely to express OSX because of the specificity of the Cre driver used. In our future studies, we will monitor the <italic>Cre-</italic>mediated excision of loxP sites at multiple time points after tamoxifen administration and inject tamoxifen at multiple times during the period when secondary ossification occurs to disrupt the <italic>Osx</italic> gene in chondrocytes throughout this period.</p><p id="Par15">Tamoxifen can act as a weak estrogen receptor agonist and produce an estrogen-like effect on bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> The kinetics of ER fusion protein activation in vivo have been investigated in recent studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> These studies have shown that the half-life of tamoxifen after a single intraperitoneal administration is about 12&#x02009;h&#x02013;16&#x02009;h and that the efficacy of tamoxifen to induce <italic>Cre-</italic>mediated recombination of target genes is more effective after multiple tamoxifen administrations than administration of a single dose.

Furthermore, the trabecular bone phenotype measured by &#x000b5;CT was not different between tamoxifen-treated WT mice and oil-treated, <italic>Cre</italic>-negative, <italic>Osx</italic>-floxed mice, thus suggesting that a single dose of tamoxifen at 200&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/mouse (40&#x02009;mg/kg) was not effective in producing estrogen-like effects on trabecular bone in the epiphysis.</p><p id="Par16">Chondrocyte differentiation is regulated by a coordinated balance of positive and negative signals from various transcription factors including activators, repressors, coactivators, and corepressors on the chromatin template.

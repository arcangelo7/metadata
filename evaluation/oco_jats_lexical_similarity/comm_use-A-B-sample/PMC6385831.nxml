inflammation-related disorders, trigger inflammation-induced immune responses, such
as pain, various infections and allergic reactions, and cell
regeneration<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Meanwhile, an antibody directed against an
IL-specific peptide shows anti-inflammatory functions<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. Of the IL family, IL-6
is a pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine, responsible for the pathogenesis of many
inflammation-related conditions, including infectious<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> and immunological
disorders<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>. A recent review comprehensively described the
profile of circulating IL-6 in relation to different cardiac
operations<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. As a response to the acute phase of an
inflammation, IL-6 has been proved to be an indicator of immunologic abnormalities
and constitutional symptoms of cardiac myxoma<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>. Clinical observations revealed that
circulating IL-6 levels closely correlated with the dimensions of cardiac
myxomas<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>, and that IL-6 levels could be reduced or diminished
shortly after surgical resection of a cardiac myxoma<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>. Soeparwata et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>
and Mendoza et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> found a positive correlation between the cardiac
myxoma size index (<italic>i.e</italic>., tumor volume) and circulating IL-6 levels.
We assumed that, besides the relationship between tumor size (maximal dimension
[length] and volume) and IL-6, there might also be close relations between IL-6 or
decrement (difference of pre- and postoperative values) of IL-6 (&#x02206;IL-6) and
the anatomic features of cardiac myxomas. In order to highlight these hypotheses, we
made a retrospective study on a small patient population undergoing cardiac myxoma
resection to evaluate circulating IL-6 levels in parallel with C-reactive protein
(CRP) levels.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>In total, 12 patients undergoing cardiac myxoma resection at The First Hospital of
Putian, Teaching Hospital, Fujian Medical University were enrolled into this study.
There were 9 (75%) female and 3 (25%) male patients. Their ages were 53.3 &#x000b1;
6.1 (range, 46-66; median, 51) years. No age difference was found between genders
(51.4 &#x000b1; 3.7 <italic>vs.</italic> 58.7 &#x000b1; 9.5,
<italic>P</italic>=0.0723).</p><p>All 12 patients were diagnosed with left atrial myxoma by transthoracic
echocardiography and it was verified by surgical operation and pathological
examinations of the resected tumors. They underwent cardiac myxoma resection with
the aid of cardiopulmonary bypass via a left atriotomy or a right atriotomy plus an
atrial septotomy approach. All patients survived the operation and were followed up.
No recurrence of cardiac myxoma was found in any patient during the follow-up
period.</p><p>Of the 12 patients, 11 (91.7%) had 1 cardiac myxoma and 1 (8.3%) had 1 big and 2 very
small myxomas, totaling 14 myxomas in all of them. Thirteen left atrial myxomas in
11 (91.7%) patients were arising from the atrial septum (5 of them from the fossa
ovalis) and 1 myxoma in 1 (8.3%) patient was arising from the free wall of the left
atrium. Seven (50%) myxomas were pedicled and 7 (50%) were sessile. Except for the 2
very small myxomas, the gross appearances of the remaining 12 myxomas were regular
in 7 (58.3%) patients and irregular in 5 (41.7%). One of the regular myxomas was
capsulated with dense membrane, and 1 of the irregular myxomas was villious.

levels as a result of the associated inflammatory and immune conditions. Jenni et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>
reported that IL-6 levels were elevated in 79% of 19 cardiac myxoma patients.
Mendoza et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> reported that the whole group of their 8 patients
showed preoperative elevated serum IL-6 levels, and cardiac myxoma resection led to
a remarkable reduction of IL-6 in these patients. Clinical observations revealed
that not only circulating IL-6, but also IL-6 antigen and IL-6 messenger ribonucleic
acid (mRNA), were significantly upregulated in cardiac myxoma tissues as a result of
activated immune reactions<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. Seino et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> observed increased expression of IL-6
mRNA in cardiac myxoma tissues of all their 3 patients, and their results supported
that IL-6 is overproduced by cardiac myxoma cells. Yaguchi et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> found that both serum and cerebrospinal fluid IL-6
levels were increased in cardiac myxoma patients in whom cerebral aneurysm has been
developed. This phenomenon was also observed by other authors<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>. Elevated IL-6 levels
were also associated with occurrence of pertinent sequelae, such as renal injury,
proteinuria<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>, and constitutional signs<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. Re-elevation of
circulating IL-6 was seen in patients with recurrent tumors, and the IL-6 level was
even much higher than in the first time occurrence<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. This was explained as
more severe cases of cardiac myxoma were usually associated with constitutional
symptoms and embolic events<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The present patient cohort included 12 cases of cardiac myxoma patients; all of them
had an elevated plasma IL-6 level preoperatively and a remarkable decrease of IL-6
after cardiac myxoma resection. Only 1 patient developed acute cerebral infarction
as a severe complication of cardiac myxoma, while the remaining 11 patients had
constitutional or mild neurological symptoms. Although much attention has been drawn
that IL-6 plays an important role in producing constitutional symptoms and severe
sequalae in patients with cardiac myxoma<sup>[<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>, we did not find any difference in
IL-6 levels between patients with and without constitutional symptoms. In addition,
we did not find differences in pre- and postoperative IL-6 levels between patients
with cardiac myxoma of irregular and regular appearances, neither between patients
with a pedicled or a sessile cardiac myxoma. The positive findings of the present
study were direct relationships between circulating IL-6 levels and tumor volume or
tumor dimension, which were in accordance to the results reported previously by
Mendoza et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> and Soeparwata et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. Irregular cardiac
myxomas have been proved to have gelatinous and fragile extensions with tendency of
spontaneous fragmentation<sup>[<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> and to be associated with increased risks of
myxoma-related embolic events<sup>[<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>. Moreover, regular cardiac myxomas are prone to
develop cerebral aneurysms and highly elevated serum IL-6<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>. The higher IL-6
levels in patients with irregular myxoma might hint an enlarged tumor surface in
charge of more abundant production of cytokines. The higher IL-6 and CRP levels in
patients with sessile cardiac myxoma might implicate that more cells or exposed
endothelium might remain in the large sessile myxomas.</p><p>It has been noted that most patients with cardiac myxoma had leukocytosis or high CRP
levels prior to cardiac myxoma resection<sup>[<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup>. Only recently, Durgut et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup>
described in a retrospective study that cardiac myxoma resection led to a
significant decrease of CRP from preoperative 47.3&#x000b1;14.6 mg/L to postoperative
8.4&#x000b1;2.6 mg/L period. The inherent relations between IL-6 and CRP in cardiac
myxoma patients have been described as that IL-6 could trigger the release of CRP.
In line with this theory, we observed close direct relations between preoperative
IL-6 and preoperative CRP, and between &#x02206;IL-6 and &#x02206;CRP. The correlation
analyses between IL-6 or CRP levels and anatomic features of cardiac myxomas proved
that IL-6 levels were more sensitive than CRP in predicting the inflammatory status
of cardiac myxoma patients.</p><p>Our study was confined to a limited number of patients and the results might have
some biases owing to the lack of the necessary patient information. As no recurrent
cardiac myxoma case was included in the present patient cohort, the predictive value
of IL-6 in tumor recurrence was not evaluated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Anatomic features of cardiac myxomas (sessile, irregular appearance, maximal
dimensions, and volumes) could be determinants of the patients' circulating IL-6
levels. In comparison to CRP, IL-6 was likely to be a more sensitive biomarker in
predicting the inflammatory status of cardiac myxoma patients. Sessile and irregular
cardiac myxomas might predict more severe inflammatory conditions for their more
abundant endothelial cells owing to the enlarged dimension and tumor volume that are
responsible for the overproduction of cytokines.</p><table-wrap id="t3" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="5%" span="1"/><col width="95%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SMY</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Conception or design of the work;

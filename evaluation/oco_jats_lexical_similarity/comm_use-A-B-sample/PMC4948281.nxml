Until now, the function of miR-26a in osteosarcoma remains largely elusive. Here, we found that miR-26a was downregualted in osteosarcoma tissues. Using <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> assays, we confirmed that miR-26a could inhibit the abilities of <italic>in vitro</italic> proliferation and suppress <italic>in vivo</italic> tumor growth in mouse model. Furthermore, we identified insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) as a novel and direct target of miR-26a and revealed that miR-26a exerted its tumor-suppressor function, at least in part, by inhibiting IGF-1 expression. These findings contribute to our understanding of the functions of miR-26a in osteosarcoma.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignancy, and it arises primarily in the metaphysis of the long bones in adolescents and young adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> It leads to many deaths because of its rapid proliferation and metastasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> Recent studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in various cancer-related processes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> miRNAs are a group of endogenously expressed, non-coding small RNAs (20&#x02013;25 nucleotides in length). miRNAs negatively regulate the expression of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) by suppressing translation or decreasing the stability of mRNAs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> It has been found that miRNAs play crucial roles in various biological processes, including development, differentiation, apoptosis, and cell proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> An increasing number of studies have demonstrated that miRNAs can function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors, and they are often dysregulated in tumors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7 bib8 bib9 bib10">7&#x02013;10</xref></sup></p><p>There are still controversies about the roles of miR-26a in human malignancies, as it is a tumor suppressor in breast cancer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> gastric cancer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> and hepatocellular carcinoma,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> but is an oncogene in glioma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> and cholangiocarcinoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> Although miR-26a was found to be downregulated in osteosarcoma previously,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> its biological function and precise mechanism in osteosarcoma remain largely elusive.</p><p>In this study, we confirmed the downregulation of miR-26a in osteosarcoma tissues.

These cells were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 medium (Gibco, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) at 37 &#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco).</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical specimens</title><p>Tumor tissues and adjacent nontumor normal tissues were collected from routine therapeutic surgery at our department after obtaining informed consent in accordance with a protocol approved by the Ethics Committee of Southern Medical University (Guangzhou, China).</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative RT-PCR analysis</title><p>The total RNAs were extracted from cells with TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). For the detection of miR-26a, RT and PCR reactions were performed by means of qSYBR-green-containing PCR kit (GeneCopoeia, Rockville, MD, USA), and U6 snRNA was used as an endogenous control for miRNA detection. For IGF-1 mRNA, cDNA was synthesized from 1 &#x003bc;g of total RNA by means of Reverse Reaction kit according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was amplified in parallel as an internal control.

Yielding mutant constructs, mutations were introduced in potential miR-26a binding sites using the QuikChange site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). One microgram of the wild type or mutant UTR of IGF-1 were cotransfected either with 50 nmol&#x022c5;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of miR-26a mimics or negative control (NC) into HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).

Consistent with the previous report,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> miR-26a was significantly downregulated in osteosarcoma tissues compared to the paired bone tissues. Among the 32 patients with osteosarcoma, approximately 79% (22 of 32 patients) of tumors revealed a more than twofold reduction in miR-26a levels, with a 5.76-fold reduction relative to adjacent normal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These results suggest that the miR-26a might play a critical role in the osteosarcoma initiation.</p></sec><sec><title>miR-26a suppresses osteosarcoma cell proliferation</title><p>To evaluate the biological significance of miR-26a in the development of osteosarcoma, we transfected with miR-26a mimic or inhibitor into MG-63 and U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), and examined cell proliferation using direct cell counting and MTS assays. Overexpression of miR-26a inhibited cell proliferation, whereas inhibition of miR-26a promoted cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b and c</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>miR-26a suppresses tumor growth in mouse xenografts</title><p>To investigate the <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of miR-26a on osteosarcoma tumorigenesis, we stably overexpressed and knocked down miR-26a in MG-63 cells by lentivirus. The efficiency was confirmed through RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Next, nude mice transplanted with MG-63 cells infected either with miR-26a, anti-miR-26a, or NC. We found that the overexpression of miR-26a in MG-63 cells significantly suppressed tumor growth in nude mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b&#x02013;d</xref>). In contrast, knockdown of miR-26a in MG-63 cells was found to promote tumor growth in mice <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b, c</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">d</xref>). These results indicate that miR-26a may repress osteosarcoma tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>miR-26a inhibits cell proliferation by targeting IGF-1 in osteosarcoma cells</title><p>Using <italic>in silico</italic> prediction programs, we identified IGF-1 as a potential target for miR-26a. The 3&#x02019;-UTR of IGF-1 mRNA (position 3689&#x02013;3695 of IGF-1 3&#x02019;-UTR) harbored sequences complementary to the miR-26a seed sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>) and the seed-recognizing region is conserved across species. To verify whether IGF-1 is a direct target of miR-26a, we cloned the wild-type 3&#x02019;-UTR or the mutant (lacking the 7-bp seed sequence) into a luciferase reporter vector. When we cotransfected HEK293 cells with the cloned 3&#x02019;-UTR and miR-26a mimics, we observed a consistent reduction in luciferase activity for 3&#x02019;-UTR by miR-26a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Conversely, cotransfection of miR-26a mimics with the mutated form of the 3&#x02019;-UTR resulted in no significant change in luciferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>), suggesting miR-26a directly targets the IGF-1 3&#x02019;-UTR. In agreement, miR-26a overexpression significantly reduced both mRNA and protein expression for IGF-1 in MG-63 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c and d</xref>). Furthermore, miR-26a inhibitors transfection increased its mRNA and protein levels, further indicating that IGF-1 is a target of miR-26a in osteosarcoma cells.</p><p>The above results prompted us to examine whether miR-26a suppresses osteosarcoma growth by inhibiting IGF-1 expression. For this purpose, we transfected plasmid pReceiver containing IGF-1 or empty plasmid in MG-63 cells transfected with miR26a to recover IGF-I expression. IGF1 was overexpressed in miR-26a-transfected MG-63 cells. In miR-26a-expressing cells, overexpression of IGF-1 rescued growth defects of miR-26a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e and f</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we examined IGF1 expression in <italic>n</italic>=32 pairs of osteosarcoma and matched adjacent tissues by qRT-PCR. The result showed that IGF-1 expression was increased in osteosarcoma relative to the paired bone tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). There was an inverse correlation between miR-26a expression and IGF1 expression in osteosarcoma tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>)</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Recent studies have revealed a critical role for miRNAs in tumor initiation and progression, including in osteosarcoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17 bib18 bib19">17&#x02013;19</xref></sup> In the present study, we determined that the level of miR-26a expression was significantly lower in osteosarcomas than that in adjacent nontumor tissue. Using <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> assays, we identify the tumor suppressor function of miR-26a in osteosarcoma. By upregulating and downregulating miR-26a in osteosarcoma cells, we confirmed that miR-26a could inhibit the abilities of <italic>in vitro</italic> proliferation and suppress <italic>in vivo</italic> tumor growth. Furthermore, we also identified IGF-1 as a novel and direct target of miR-26a. Our findings suggest that miR-26a has a suppressor role in osteosarcoma tumorigenesis.</p><p>Several previous studies support our results. For example, miR-26a is decreased in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and could suppress tumor angiogenesis of HCC through hepatocyte growth factor -cMet signalling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> Breast cancer also exhibits decreased expression of miR-26a and overexpression of this miRNA results in inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> However, others indicate that it exhibits oncogenic properties in glioma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> and cholangiocarcinoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> For example, miR-26a is overexpressed in cholangiocarcinoma and promotes cholangiocarcinoma growth by activating B-catenin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> These controversial results suggested that the role of miR-26a was possibly tumor-specific and highly dependent on its targets in different cancer cells. Various studies have shown that PTEN,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> EZH2,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> SMAD1,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> CDK6, and cyclin E1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> are potential downstream target genes of miR-26. In this study, we found that IGF-1 serves as a downstream mediator of tumor suppressor function in osteosarcoma.</p><p>It is well known that IGF-1 plays important roles in cell proliferation, motility, and metastasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> Amplified IGF-1/IGF-1R signaling is not only associated with development of tumors, but also contributes to tumor cell survival, invasion, metastasis, and resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> In our studies, we confirmed that IGF-1 was a direct target of miR-26a in osteosarcoma cells. To determine whether miR-26a suppresses osteosarcoma cell proliferation through targeting IGF-1, we found that IGF-1 overexpression could rescue growth inhibition of miR-26a. Moreover, there was an inverse correlation between miR-26a expression and IGF-1 expression in osteosarcoma tissues. These results suggest that miR-26a inhibits osteosarcoma cell proliferation partly by targeting IGF1.</p><p>Taken together, the current study provided novel evidence that miR-26a is significantly downregulated in osteosarcoma clinical specimens and appears to function as a tumor suppressor in osteosarcoma through the regulation of IGF-1 expression and cell proliferation. These results may help us understand the molecular mechanism of osteosarcoma tumorigenesis, and provide us with a strong rationale to further investigate miR-26a as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for osteosarcoma.</p></sec></body><back><notes><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></notes><ref-list><ref id="bib1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">He JP, Hao Y, Wang XL et al. <article-title>Review of the molecular pathogenesis of osteosarcoma.</article-title>

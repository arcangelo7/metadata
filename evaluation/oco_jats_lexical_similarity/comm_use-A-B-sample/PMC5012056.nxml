These biomaterials uniquely combine adaptability to various clinical applications to proven tissue regeneration properties. In the present work, the biomaterials were formulated either as hydrogel or as paste formulation and their potential as wound dressing material or as dermal substitute was assessed by two <italic>in vivo</italic> models in pig skin: The healing full-thickness punch biopsy model and the non-healing full-thickness polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) chamber model. The results clearly show that collagen deposition is induced by the presence of these biomaterials. A unique pattern of early inflammatory response, eliciting neutrophils and controlling macrophage infiltration, is followed by tissue cell colonization of the wound bed with a significant deposition of collagen fibers. The study also highlighted the importance in the use of optimal formulations and appropriate handling upon implantation. In large size, non-healing wounds, wound dermis was best obtained with the paste formulation as hydrogels appeared to be too loose to ensure lasting scaffolding properties. On the contrary, packing of the granules during the application of paste reduced biomaterial degradation rate and prevent the penetration of newly vascularized tissue, thus impeding grafting of split-thickness autologous skin grafts on the dermal substitute base.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Key words</title><kwd>Dermal substitutes</kwd><kwd><italic>in vivo</italic> models</kwd><kwd>wound dressings</kwd><kwd>soyabean-based biomaterials</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bioengineered products able to support the healing of chronic ulcers, deep wounds and burns are in increased demand to improve patients&#x02019; quality of life and survival rate.

Indeed, biomaterials based on protein or polysaccharide composition such as collagen, glycosaminoglycans, agarose, alginate, chitosan and fibrin glue have been shown to be able to promote interactions with biochemical and cellular components leading, for example, to hemostatic functions (<italic>e.g.</italic>, alginate and fibrin) and to bioligand-driven cell activity control (<italic>e.g.</italic>, collagen and hyaluronan). However, the use of biopolymers in regenerative medicine is limited by their antigenic potential, by the risks of transmittable diseases, by batch-to-batch variability and, in some cases, by their relatively high extraction costs.</p><p>For example, collagen-based materials have been investigated more extensively as scientists tried to produce dermal substitutes mimicking normal skin where dermal collagen plays very important roles in structure and function. Initially, raw human or animal skin, either fresh or frozen, was used to cover wounds but immunological reactions were soon observed leading to poor experimental and clinical performances.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] These immunological reactions were attributed to the presence of cellular component and led to the use of decellularized dermal sheets. These showed no rejection upon implantation while providing solid dermal wound bed for the later application of split-thickness skin grafts.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] Although this approach has been clinically successful, it still brings drawbacks that need to be resolved. First, there is a problem of transmissible diseases. Although donors are screened extensively and manufacturing processes minimize such a possibility, risks still exist. Ethical issues have also to be considered as important for some religious groups.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] Furthermore, the logistics, suitable donor selection, coordination of skin banks networks and the storage of human-derived products are all major issues associated with this approach and limiting its use. Dermal substitutes of non-human origin like Integra&#x000ae;, Matriderm&#x000ae; and Terudermis&#x000ae;, although still expensive to produce and store, are less subject to the ethical and cross-contamination issues since animals have an interspecies resistance to some viral disease.</p><p>In the last decade, a new class of natural biomaterials derived from de-fatted soybean flour processed by thermoset or extraction procedures has been developed.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] These biomaterials uniquely combine adaptability to various clinical applications to clear tissue regeneration properties. Formulations can be easily prepared that span from films and granules to hydrogels and pastes or bioglues. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies on fibroblasts, osteoblasts and macrophages as well as <italic>in vivo</italic> studies of bone regeneration have clearly demonstrated the healing properties of these biomaterials.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]</p><p>These biomaterials need to be distinguished from those based on soy protein only.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] Soy protein scaffolds, for example, have been fabricated using freeze-drying and 3D printing and tested for their biocompatibility <italic>in vivo</italic> by a subcutaneous implant model in mice.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] The study compared the soy protein with bovine collagen in terms of acute and humoral immune response showing that soy scaffolds fully degraded after 14 days with no sign of fibrosis as opposed to collagen scaffolds that remained intact for 56 days. Immunological analysis showed no soy-specific IgE indicating the absence of allergic response to the soy implants. Likewise, a rat wound-dressing model of partial-thickness skin wounds was used to study newly developed chitosan/soy-based membranes as wound dressing materials showing high healing properties of these materials when compared to a commercially available dressing such as Epigard&#x000ae;.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]</p><p>This paper shows for the first time the healing properties of soybean-based hydrogels and pastes in 2 pre-clinical <italic>in vivo</italic> models based on healing (full-thickness punch biopsy model) and non-healing (full-thickness chamber model) wounds in pigs.</p><p>Porcine animal models have been widely utilized for wound healing and skin regeneration studies as the most similar to the relative clinical applications.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] The use of punch biopsies to create experimental wounds has been described for several animal models, including guinea pig for skin studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] Punch biopsy models in pigs were also used for skin wound healing studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] A percutaneous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) full-thickness wound chamber pig model has also been previously used in many studies such as those assessing biointegration of different types of biomaterials and skin cells and has shown excellent results.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Material preparation</title><p>Soybean-based biomaterials were prepared from de-fatted soybean flour as previously described.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] Briefly, soybean-based hydrogels were obtained by extraction of soybean protein, carbohydrate and isoflavone fraction through a 80/20% ethanol/water extraction process.

The study was carried out in two experimental stages. As a first stage, biointegration of biomaterials was assessed in one animal. The second stage included the assessment of the wound healing properties of soybean-based biomaterials in two animals. The healing process starts immediately after wounding but the most active proliferative phase occurs between 5 and 21 days with maximum effect between the 7<sup>th</sup> and 14<sup>th</sup> day. As a consequence, punch biopsies were taken at two time points: 8 and 15 days post-implantation. Sample evaluation of integrated materials at day 27 was performed to assess the relatively long-term performance of the applied materials. A 10 mm punch was used to harvest biopsies. Upon removal, each biopsy was bisected vertically, one-half was processed to paraffin wax embedding by routine automated procedures and the other half was frozen for cryo-sectioning. Paraffin sections (5 &#x000b5;m) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) to reveal basic structure of the tissue, and with picrosirius red (PSR) for collagen deposition visualization. Birefringence images were also taken to study collagen orientation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Full-thickness chamber model</title><p>Seven large white/landrace crossbred pigs obtained from a single registered supplier were used for this study. A total of 42 experimental wounds were created with 6 per animal. Wounds were treated with soybean-based biomaterials in addition to a number of alternative biomaterials (data published elsewhere).</p><p>Two circular skin grafts 5 cm in diameter and 500 &#x000b5;m thick were harvested and reapplied to the excised wound serving as a control treatment group. The epithelial layer was trimmed with a Zimmer air dermatome (setting 3, 6/1000th of an inch) before dermal harvest was performed.

The lack of consistency and long-term stability of the hydrogel prompted the development of two new soybean-based paste formulations that were tested in combination to split-thickness autologous skin grafts.</p><p>Paste (1.3 ml) was extruded from a syringe, and a circular layer of approximately 5 cm in diameter and 1 mm thick was then formed with a spatula.</p><p>Split-thickness autologous skin graft approximately 5 cm &#x000d7; 5 cm &#x000d7; 0.015 cm was harvested with an air-driven Zimmer air dermatome.

Taking such biopsies at different time points allowed assessment of the time of biointegration and the most appropriate time for split-thickness skin grafting for each biomaterial based on progression of the neovasculature network formation.</p><p>Wound dressings were changed every 3 days with simultaneous clinical wound assessment. Full-thickness wound excision biopsies were done at day 3, 6 and 14. Three 5.0 mm punch biopsy samples (top, middle and bottom of the wound) within each chamber were taken to assess material integration. The same procedure was repeated on day 4 and 7. On day 14, wounds were harvested by excision and 10 mm biopsies were taken within harvested tissue samples. Upon removal, each biopsy was bisected vertically, one-half was processed to paraffin wax embedding by routine automated procedures and the other half was frozen for cryo-sectioning. Paraffin sections (5 mm) were stained with HE to reveal basic structure of the tissue and with PSR for collagen deposition visualization. Cryo-sections were processed for immunohistochemical staining by incubation in a humidified chamber for 20 min with normal goat serum (Sigma-Aldrich Company Ltd., UK) and a further hour with the primary rabbit anti-human von Willebrand factor polyclonal antibody (anti-vWF, DakoCytomation, UK) used at a 1:40,000 final dilution to identify blood vessel formation. To study the epithelial cover, cryo-sections were also processed for immunofluorescent staining with mouse monoclonal anti-human cytokeratin 14 (clone LL002) antibody at a 1:50 dilution. Rabbit anti-human von Willebrand factor polyclonal antibody (1:200 concentrate) was used at 1:200 dilution to identify blood vessel formation. Macrophage/L1 Protein/calprotectin Ab-1 (clone MAC 387) antibody was used at 1:40 dilution for tissue macrophage visualization. Tissue sections were washed with PBS and incubated for one further hour with secondary antibody fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (MP Biomedicals, UK) at 1:100 dilution as recommended by the supplier.</p><p>The stained tissue sections were viewed and analyzed through a fluorescent microscope, Olympus BH2, and photographed within 24 h of staining using a Spot 1.1.0 digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc., USA) and Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics, Inc., USA).

However, deposition of new collagen gradually infiltrating the granules from the bottom of the wound upward was clearly observed by both PSR staining and birefringence microscopy [Figures <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>, <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">e</xref>, <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">g</xref>, <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">h</xref>]. The latter highlighted relatively thick fibers (orange birefringence), which is typical of more mature collagen. This newly formed extracellular matrix appeared to replace the granulocyte-rich infiltrates.

At this point, experimental wounds with applied soybean-based paste revealed two distinct patterns of vascularization; soybean-based paste showing relatively compacting of granules did not show vascular in-growth deeper than 200&#x02013;300 &#x000b5;m; [Figure <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>], whereas wounds with dispersed soybean-based particles were infiltrated by new microvasculature throughout their thickness [Figures <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7d</xref> and <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">g</xref>]. The degree of collagen deposition followed the same pattern with the less compacted granules allowing a full penetration of new extracellular matrix [Figures <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref> and <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">c</xref>]. High magnification histology clearly showed the infiltration of collagen fibrils throughout the granules and within their degrading structure [Figure <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7h</xref>], while birefringence clearly showed their ordered structure [Figure <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7i</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Skin damages generated by pathologies or trauma require the support of wound dressing and dermal substitutes capable of encouraging tissue regeneration while protecting the wound bed from infections and dehydration. Unless expensive and potentially carcinogenic growth factors are uploaded in the hydrogel mesh,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] wound dressings are of relatively simple composition and design as they are primarily engineered to keep the wound moist, oxygenated and protected by external microbial insults. For these reasons, wound dressings are mainly used in the treatment of chronic foot and leg ulcers as well as in the case of burns of limited area surface. Their ability to promote healing is very limited in the case of chronic ulcers as those occurring in diabetic patients or in the case of pressure ulcers as those caused by long-term dwelling in static positions.</p><p>Dermal substitutes (acellular and cellularized) have been made available to clinicians to intervene on large-area wounds and burns.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]</p><p>Recent investigations about the use of soybean as a potential source for biomaterials have highlighted that these biomaterials in the form of films, granules, hydrogel or paste exert several specific bioactivities on various types of tissue cells and promote bone regeneration <italic>in vivo</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] Previous studies have also shown that these tissue regeneration properties can be ascribed to the unique combination of the scaffolding properties of these biomaterial and presence of isoflavones, plant estrogens capable of selectively interacting with the estrogen receptor (ER) &#x003b2; of the nuclear membrane rather than the ERa, thus activating cell differentiation rather than proliferation with a consequent induction of the production of extracellular matrix components, that is, collagen.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] Interestingly, it is known that skin is the largest non-reproductive system target for estrogens and their effect is executed through nuclear estrogen receptors ERa and ER&#x003b2;.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] ER&#x003b2; is particularly widespread in skin and expressed in basal keratinocytes, bulge region of hair follicles and papillary dermis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] The lack of estrogens results in skin thickness reduction, skin dryness, loss of elasticity and poor wound healing.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] Activation of ERa and ER&#x003b2; keratinocyte receptors as well as reported transactivation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor by estrogens[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] may explain estrogen-induced keratinocyte proliferation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] Estrogens were found to reduce apoptosis, induced by the oxidative stress in human keratinocytes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] Estrogens also exhibit their effect on dermal component of the skin by increasing fibroblasts proliferation. These observations prompted the pre-clinical validation of the soybean-based biomaterials when formulated as hydrogel or as paste (mix of thermoset granules and hydrogel) and to the purpose of using them either as wound dressing material or as dermal substitute to support split-thickness skin grafts in burns or other types of extended skin loss.</p><p>The use of two <italic>in vivo</italic> models of skin regeneration in pigs clearly highlighted the ability of these natural biomaterials to reduce a chronic inflammatory response driven by macrophages common to many other biomaterials and to stimulate the deposition of collagen during the healing process. These findings confirmed previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies showing the inhibition of macrophages and the stimulation of fibroblast collagen synthesis by these biomaterials.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] In particular, a healing model such as the full-thickness punch biopsy showed that soybean-based hydrogels of a relatively loose consistency are suitable for the treatments of relatively small and deep defects such as those of chronic foot ulcers. The fluidity of the biomaterial allow its in-depth penetration into the wound bed where it stimulates the acute inflammation in the early phase and stimulate a gradual deposition of new extracellular matrix where collagen fibers acquire an orientation similar to that of the healthy dermis. The fluidity of the hydrogel also support wound contraction, a process that is fundamental to wound closure.</p><p>However, the same hydrogel formulation was shown to be not suitable for the treatment of large defects as it was not able to offer sufficient and stable scaffolding role for the regenerating tissue. Toward this end, a soybean paste consisting of a mix of granules derived from the thermosetting of soybean curd and of the same hydrogel was used as such or further reinforced by cross-linking with a natural dialdehyde, the genipin. These new paste formulations were used in the non-healing full thickness chamber model where a PTFE ring prevents tissue in-growth from the periphery of the wound bed and allows regeneration only from its bottom. The experiments clearly showed that the two types of pastes could ensure stability and tissue scaffolding properties over a longer period of time as they were still present after 25 days of implantation. Uniquely, the fast degradation of the hydrogels was creating space among the more stable granules that gradually encouraged tissue infiltration, first in form of acute inflammatory response exhibiting a prevalence of neutrophils to that of macrophages, later inducing the thorough invasion of new dermis where collagen and vessels gradually progressed from the bottom of the wound toward its surface. However, the data also showed that the optimal formulation of the paste is as important as its biocompatibility and tissue regeneration properties. In fact, when granules were excessively packed in the wound bed during the surgical procedure, tissue in-growth was delayed or even substantially inhibited. This was detrimental not only for the process of infiltration of newly deposited collagen and blood vessels, but also for the survival of autologous skin grafts applied on the biomaterial-treated wounds. Only when spacing among granules were ensured, split grafts were capable of surviving and integrating with the surrounding healthy tissue, encouraging both collagen formation and angiogenesis.</p><p>The present pre-clinical study clearly shows the tissue regeneration potential of soybean-based biomaterials. The use of these biomaterials present a number of potential advantages including:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>A degradation time faster than collagen-based biomaterials;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]</p></list-item><list-item><p>An inflammatory response maintaining the neutrophil/macrophage balance in favor of the neutrophils, thus reducing the risks of infections and of a chronic inflammation leading to scarring;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]</p></list-item><list-item><p>The stimulation of collagen synthesis and angiogenesis promoting tissue repair in wounds not capable of spontaneous healing.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Together with the relatively simple manufacturing process of these biomaterial and flexible formulations, these properties highlight the clinical potential of these biomaterials that can represent a unique alternative to less performing dressings and dermal substitutes. However, the study also indicates that the clinical outcome of wounds treated by these biomaterials relies on the optimal design of their formulation and correct use by the practitioners.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec11"><title>New Features on the Journal&#x02019;s Website</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>(1) Advanced online publications (AOP)</title><p>Articles accepted will be published online before being included in a printed edition, so it can be available earlier.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>(2) APP for iPad&#x000ae;</title><p>A free application to browse and search the journal&#x02019;s content is available for iPad&#x000ae;.

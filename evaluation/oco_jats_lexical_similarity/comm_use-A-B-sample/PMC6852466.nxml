symptoms related to the aortic valve dysfunction. The surgical treatment is usually
indicated in the fifth or sixtieth decades and follow the current guidelines for
valvular diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>CASES REPORT</title><sec><title>Case 01</title><p>A 53 year-old male patient with a progressive worsening of symptoms of dyspnea in
the last three years was admitted to our institution for a routine evaluation.
At the time, he had a marked limitation of physical activity associated to
orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and an isolated episode of syncope. The
physical examination demonstrated both systolic and diastolic murmurs in the
right upper sternal border with radiation to both carotid arteries.
Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a severe stenotic and mild/moderate
insufficient aortic valve with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)
preserved (54%). The intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram revealed a
quadricuspid aortic valve. In the surgical field, the aortic valve was composed
by four retracted and calcified cusps and it was classified as a Type C in the
Hurwitz and Roberts classification. There were two equal larger cusps and two
equal smaller cusps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). Due to the
calcification and retraction of all leaflets, the patient was submitted to a
convencional aortic valve replacement.A Braile<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 25mm Bovine
Pericardium Bioprosthesis was implanted. The patient had a short in-hospital
postoperative recovery and remains asymptomatic after five years of
follow-up.</p><p>

</p></sec><sec><title>Case 2</title><p>A 57 year-old female patient with a progressive worsening of dyspnea in the
previous six months was admitted to our institution for an elective surgery. At
the time she had a marked limitation of physical activity. The physical
examination demonstrated a diastolic murmur +3/+6 at the left middle sternal
border. A Transthoracic Echocardiogram revealed a severe insufficient aortic
valve with LVEF preserved (57%); however the exam did not describe any
malformation in the aortic valve. The intraoperative transesophageal
echocardiogram revealed a quadricuspid aortic valve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). In the surgical field, the aortic valve was
composed by four retracted cusps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure
2B</xref>) and it was classified as a Type E in the Hurwitz and Roberts
classification. There were three equal cusps and one larger cusp. Due to the
cusps retraction, the patient was submitted to a conventional aortic valve
replacement. A Braile<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 21mm Bovine Pericardium Bioprosthesis
was implanted. The patient had a short in-hospital postoperative recovery and
remains asymptomatic after six months of follow-up.</p><p>

</p></sec><sec><title>Case 3</title><p>A 51 year-old female patient with a progressive worsening of symptoms of fatigue
and dyspnea in the previous 12 months was admitted to our institution for an
elective surgery. At the time, she had a marked limitation of physical activity.
The physical examination demonstrated a diastolic murmur +3/+6 at the left
middle sternal border. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a severe
insufficient aortic valve with LVEF preserved (71%). Signs of malcoaptation were
noticed between the cusps, although an accurate anatomical characterization was
not possible due to limitation of the acoustic window in the transverse plane.
The intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram revealed a quadricuspid aortic
valve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). In the surgical field,
the aortic valve was composed by four retracted cusps and it was classified as a
Type B in the Hurwitz and Roberts classification. There were three equal cusps
and one smaller cusp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>). The
patient underwent a minimally invasive aortic valve surgery through superior
mini-sternotomy with an "Inverted L" incision in the fourth right intercostal
space. The extracorporeal circulation was placed in both right femoral artery
and vein. The aortic valve was replaced by a Braile<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 23mm
Bovine Pericardium Bioprosthesis. The procedure was successful, and the patient
had an excellent in-hospital postoperative recovery and remains asymptomatic
after 12 months of follow-up.</p><p>

</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>QAV is a rare congenital heart disease with an incidence of 0,008% to 0,033% in
autopsy series and 0,013-0,043% for patients undergoing transthoracic
echocardiographic examinations<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The mechanisms of QAV development remain unclear. The main hypothesis is the abnormal
septation of embryological arterial trunk. Abnormal cusp formation occurs either to
aberrant fusion of the aorticopulmonary septum or to abnormal proliferations in the
common trunk<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. It is usually an
isolated anomaly, but other congenital heart defects can be present in 18-32% of the
patients and coronary artery and coronary ostium anomalies are the most frequent
associated disorders<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The most widely used classification is the one by Hurwitz and Roberts<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>, which divides 7 alphabetical
subtypes based on the cusps size: type A - 4 identical leaflets, type B - 3
identical leaflets and 1 smaller leaflet, type C - 2 larger identical leaflets and 2
smaller identical leaflets, type D - 1 larger leaflet, 2 intermediate leaflets and 1
smaller leaflet, type E - 3 identical leaflets and 1 larger leaflet, type F - 2
larger identical leaflets and 2 smaller non-identical leaflets, type G - 4
non-identical leaflets. According to these authors, about 87% of cases presented the
types A, B or C.</p><p>On echocardiogram, the quadricuspid aortic valve is identified by its characteristic
&#x0201c;X&#x0201d; shape during diastole (different from the &#x0201c;Y&#x0201d; of the standard trivalvular aortic
valve) and its rectangular shape during systole. It tends to evolve to failure over
decades due to the asymmetry in the distribution of transvalvar flow and inequality
in coaptation of the leaflets<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.
For this reason, some cases of mixed valve dysfunction have been described, but the
finding of pure valvular stenosis is very rare. Besides, a small supernumerary cusp
can be a predictive risk factor of infective endocarditis<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The surgical treatment is indicated for symptomatic patients, left ventricular
dysfunction and left ventricular remodeling in the presence of important
dysfunctional aortic valve. The decision about valvular repair or replacement
depends on the valvular characteristics and the surgeons experience. Aortic valve
repair is performed in about 25% of cases in which the tricuspidization accounts for
80% of the repair procedures, especially in the Type B valves<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In our cases, the aortic valve replacement was the surgical choice due to the severe
structural disorder on the native valves. Patients with QAV may be followed-up to
early detect the beginning or the worsening of clinical conditions and prompt
surgical treatment assure good mid-to-long term results.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="10%" span="1"/><col width="90%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ETV</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Substantial contributions to the

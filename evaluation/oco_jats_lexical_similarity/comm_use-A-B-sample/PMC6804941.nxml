Communication between cancer cells and skeletal cells in metastatic bone microenvironments is a principal element that drives tumor progression and osteolysis. Tumor-derived factors play fundamental roles in this form of communication. To identify soluble factors released from cancer cells in bone metastasis, we established a highly bone-metastatic subline of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. This subline (mtMDA) showed a markedly elevated ability to secrete S100A4 protein, which directly stimulated osteoclast formation via surface receptor RAGE. Recombinant S100A4 stimulated osteoclastogenesis in vitro and bone loss in vivo. Conditioned medium from mtMDA cells in which S100A4 was knocked down had a reduced ability to stimulate osteoclasts. Furthermore, the S100A4 knockdown cells elicited less bone destruction in mice than the control knockdown cells. In addition, administration of an anti-S100A4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that we developed attenuated the stimulation of osteoclastogenesis and bone loss by mtMDA in mice. Taken together, our results suggest that S100A4 released from breast cancer cells is an important player in the osteolysis caused by breast cancer bone metastasis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Bone cancer</kwd><kwd>Homeostasis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2017R1D1A1B03028003</award-id><award-id>NRF-2018R1A5A2024418</award-id><award-id>NRF-2017R1D1A1B03028003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Haemin</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Hong-Hee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Bone metastasis affects &#x0003e;80% of patients with breast cancer at advanced stages of the disease and causes severe pain, fracture, hypercalcemia, and nerve compression, leading to increased morbidity and mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> Most bone metastases of breast cancer are catabolic to the skeleton. The osteolytic nature of breast cancer bone metastasis is attributed to a vicious cycle between the tumor cells and the local bone environment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> In this process, tumor cells that have metastasized to bone secrete factors such as parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) and interleukin 8 to stimulate osteoclast formation either directly or indirectly via induction of receptor activator of nuclear factor (NF)-&#x003ba;B ligand (RANKL; the osteoclast differentiation factor) in osteoblasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> The consequent increase in bone resorption leads to the release of latent matrix-associated growth factors that enhance tumor growth. Among the released factors, transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b2; plays a crucial role in the vicious cycle by upregulating PTHrP expression in tumor cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> In addition to their central role in the vicious cycle of bone destruction, osteoclasts have been proposed in recent studies to reactivate tumor cells from a dormant state, established after colonization in the bone microenvironment, to a proliferating state.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> Therefore, given our current understanding of the microenvironment, molecules that mediate communication between osteoclasts and tumor cells are attractive therapeutic targets for bone-metastatic cancers.</p><p id="Par3">S100A4, a calcium-binding S100 family protein, has been characterized as an important regulator of cancer progression and metastasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> S100A4 has been shown to modulate the proliferation, apoptosis, motility, and invasiveness of various types of tumor cells. Several distinct mechanisms have been implicated in the molecular function of S100A4. For the cytoskeletal modulations required for cell motility, adhesion, and invasion, S100A4 interacts with non-muscle myosin II, liprin, and ezrin in the cytoplasm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> To regulate apoptosis, S100A4 interacts with and suppresses the DNA-binding activity of the tumor-suppressor protein p53.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> In addition to these intracellular mechanisms, extracellular actions of S100A4 include the stimulation of neurite outgrowth, angiogenesis, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity, and migration of astrocytic tumor cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> Although both intracellular and extracellular functions of S100A4 have been shown to be associated with tumor progression and metastasis, the precise mechanism of action of S100A4 remains elusive. In addition, the role of S100A4 in bone metastasis of breast cancers has not yet been reported.</p><p id="Par4">In this study, we found that a highly bone-metastatic subline of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells released more S100A4 than the parental cells and had a greater stimulatory effect on osteoclastogenesis. The effect of S100A4 on osteoclasts was mediated by the cell surface receptor RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products). Furthermore, we provide in vivo evidence for the role of tumor-derived S100A4 in bone destruction and osteoclast formation by examining the effects of silencing the S100A4 gene and of a S100A4-blocking antibody (Ab) in a mouse xenograft model of breast cancer bone metastasis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Bone-metastatic breast cancer cells stimulate osteoclastogenesis in RANKL-dependent and RANKL-independent manners</title><p id="Par5">To obtain breast cancer cells with a high potency to metastasize to bone, we utilized a previously reported in vivo selection method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> MDA-MB-231 (MDA) cells were injected into the left ventricle of immune-deficient Balb-c/nu mice. After 8 weeks, the tibiae and femurs were flushed, and the collected cells were cultured for 2 months to remove mortal mouse cells while selecting immortal cancer cells. These cells were then reinjected in the mice for another round of the selection process. The cancer cells after the second round were named mtMDA (highly bone-metastatic MDA). Flow cytometry with anti-human &#x003b2;2-microglobulin showed that the mtMDA cells were human and homogeneous (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), demonstrating that these cells were a subline of the MDA cells. Interestingly, microcomputed tomographic (&#x003bc;CT) analyses revealed more severe bone destruction in mice during the second round of selection than during the first round (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Because this bone phenotype indicated that the mtMDA cells might be more osteolytic than the MDA cells, we compared the effects of the two cell types on osteoclastogenesis of mouse primary cells. Conditioned media (CM) prepared from mtMDA and MDA cells were added to pre-osteoclasts generated by priming bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) with RANKL. The CM from mtMDA cells increased the number of mature tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive (TRAP<sup>+</sup>) multinucleated cells (osteoclasts) and the osteoclast surface area compared with the CM from MDA cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Since RANKL is an essential factor for osteoclastogenesis, we next tested whether osteoprotegerin (OPG), a decoy receptor of RANKL, could block the effect of the cancer cell CM. Surprisingly, OPG reduced osteoclast numbers by only 27.7%&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.14% in the culture with mtMDA CM and 49.3%&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;14.10% in the culture with MDA CM (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>), indicating that RANKL was not the sole factor responsible for the stimulatory effect of these cancer cells on osteoclastogenesis.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Bone-metastatic breast cancer cells induce osteolysis and stimulate osteoclastogenesis. <bold>a</bold> Flow cytometry with anti-human &#x003b2;2-microglobulin antibody verified mtMDA as human cells.

Among the genes that were highly differentially expressed, the signal for S100A4 was 134.68-fold higher in the MDA than in the MCF7 cell line (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Furthermore, a search of NCBI GEO microarray data sets of tumor samples from 65 breast cancer patients (GSE 14020) revealed a significantly higher expression of S100A4 in bone-metastasized tumors than in tumors metastasized to other organs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Using quantitative real-time PCR analyses, we confirmed a markedly higher level of S100A4 mRNA in the MDA cell line than in the MCF7 cell line. The S100A4 mRNA level was even higher in the mtMDA cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). A similar pattern was detected in intracellular S100A4 protein levels (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). We next examined S100A4 secretion by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) specific for human S100A4 protein with CM from cancer cells. The S100A4 concentration was 3.33-fold higher in mtMDA CM than in MDA CM, and MCF7 CM contained a negligible amount of S100A4 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). Next, we explored the relationship between S100A4 levels in these cancer cells and the osteoclastogenic effects of cancer cell CM. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>, MDA CM and mtMDA CM increased osteoclast formation by 2.9- and 6.2-fold, respectively, compared with MCF7 CM (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>). Collectively, these results indicated that bone-metastasized breast cancer cells have high levels of S100A4 gene expression and protein secretion and that S100A4 secretion may be associated with cancer-induced osteoclastogenesis.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>S100A4 expression and secretion is elevated in mtMDA cells. <bold>a</bold> A cDNA microarray revealed a higher signal intensity of S100A2, 3, and 4 in MDA than in MCF7 cells. <bold>b</bold> Human S100A4 signals retrieved from GSE 14020 of the GEO database from 65 breast cancer patients with the indicated sites of metastases. <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;18 (bone), 20 (lung), 22 (brain), and 5 (liver). **<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01 by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc Bonferroni test. <bold>c</bold> Real-time PCR analyses showed S100A4 mRNA expression in MDA and mtMDA but not in MCF7 cells. <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3 per group. ***<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001 by one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey&#x02019;s test. <bold>d</bold> Western blot analyses showed that S100A4 protein expression was significantly higher in mtMDA than in MDA cells. <bold>e</bold> Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with conditioned media (CM) revealed the highest amount of S100A4 secretion from mtMDA and no secretion from MCF7. <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3 per group. ***<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001 by one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey&#x02019;s test. <bold>f</bold> CM from mtMDA, MDA, and MCF7 stimulated osteoclast formation in decreasing order. <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5 per group. ***<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001 by one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey&#x02019;s test.

To this end, we knocked down S100A4 in mtMDA cells by lentiviral transduction of shRNA. A successful reduction in S100A4 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels was verified by real-time PCR analyses and western blotting of whole-cell lysates (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Western blot and ELISA analyses of culture supernatants showed an effective decrease in S100A4 secretion from the knockdown cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). We then tested the effect of CM from these cells on osteoclastogenesis. The CM from control knockdown cells (mtMDA-Csh) increased osteoclastogenesis as did mtMDA CM, while the CM from S100A4 knockdown cells (mtMDA-S100A4sh) had only a weak effect (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>).

S100A4 increased the formation of TRAP<sup>+</sup> multinucleated cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Consistently, the mRNA expression of osteoclast differentiation marker genes such as MMP2/9, Acp5 (TRAP), cathepsin K (CtsK), DC-stamp, and Atp6v0d2 was significantly increased by S100A4 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). The mRNA and protein levels of c-Fos and NFATc1, key transcription factors for osteoclastogenesis, were also increased (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b, c</xref>). In addition, direct administration of rS100A4 protein onto mouse calvariae elicited calvarial bone lysis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>) and increased the percentage of osteoclast surface per bone surface (Oc.S/BS; Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>).

In addition, the S100A4-dependent increase in p65 in nuclear fractions was inhibited in RAGE knockdown cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). Confocal microscopy also showed that S100A4 increased the percentage of cells with nuclear p65 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>).

The noncanonical NF-&#x003ba;B, RelB, and p52 were not activated by S100A4 (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>). RAGE knockdown negated the effect of S100A4 on p65 NF-&#x003ba;B activity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>).

This secretion seems to be responsible for the stimulation of osteoclastogenesis by mtMDA because adding neutralizing Ab to the CM or shRNA-mediated gene knockdown in cancer cells nullified the stimulatory effect. In corroboration, treatment with rS100A4 protein increased osteoclast formation and bone resorption both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, in vivo injection of mtMDA-S100A4sh cells led to less osteolysis than injection of mtMDA-Csh. Moreover, a S100A4-blocking Ab attenuated mtMDA-induced bone loss in vivo.

Among the tumor-derived factors, PTHrP is the most extensively studied. The role of PTHrP in bone metastasis is multifaceted; the autocrine action of PTHrP promotes the proliferation, survival, invasion, and migration of tumor cells, while the paracrine and endocrine action of PTHrP modulates bone-metastatic environments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> The primary mechanism by which PTHrP modulates the bone microenvironment seems to be indirect stimulation of osteoclastogenesis via induction of RANKL in osteoblasts and osteocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> This indirect mode of action appears to be distinct from the direct stimulation of osteoclastogenesis by S100A4 in our present study. However, S100A4 may have a dual function: directly acting on pre-osteoclasts via RAGE and indirectly functioning via RANKL induction in osteoblasts. In support of this notion, we observed upregulation of RANKL by S100A4 in mouse calvarial osteoblasts (data not shown). This type of dual action has also been reported with interleukin 8, levels of which correlate with increased bone metastasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> In the vicious cycle model of bone metastasis, PTHrP secretion from tumor cells is further stimulated by bone-latent factors, such as TGF-&#x003b2;, released upon matrix resorption by osteoclasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> Whether S100A4 stimulation of osteoclasts would lead to further induction of S100A4 in tumor cells, forming another type of vicious cycle in bone-metastatic environments, is a question to be resolved.</p><p id="Par16">Recently, modified views of our understanding of tumor bone metastasis have added dormancy and reactivation stages prior to the vicious cycle stage between tumor cells and osteoclasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> Because osteoclasts may also have a role in the reactivation process, it would be intriguing to investigate the role of S100A4 in the regulation of dormancy induction or reactivation of breast cancer cells in the bone-metastatic niche. The interplay between tumor cells and stroma was suggested to enhance S100A4 secretion, which leads to modulation of the tumor microenvironment via stimulation of angiogenesis and MMP activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> In addition, infiltration of immune cells, including macrophages and T cells, is an important factor in the metastatic niche, and S100A4 was shown to be crucial to the recruitment of T cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> In support of the role of S100A4 in modulating the niche where immune cells participate, a S100A4-neutralizing Ab was shown to suppress T cell recruitment and premetastatic niche formation, inhibiting lung metastasis of mouse mammary carcinoma cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> Because macrophages can serve as precursors of osteoclasts, increased S100A4 levels in the bone-metastatic niche may recruit osteoclast precursors on one hand and stimulate osteoclast differentiation, as demonstrated in our study, on the other hand, in bone metastasis. Tumor-released S100A4 may stimulate stromal components such as osteoblast-lineage cells to mediate their interplay with osteoclasts, driving the microenvironment favorable for reactivation and growth of breast cancer cells in the bone-metastatic niche.</p><p id="Par17">In addition to promoting tumor growth and dissemination in various types of murine and human cancers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> S100A4 was shown to stimulate invasion and migration by adjusting the extracellular matrix, cell membrane fluidity, and the cytoskeleton of murine melanoma cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> When we compared cell proliferation, migration, and invasion between mtMDA and parental MDA cells, mtMDA cells displayed greater migration and invasion than did MDA cells with no difference in proliferation (data not shown). In addition, S100A4 knockdown in mtMDA cells decreased migration or invasion in vitro (data not shown). These effects on migration and invasion may be derived from the intracellular function of S100A4 or the autocrine action of secreted S100A4. Under in vivo conditions, secreted S100A4 may also influence neighboring cells and matrix in a paracrine way during the process of dissemination and establishment in a distant site. Our in vivo model of intracardiac injection of tumor cells showed that the tumor burden was decreased in mice that received mtMDA-S100A4sh compared to mice injected with mtMDA-Csh (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). This effect on bone metastatic incidence may be in part attributed to cell-intrinsic differences. However, injection of the cancer cells directly into bone also resulted in a lower cancer mass in mtMDA-S100A4sh-injected mice than in mtMDA-Csh-injected mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>), suggesting that cancer-derived S100A4 modulates the bone microenvironment to support cancer cell growth. The function of S100A4 in the metastasis of breast cancer is not limited to bone. S100A4 expression was also increased in breast cancer that metastasized to lung, brain, and liver (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Moreover, several studies have reported that S100A4 regulates breast cancer cell migration to other organs in animal models. In a study by Wang et al., knockdown of S100A4 was shown to inhibit lung metastasis of MDA-MB-231 cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> and a study by Liu et al. reported that recombinant S100A4 promoted migration of 4T1 mouse breast cancer cells to the lung, liver, and kidney.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> Therefore, S100A4 is an attractive therapeutic target for the metastasis of breast cancers to multiple organs, including bone.</p><p id="Par18">S100A4 has been shown to utilize cell surface receptors, including RAGE, TLR4, CD44, and annexin 2, in diverse cell types.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> In particular, RAGE has been implicated in the metastasis of several types of cancers, including lung, brain, and prostate cancer and osteosarcoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> Here we demonstrated that RAGE served as the receptor for S100A4 in stimulating osteoclastogenesis. Intriguingly, RAGE knockout mice displayed an osteopetrotic phenotype due to defects in osteoclast maturation and function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) was suggested as a ligand of RAGE in support of osteoclastogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> In addition, the HMGB1&#x02013;RAGE interaction has been shown to have significant roles in the metastasis of lung and brain cancers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> However, our microarray analysis showed that HMGB1 expression was lower in MDA cells than in MCF7 cells, suggesting that HMGB1 is unlikely to contribute to the osteoclastogenesis occurring in breast cancer metastasis. In conclusion, targeting the S100A4&#x02013;RAGE interaction is a valid approach for inhibiting the bone destruction caused by breast cancer metastasis.</p><p id="Par19">In our previous study, we found that rS100A4 treatment inhibited the matrix mineralizing activity of osteoblasts via the NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> Consequently, S100A4 from bone metastases will drive highly catabolic bone metabolism as a result of impaired osteoblast function and enhanced osteoclast activity. Owing to the dual action of S100A4 on osteoblasts and osteoclasts, measures to block S100A4 function, such as the mAb developed in our study, could lead to effective bone mass accrual. Thus targeting S100A4 may be ideal in conditions of severe bone loss such as metastasis-induced osteolysis. In addition, S100A4 does not seem to play a critical role in normal physiology. Its expression is restricted in normal adult tissues, and S100A4 knockout mice displayed no evident abnormalities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> In contrast, S100A4 expression is highly upregulated in disease states such as tissue fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer. These aspects make S100A4 an attractive molecular target for the development of therapeutics with minimal adverse effects. To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate the role of tumor-derived S100A4 in metastasis-associated osteoclastogenesis and the first to project the concept of blocking S100A4 as an effective strategy in the treatment of cancer-induced bone destruction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Establishment of the mtMDA cell line</title><p id="Par20">For establishment of a highly bone-metastatic mtMDA cell line, in vivo selection was performed as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> MDA-MB-231 cells (MDA; 1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup>) in 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;L phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were injected into the left ventricle of 9-week-old female BALB/c-nude mice using a 1-mL syringe with a 26-G needle.

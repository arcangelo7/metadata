and plasma levels of creatine kinase-muscle/brain (CK-MB), troponin I, and
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass
grafting (CABG).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This is a double-blind randomized clinical trial study. Fifty patients (50-80
years old) who had CABG surgery were selected. The intervention group
received 5 g of intravenous vitamin C before anesthesia induction and 5 g of
vitamin C in cardioplegic solution. The control group received the same
amount of placebo (normal saline). Arterial blood samples were taken to
determine the serum levels of CK-MB, troponin I, and LDH enzymes. Left
ventricular ejection fraction was measured and hemodynamic parameters were
recorded at intervals.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>High doses of vitamin C in the treatment group led to improvement of
ventricular function (ejection fraction [EF]) and low Intensive Care Unit
(ICU) stay. The cardiac enzymes level in the vitamin C group was lower than
in the control group. These changes were not significant between the groups
in different time intervals (anesthesia induction, end of bypass, 6 h after
surgery, and 24 h after surgery) for CK-MB, LDH, and troponin I. Hemodynamic
parameters, hematocrit, potassium, urinary output, blood transfusion,
arrhythmia, and inotropic support showed no significant difference between
the groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Vitamin C has significantly improved the patients&#x02019; ventricular function (EF)
72 h after surgery and reduced the length of ICU stay. No significant
changes in cardiac biomarkers, including CK-MB, troponin I, and LDH, were
seen over time in each group.</p></sec><sec><title>IRCT code</title><p>IRCT2016053019470N33</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cardioplegic Solutions</kwd><kwd>Stroke Volume</kwd><kwd>Coronary Artery Bypass</kwd><kwd>Ventricular Function</kwd><kwd>Arrhythmias, Cardiac</kwd><kwd>Biomarkers</kwd><kwd>Vitamins</kwd><kwd>Ascorbic Acid</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><table-wrap id="t6" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="4%" span="1"/><col width="44%" span="1"/><col width="4%" span="1"/><col width="4%" span="1"/><col width="44%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" style="background-color:#e6e7e8" rowspan="1">Abbreviations,

grafting (CABG) surgery, can cause inflammatory reactions<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. The harmful effect of CBP can be produced by free
oxygen radicals<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. During ischemia
and reperfusion, the free radicals of oxygen affect the mitochondria, sarcoplasm,
vascular endothelial cells, adenosine, and nitric oxide (NO), causing an undesirable
effect. This effect increases the damage to the myocardium by arrhythmia, impaired
contractions, and necrosis<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. The
systemic release of free radicals during CPB disrupts the reperfusion process of the
ischemic heart and causes a secondary damage to the myocardium<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>On the other hand, the production of free oxygen radicals leads to the use of main
antioxidants. The plasma concentration of vitamin C decreases by approximately 70%
in all subjects under CPB within 24 hours after surgery, and this decrease persists
in most patients for up to two weeks. Therefore, the serious reduction of vitamin C
leads to destruction of the body&#x02019;s defense against activated oxygen species produced
during cardiac surgery<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Studies have shown that the ascorbic acid acts as a free radical scavenger to reduce
the lipid peroxidation in the cell membrane and effectively protects from myocardial
damage against ischemic reperfusion, by removing the free radicals during and after
surgery<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Myocardial injury (MI) and myocardial infarction during the surgery are determined by
measuring serum myocardial necrosis indices, such as creatine kinase-muscle/brain
(CK-MB), troponin I, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Cell membrane damage causes
these cardiac markers to spread to the bloodstream<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Regarding the mentioned issues, free radicals of oxygen are considered as the main
cause of myocardial reperfusion ischemic injury in patients under CPB, which
increases the myocardial damage, by arrhythmias, impaired contractions, and
necrosis. Studies have been conducted to find and remove free radicals and protect
the myocardium, including strengthening the antioxidant defense, which may help to
protect tissues from reperfusion damage in surgical procedures under CPB. Vitamin C
reduces free radicals, as an antioxidant, and may play an important role in reducing
cardiac enzymes and postoperative complications. Our main objective in this study
was to evaluate the effect of high doses of vitamin C on plasma levels of CK-MB,
troponin I, and LDH (after CABG) and the cardiac protective effect of vitamin C.
Also, the incidence of arrhythmia and the patients&#x02019; hemodynamic symptoms have been
investigated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>This is a double-blind randomized clinical trial study. The study was approved by the
Ethics Committee of the Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (No. 10263). Fifty
patients, males and females, with the age range of 50-80 years and who had CABG
surgery were selected using a simple sampling method for the study. The inclusion
criteria were: patients who referred to Shiraz hospitals for undergoing CABG and who
signed the written consent for the participation in the study. The exclusion
criteria were: history of arrhythmias, ejection fraction (EF) &#x0003c; 30%, severe renal
or hepatic failure, permanent or temporary pacemaker, treatment with antiarrhythmic
drugs and digoxin, presence of a degree of atrioventricular block (AV-block) or
bradycardia with a rate of &#x0003c; 50 per minute, history of recent myocardial
infarction (less than a month), high initial troponin I level, and history of redo
or complex (valve replacement + CABG) surgery. Left ventricular ejection fraction
(LVEF) was measured by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Sample selection was
done using a block randomization method. A demographic information form was
completed for the patient.</p><p>Patients in group A received 5 g of intravenous vitamin C before induction of
anesthesia and 5 g of vitamin C in the cardioplegic solution. Patients in group B,
as control group, were given the same amount of placebo (normal saline). Arterial
blood samples were taken at the following intervals to determine the serum levels of
CK-MB, troponin I, and LDH: during induction of anesthesia, at the end of CABG, six
hours after surgery, and 24 hours after surgery. In all patients, blood samples were
taken before the injection of vitamin C or placebo and considered as baseline.
Hemodynamics of patients, including systolic and diastolic pressures, mean arterial
pressure, and heart rate, were recorded at specified intervals.</p><p>The method of anesthesia was the same in all patients. The induction of general
anesthesia was done by midazolam (0.1-0.2 mg/kg), fentanyl (5-10 &#x000b5;g/kg),
sodium thiopental (1-3 mg/kg), and pancuronium bromide (0.1 mg/kg) and it was
maintained with propofol (50-100 &#x000b5;g/kg/min), remifentanil (0.1-0.2
&#x000b5;g/kg/min), and oxygen and nitrous oxide (50%/50%). After the sternotomy and
separation of the graft (right or left internal mammary artery [LIMA], saphenous
vein, and radial artery), following the administration of heparin, at a dose of 300
u/kg and achieving activated clotting time (ACT) up to 400 seconds, the aortic and
right atrium cannulation was performed by the surgeon and CPB pump was used. After
the patient's aortic clamping, a cold blood cardioplegic solution containing 5 g of
vitamin C or placebo was injected, respectively, into group A and group B patients,
through a cardioplegia cannula and using antegrade techniques. The cardioplegia used
was the same in all patients, with the combination of blood and hypothermic
crystalloid, and it was repeated every 20 minutes. At the same time, patients were
cooled down to 32-34 &#x000b0;C. The surgical technique was the same in all patients and it
was performed by the same surgeon. In all cases, LIMA and saphenous vein were used
in CABG.</p><p>Anastomosis of the distal grafts (on the heart) was performed by the surgeon in
patients in cardiac arrest. According to the surgeon opinion, the patients started
to warm up, and after aortic declamping, any arrhythmia, such as irregular rhythm
and rate (premature ventricular contracture, premature atrial contracture,
ventricular tachycardia, atrial or ventricular fibrillation, asystole, bundle branch
blocks), the time, and the method of intervention for the treatment of arrhythmia
(lidocaine and amiodarone injection, shock) were recorded in the checklist. The rate
of reception and the number of inotropic drugs prescribed for heart rehabilitation
were also recorded. After proximal anastomosis on the aorta, the end of bypass is
announced. Separation of patients from the CPB was based on the standard protocol,
including the appropriate left ventricular filling pressure and proper hemodynamic
using liquid and vasoactive drugs administration. Inotropic drugs were administered
based on hemodynamic and underlying conditions of the patient. Epinephrine and
dopamine were the first line inotropes to support the heart. At the end, after the
patient's separation from the CPB pump, for heparin reversal, protamine sulfate was
given to patients at a rate of 50 mg per 5000 units of heparin and ACT was checked
again. After insertion of the chest tube and examination of the patient in terms of
hemorrhage and hemostasis, in sternum, subcutaneous tissue, and sutured skin,
patients were transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and, after stable
hemodynamic conditions, isolated from the ventilator in the ICU. The level of
biochemical markers and the hemodynamic changes in the patient, the type and
treatment of arrhythmia, and the time and number of inotropes were also recorded at
six hours after surgery and 24 hours after surgery.</p><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Data was analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS)
software version 24. Qualitative variables were represented by number and
percentage. Quantitative variables with normal distribution were represented
with mean and standard deviation (mean &#x000b1; SD), and quantitative variables
with abnormal distribution with median and interquartile range (median [IQR]).
To test the normality, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used. For comparison of the
variables between the two groups according to the need, Student t-test,
Mann-Whitney U test, and chi-square test and repeated measure were used. The
values are significant when <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the patients&#x02019; demographic data

bypass, six hours after surgery, and 24 hours after surgery) were measured and
recorded. The values of each of the three biochemical markers at all times in the
control group were greater than those of the treatment group. Data analysis was done
in two ways: (1) comparison of changes in biochemical markers over time in each
group and (2) comparing biochemical markers changes between the two groups in
general and then at each time.</p><p>In the comparison of CK-MB enzymes over time in each group, the CK-MB levels from the
first to the second time showed a sharp increase in both groups, there was a slow
decrease from the third to the fourth time in the treatment group, whereas in the
control group, after a slow decrease, the enzyme levels increased again. These
changes were significant over time in each group (<italic>P</italic>=0.0001). In
comparing the two times in each group, the first time showed a significant
difference from the three other times (<italic>P</italic>=0.0001) and it indicates a
significant increase in the enzyme during and after surgery, but the second, third,
and fourth times have only significant difference from the first time, but not from
other times (<italic>P</italic>=1). The comparison of CK-MB enzymes changes between
the two groups reveals that the overall comparison between the two groups did not
show statistically significant differences (<italic>P</italic>=0.27). Therefore, the
enzyme values were evaluated in each time in two groups and there was no significant
difference between the two groups (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05).</p><p>In the comparison of troponin I changes over time within the groups, the treatment
group was steadily increasing until the second time, and thereafter until the fourth
time, there is a slow increase in the amount of troponin I. But in the control
group, there is a rapid and steady increase in all times. These changes are
significant in each group (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). In comparing two different
times in each group, troponin I changes were significant between the first time and
the second and third times (<italic>P</italic>=0.0001) and the fourth time
(<italic>P</italic>=0.001), therefore there is a significant increase in the
level of troponin I during and after surgery. The second, third, and fourth times
showed a significant difference only from the first; no significant difference was
showed from other times (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05). The comparison of troponin I
changes between the groups showed no significant difference
(<italic>P</italic>=0.35). Also, the comparison of troponin I values in each of the
four study times didn&#x02019;t show significant differences between the two groups
(<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05).</p><p>In the comparison of LDH enzymes over time in each group, from the first to the
second time LDH was slowly increased in both groups and from the second to the third
time, there was a great and fast increase and the increase in the control group was
faster and bigger than in the treatment group. From the third to the fourth time,
both groups had the same increase. Similarly to other enzymes, changes over time
were significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). Comparison of two times in each group
showed that the first time had a relatively significant relationship with the second
time (<italic>P</italic>=0.057). And with the third and fourth times, it was
completely significant (<italic>P</italic>=0.0001). The third and fourth times
didn&#x02019;t show significant changes (<italic>P</italic>=0.87). The comparison of LDH
enzyme changes between the two groups showed no significant statistical difference
(<italic>P</italic>=0.09) and also the amount of LDH enzyme was not
statistically different at any time between two groups (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05)

comparing with the treatment group, decreased, and this difference was statistically
significant (<italic>P</italic>=0.002). Also, the EF changes variable, which
indicates changes in EF from preoperative time to 72 hours after surgery, was
compared in both groups. The results indicate that the EF of the treatment group
experienced an increase of 0.8% and the control group experienced a decrease of 4.2%
(<italic>P</italic>=0.009). These results show statistically significant
differences in EF changes during 72 hours after operation between the two groups
(<xref rid="t4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).</p><p>The length of ICU stay in both groups was compared. The results showed that the
patients in the treatment group were hospitalized for a shorter time in the ICU than
those in the control group, which was statistically significant
(<italic>P</italic>=0.012) (<xref rid="t4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).</p><p>The urinary output of both groups of patients was measured in three times, before the
onset of bypass (time 1), at the end of bypass (time 2), and 24 hours after surgery
(time 3). The results show that the amount of urine output in patients was increased
at the end of the pump until 24 hours after the surgery, and these changes were the
same between the two groups. Although changes in time are significant, regardless of
being in the treatment or control group (<italic>P</italic>=0.0001), there are no
significant differences between the two groups (<italic>P</italic>=0.34).</p><p>Plasma levels of hemoglobin and potassium were measured at four-time intervals:
anesthesia induction time, bypass termination, six hours after surgery, and 24 hours
after surgery. The results did not show any significant difference between the
treatment and control groups. Hemoglobin levels from the first to the second time,
the end of bypass, showed a sharp decline, but increased in 24 hours after surgery
in both groups. But these changes are not statistically significant between the two
groups (<italic>P</italic>=0.89). Blood potassium levels in both groups increased by
up to six hours postoperatively and decreased in 24 hours after surgery, and
although these changes in all patients were meaningful over time
(<italic>P</italic>=0.0001), there was no significant difference between the two
groups (<italic>P</italic>=0.85).</p><p>Comparison of hemodynamic parameters, including systolic and diastolic blood
pressures and heart rate, in both groups in the four mentioned times showed that
until the third time (six hours after surgery), a decrease in blood pressure was
observed, and thereafter a relative increase was detected. These changes are
significant over time, but they are not statistically different between the two
groups (<italic>P</italic>=0.58, <italic>P</italic>=0.91). Also, the heart rate of
patients in the control group was lower than of those in the treatment group, and
patients in both groups had the highest and the lowest heart rate in six and 24
hours after surgery, respectively. These changes were significant over time
(<italic>P</italic>=0.004), but no significant differences were observed between

cardioplegia solution, on the MI injury in 50 candidates for coronary artery bypass
surgery were evaluated.</p><p>During ischemia, the disruption of the cell membrane integrity leads to release of
calcium and phospholipid A2 and formation of polyunsaturated fatty acids and fatty
acid radicals<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. Thus, cells can
release oxygen-derived free radicals and proteolytic enzymes, and these materials
damage the cells containing deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), proteins, and
lipids<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>. Vitamin C has
the ability of scavenging free radicals. This vitamin has cardioprotective
properties, which were demonstrated to reduce oxidative damage in diabetic rats and
during ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-injury<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>. In some
studies, vitamin C improved myocardial stunning and enhanced left ventricular
function<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>. Also,
vitamin C inhibits the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS) in
endothelial cells and neuronal nitric oxide synthetase (nNOS), and thereby reduces
the level of NO in plasma, that is responsible for the guanylate cyclase activation,
which counteracts the effects of vasoconstrictors. This might maintain the vascular
resistance and baroreceptor reflex and, as a result, the mean arterial pressure
could also be maintained<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The focus of this study was to evaluate the effect of vitamin C on the plasma levels
of CK-MB, troponin I, and LDH in four-time intervals (before anesthesia induction,
at bypass termination, at six hours after surgery, and at 24 hours after surgery) in
treatment and control groups. The results showed that the changes in the levels of
all three cardiovascular biomedical markers over time in each group were significant
within the group. CK-MB and troponin I changes were significant only between the
first time and the three other times, indicating a significant increase in the
cardiac biomarkers during and after the surgery. Also, in the LDH enzyme levels, the
difference between the first time and the second time was relatively significant and
the difference was quietly significant between the first and the third and fourth
times. However, in comparing between the two groups, although the level of enzymes
in the control group was always greater than in the treatment group, the difference
was not significant between the groups. There was no significant difference between
the two groups in each of the four study times. In the Oktar et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> study, the CK-MB level was lower
in vitamin C group than in the control group. In another study, by Dingchao et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>, the levels of CK-MB
and LDH were higher in the control group after surgery than in the vitamin C group.
In Lee et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> study, troponin
I and LDH levels were lower in the treatment group than in the control group, but
similarly to our study, the level of CK-MB was not significantly different. On the
other hand, the outcome of this study is consistent with the study by Westhuyzen et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>, where the
pre-operation administration of supplements of vitamins C and E did not have a
significant effect on myocardial damage and the level of CK-MB enzyme. Also, Gao et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> found out that the
administration of 1 mM of vitamin C alone did not reduce post-ischemic injury, but
coadministration with glutathione increased the protective effects of glutathione.
All of these studies have different conditions, doses, and administration methods
(intravenous, oral, mixed with a cardio-polycarbamide solution), and perhaps the
reason for the different results is related to these variations.</p><p>In studies with a high dose of vitamin C<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>, the level of
cardiac biomarkers was clearly reduced. In our study, at all times, with any
reduction or increase process, the level of biomedical markers in the treatment
group was lower than in the control group and this shows the clinical effect of
vitamin C on reducing the levels of ischemic enzymes, but there was no statistically
significant difference between the two groups, which may be due to a low sample size
or a significant increase in biomedical markers at all intervals, especially from
the first to the second time, which resulted in large dispersion of data and
increased the SD, and the difference between the two groups was not significant. It
is expected that by increasing the sample size or using longer intervals, the
difference becomes statistically significant.</p><p>In this study, high doses of vitamin C were injected intravenously and in a
cardioplegic solution in patients undergoing CABG surgery. According to the results,
the significant decrease of all three biomarkers after the onset of the
cardiopulmonary pump is clear.</p><p>The comparison between EF values showed an increase in EF in the control group within
72 hours after the operation, and this difference was significant. Also, the
variable EF changes, which indicates the changes in EF before and after the
operation, well demonstrates this difference. The percentage of EF in the vitamin C
group showed 0.8 of increase and in the control group, it showed 0.4 of decrease.
Therefore, it seems that vitamin C has been effective in improving the function of
the left ventricle and the heart because patients receiving vitamin C have a better
contractile power than those in the control group after 72 hours. This result is
consistent with the study by Mak and Newton, which revealed that vitamin C has also
enhanced the response of the left ventricle to the inotropic drugs, which improves
left ventricular contraction<sup>[<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The length of ICU stay in patients receiving vitamin C was shorter than in those from
the control group, and this difference was significant. Although the hospital stay
and intubation time were shorter in the vitamin C group than in the control group,
there were no significant differences between these two items in the two groups.
This is consistent with the result of the study by Dinqchao et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>, in which the patients had shorter
ICU stay and hospital stay than the control group. Also, in Rezk et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> study, patients in the vitamin C
group had shorter length of ICU stay than those in the control group.</p><p>There was no significant difference in the need for blood transfusion between the two
groups. In fact, vitamin C seems to have no effect on reducing the need for blood in
patients who have received it.</p><p>Regarding the need for inotrope support 24 hours after surgery in both groups and the
number and hours of drug intake, vitamin C seems to have no effect on the need for
inotropic drugs during the postoperative period. This conclusion is consistent with
the study by Oktar et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The urinary output rate was measured before the onset of bypass until 24 hours
postoperatively. The changes in both groups were similar over time, and the patients
receiving vitamin C did not differ in the level of urinary output from those in the
control group. The comparison of plasma levels of hemoglobin and potassium in the
four periods, before the onset of the bypass until 24 hours after surgery, did not
show any significant difference between the two groups. The changes made over time
between the treatment and control groups had the same trend and vitamin C had no
effect on this process.</p><p>Hemodynamic parameters, including systolic and diastolic blood pressures and heart
rate, were compared in four-time intervals between patients from treatment and
control groups. Blood pressure changes in both groups increased and decreased
significantly, and no significant difference was observed. There was also a slight
improvement in heart rate in the treatment group, but there was no statistically
significant difference. Therefore, the vitamin C intervention did not have a clear
effect on hemodynamic conditions in patients. These results are similar to the ones
from Mak and Neutron study<sup>[<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>. In
another study by Jouybar et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>, ascorbic acid had no significant effect on hemodynamic
parameters, such as systolic and diastolic blood pressures and heart rate. But in
the study by Lee et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>, mean
arterial blood pressure was better in the vitamin C group than in the control group,
but the patients&#x02019; heart rate showed no difference between the two groups.</p><p>In this study, we monitored the incidence of arrhythmias before the onset of the
bypass up to 24 hours after surgery in five intervals. Type and treatment of
arrhythmias between the two groups did not differ significantly. The highest
incidence of arrhythmias was observed at the time of aortic clamp removal, which was
similar in the treatment and control groups. Compared to the control group, no
significant changes were observed in the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias during and
after operation. Vitamin C seems to have no effect on reducing the incidence of
cardiac rhythm disturbances in patients. The result of this study is consistent with
the ones from the study by Oktar et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>. However, in the study by Rebrova et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup>, it was determined that vitamin C
prevents cardiac rhythm disturbances 24 hours after surgery, that the use of vitamin
C with beta blockers is recommended after bypass surgery to prevent arrhythmias, and
it also suggested the use of vitamin C in patients with advanced heart disease. In
the present study, patients have no acute underlying problems, such as severe
cardiac arrhythmias, MI, very low EF, etc., and they were undergone surgery in a
relatively stable general condition, and this may be a reason for ignoring the
effect of vitamin C in preventing cardiac arrhythmias.</p><sec><title>Limitation</title><p>This study was performed on a limited number of patients and it is recommended to
perform studies with larger sample sizes than this and in different countries,
so the results could be applicable throughout the world.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Vitamin C has significantly improved the ventricular function (EF) of patients 72 h
after surgery and reduced the length of ICU stay.</p><p>No significant changes in cardiac biomarkers including CK-MB, troponin I, and LDH
were seen over time in each group. For future researches, longer intervals (48 and
72 hours after surgery) or higher sample sizes are recommended. The combination of
vitamin C with other antioxidants or their comparison can more accurately reveal its
influence on prevention of coronary heart disease and reduction of cardiac
biomarkers.</p><table-wrap id="t7" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="5%" span="1"/><col width="95%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NE</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Substantial contributions to the

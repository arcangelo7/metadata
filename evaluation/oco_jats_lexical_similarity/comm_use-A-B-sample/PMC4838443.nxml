Urinary C-peptide creatinine ratio (UCPCR) measures endogenous insulin production.

According to UK guidelines, 66 patients had type 1 diabetes by these criteria, however 37 of these (56%) had a UCPCR of &#x0003e;0.2 nmol/mmol and so, by gold standard criteria, had type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Those misclassified as having type 1 diabetes were older than those correctly classified (median age 44 years [interquartile range {IQR} 30&#x02013;59 years] versus 20 years [IQR 11&#x02013;30 years], <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.001) and had a higher BMI at diagnosis (26.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup> [IQR 23&#x02013;30.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>] versus 21.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup> [IQR 18.9&#x02013;25.4kg/m<sup>2</sup>], <italic>P</italic> = 0.002) (data not shown).</p><p>In contrast, those who were insulin deficient but were incorrectly classified by UK guidelines as having type 2 diabetes commenced insulin treatment more quickly than those correctly classified as having type 2 diabetes (time to insulin from diagnosis 12 months [IQR 2&#x02013;18 months]) versus 84 months [IQR 42&#x02013;138 months], <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.001), had lower BMI (22.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> [IQR 21.1&#x02013;26.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>] versus 28.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup> [IQR 25.4&#x02013;33.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>], <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.001), and were younger at diagnosis (44 years [IQR 35&#x02013;56 years] versus 51 years [IQR 43&#x02013;59 years], <italic>P</italic>= 0.014).</p></sec><sec><title>Optimal clinical criteria</title><p>ROC curves were used to examine the discriminative ability of key clinical criteria: time to insulin, age at diagnosis, BMI at diagnosis, and BMI at recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

On the basis of the ROC curve data, the optimal cut-offs for time to insulin (12 months), age at diagnosis (39 years), BMI at diagnosis (23.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), and recruitment (28.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were incorporated into modified criteria in various combinations to see whether they improved diagnostic accuracy. Aiming for a sensitivity and specificity of &#x0003e;80% (equivalent to an ROC AUC of &#x0003e;0.8), none were superior to the UK guidelines as improvements in sensitivity led to greater decreases in specificity and vice versa.</p><p>The best-performing alternative was the combination of an age cut-off of 39 years and time to insulin of 12 months; this improved the correct classification of those with type 2 diabetes to 94%, but reduced to 78.3% those correctly classified with type 1 diabetes. In general, adding BMI at diagnosis or time of recruitment improved the proportion of those with type 2 diabetes that were correctly classified, but markedly reduced the proportion correctly classified with type 1 diabetes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Summary</title><p>The study results show that the UK guidelines are an accurate method of predicting long-term endogenous insulin production and perform well in correctly classifying patients with insulin-treated diabetes based on the development of absolute insulin deficiency using endogenous insulin levels and time to insulin from diagnosis. This supports the guidelines&#x02019; use as a beneficial, pragmatic way of classifying patients. When all patients with diabetes are considered, the authors hypothesise that the performance of the UK guidelines will be even better because the vast majority of patients who are not treated with insulin will be correctly classified as having type 2 diabetes.</p><p>Patients diagnosed at an older age (&#x02265;35 years) in whom insulin treatment commenced at diagnosis are at the highest risk of being misclassified when using the UK guidelines.</p><p>In clinical practice, emphasis is often placed on BMI to help differentiate between type 1 and type 2 diabetes but the study findings presented here indicate that, among patients treated with insulin, time to insulin and age at diagnosis are better predictors of diabetes subtype than BMI. Median BMI at diagnosis of those with type 1 diabetes by the gold standard criteria was lower than in those with type 2 diabetes: 21.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup> versus 28.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.001 but the interquartile ranges overlapped (19.8&#x02013; 26.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and 25.4&#x02013;32.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). By the time of recruitment (that is, &#x02265;5 years from diagnosis), the difference in BMI between those with type 1 and type 2 diabetes was smaller (26.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> [23.1&#x02013;29.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>] versus 29.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup> [26.6&#x02013;34.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>]) although still significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.001), and the ROC AUC was low, highlighting the reduced discriminative ability of this as a clinical marker to differentiate between type 1 and 2 diabetes once the patient was receiving insulin.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This study comprised patients who had had diabetes for &#x02265;5 years. If considering all patients with diabetes, the misclassification rate of 14% is likely to be much lower: patients who are treated with tablets or diet who were diagnosed &#x02265;5 years ago are likely to have been correctly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. In patients with a diabetes duration of &#x0003c;5 years, some patients with type 1 diabetes may be still producing insulin (the &#x02018;honeymoon&#x02019; period) and not yet treated with insulin, although it is rare for patients with type 1 diabetes to be without insulin for prolonged periods. Due to recruitment locations and difficulty in recruiting Asian patients,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> the majority of the recruited patients were white European; only 30 Asian patients participated. Take-up rates in the white European population were high, and participants drawn from urban and rural populations, and thus the authors consider the results in this group are likely to be fairly representative for insulin-treated patients &#x02265;5 years from diagnosis. In comparison, the authors cannot comment on the reliability of the UK guideline criteria for populations in which the prevalence of diabetes is high; further work is needed in these groups.</p><p>Limited data on BMI were available at diagnosis, due to a combination of participants not knowing their weight at diagnosis and/or missing details in GP records in patients having been diagnosed with diabetes &#x02265;5 years ago. Improved recording of such details in those newly diagnosed with diabetes over the last few years means the authors consider this information is likely to be more available in any future studies.</p><p>The gold standard criteria used a UCPCR cut-off of 0.2 nmol/mmol, which has a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and &#x0003e;95% respectively to detect absolute insulin deficiency.<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> It is the best gold standard available in this context, being practical for use in large numbers of adults living in the community. Insulin treatment has the potential to suppress endogenous insulin,<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> but the findings presented here show that this rarely affects diabetes classification.<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> In addition, it should be noted that the small possibility of an overdiagnosis of type 1 diabetes is a safer direction of error than the opposite.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with existing literature</title><p>Previous reports on the misclassification of diabetes<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> were mainly based on contraindications in coding rather than on gold standard definitions of insulin deficiency.<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> These reports have attempted to assess accuracy of recorded diagnosis on the basis of electronically recorded data. Although this may detect patients who are miscoded, for example as having type 1 diabetes but are not on insulin 10 years postdiagnosis, it is less likely to detect patients who are misdiagnosed, for example in receiving insulin despite high endogenous insulin levels several years after diagnosis. <italic>The UK Practical Classification Guidelines for Diabetes</italic><xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> use very simple clinically available information to classify patients from scratch, and the authors have assessed their accuracy using a gold-standard diagnosis based on endogenous insulin levels and time to insulin.</p><p>A recently published systematic review identified diagnostic accuracy studies in the literature, which compared clinical criteria with C-peptide cut-offs.<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Age at diagnosis, time to insulin, and BMI are the clinical characteristics most frequently used to classify type 1 and type 2 diabetes, but few studies have addressed clearly which are most strongly associated with long-term C-peptide secretion.<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Where strength of association has been measured, time to insulin and age at diagnosis appear stronger than BMI. Again as found in the current study, combining time to insulin and age at diagnosis improved diagnostic accuracy, with BMI adding little.<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Implications for research and practice</title><p>Correct classification of type 1 and type 2 diabetes is important so the appropriate treatment and management guidelines are followed;<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> this will relate to treatment, education (for example, about dose adjustment for normal eating for those with type 1), and the monitoring of complications, all of which are based on the presence or absence of endogenous insulin.</p><p>The clinical problem facing GPs and other health professionals is that classification can be tricky at the time of diagnosis and all guidelines &#x02014; including the UK classification guidelines assessed in this study &#x02014; rely on information that is only available further down the line (for example, time to insulin). The gold standard classification using UCPCR &#x02265;5 years from diagnosis, by definition, cannot completely solve this conundrum: UCPCR of &#x0003e;0.2 nmol/mol within 5 years of diagnosis may represent someone with type 1 diabetes who is still in the &#x02018;honeymoon&#x02019; phase, or someone with type 2 diabetes; a UCPCR of &#x0003c;0.2 nmol/mmol within 5 years of diagnosis can diagnose type 1 diabetes however. Studies designed to improve classification at diagnosis, for example by using islet antibodies, are needed to address this problem.</p><p>This study has shown that the UK guidelines based on time to insulin and age at diagnosis are accurate and pragmatic for classifying patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Time to insulin is subject to many influences &#x02014; physician or patient factors, or guidelines for treatment in a particular area or patient population &#x02014; but the high rate of correlation of diagnosis with the gold standard suggests overall timing of insulin initiation may be reasonably consistent. Clinically, where the type of diabetes is unclear, giving insulin from diagnosis is a rational decision to avoid the potential consequences of untreated type 1 diabetes, such as ketoacidosis. This study however demonstrates high rates of misclassification as type 1 diabetes in those diagnosed &#x0003e;35 years of age, and thus revisiting the diagnosis in these patients may be worthwhile. The authors suggest that, if there is diagnostic uncertainty, the diagnosis be reviewed, specialist advice sought, and further investigations (for example, C-peptide and islet autoantibodies) be considered.</p><p>It could be interesting to follow up those patients identified as misclassified, and those diagnosed with type 2 and still producing insulin beyond 5 years to ascertain whether some of them may be able to withdraw successfully from insulin.</p><p>The authors have concentrated on the two main types of diabetes, but recognise that there are alternative subgroups such as genetic forms of diabetes. Although rare, these are also covered by the UK guidelines and have their own criteria for diagnosis.<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p><p>It is important that clinicians take into account other factors that may indicate these. The term &#x02018;latent autoimmune diabetes in adults&#x02019; (LADA) is sometimes proposed for adults with islet autoantibodies who eventually (&#x0003e;12 years) become severely insulin deficient, but do not require insulin for at least the first 6 months.<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> However, LADA is not included in international guidelines for classification/treatment.</p><p>Finally, nothing was found to indicate that modification of the criteria used or the cut-offs proposed would improve their diagnostic performance. This study, like others such as that of Shields <italic>et al,</italic><xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> suggest that age of diagnosis is a better clinical predictor of type 1 diabetes than BMI, which is often used clinically to determine diabetes subtype when it is not clinically obvious; this supports the fact that more emphasis should be placed on age of diagnosis in uncertain cases. This is perhaps particularly relevant in a time when the BMI of the average population is increasing.<xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></p><p>This study demonstrates that the UK Practical Classification Guidelines for Diabetes are an accurate means for differentiating between type 1 and type 2 diabetes in most instances, with time to insulin and age at diagnosis being the most discriminatory clinical characteristics. As patients aged &#x02265;35 years who were treated with insulin from diagnosis had the highest rate of misclassification (56% classed incorrectly as having type 1 diabetes), further investigation should be considered in this subgroup.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank: all the study volunteers; staff recruiting patients for this study in Northampton, Leicester, and Exeter; the retinal screening teams and local GP practices involved; and all staff at the NIHR Exeter Clinical Research Facility.</p></ack><notes><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This study was funded by (the previously existing) NHS Diabetes, with direct funding from the Department of Health (DoH), and the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) under its Research for Patient Benefit programme (PB-PG-0711-25111).

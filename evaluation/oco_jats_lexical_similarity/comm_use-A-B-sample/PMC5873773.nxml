cardiopulmonary function during cardiovascular surgery<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. Cardiopulmonary bypass
(CPB) allows this, but has complex effects. As the blood passes through the CPB
circuit and comes into contact with synthetic materials, it undergoes mechanical
insults, trauma, and cellular changes. The changes induced by these insults,
including hemolytic and inflammatory alterations, can have major clinical
implications<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. To Vieira Junior et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>,
hemolysis in CPB is a result of the passage of blood through the pump rollers or the
contact of blood with different surfaces at varying speeds. These authors noted that
the basic requirement for developing an appropriate CPB pump would be to achieve an
optimal balance between shear stress and exposure time to minimize the rate of
hemolysis. In a review of core aspects of CPB, Mota et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> posit that bypassrelated
inflammation would be caused by blood coming into contact with the operative wound
(as the surgical bed is a site of interleukin [IL] -6 release), not
with the non-endothelialized surfaces of the artificial CPB circuit. These authors
explain that many factors during CPB, some dependent on the circuit (exposure of
blood to non-physiological surfaces and conditions) and others independent (surgical
trauma, ischemia-reperfusion injury, changes in body temperature, endotoxin release)
are inflammatory response triggers. Within this context, the present study sought to
compare the incidence of hemolysis and inflammatory response in the perioperative
period of on-pump coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery performed with the two
most common types of CPB pumps, and to establish correlations among hemolytic and
inflammatory changes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>We analyzed 60 consecutive patients of either sex who underwent on-pump CABG at the
study hospital, between August 2013 and February 2014. The exclusion criteria were:
age &#x0003c; 30 or &#x0003e; 80 years; history of other cardiovascular surgery; combined
carotid surgery; preoperative anemia; patients who presented signs, symptoms and
complaints suggestive of inflammation or infection in the respiratory,
gastrointestinal, or genitourinary tract or other body systems (as detected by
history, physical examination, presence of fever, or any abnormalities in a
preoperative workup including complete blood count, C-reactive protein
[CRP], chest X-ray, and urinalysis). On the day of surgery, the 60
patients were allocated via simple random assignment to groups G1 (roller pump, n =
30) or G2 (centrifugal pump, n = 30). The present study was funded by a research
grant from the S&#x000e3;o Paulo State Research Foundation (FAPESP) and was approved
by the Research Ethics Committee of the Faculdade de Medicina de Botucatu/UNESP
(protocol CEP number 3202-2009). All patients provided written informed consent for
participation. All procedures were in accordance with the ethical standards of the
1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical
standards.</p><p>Patients were monitored continuously during the operation using a
Dixtal<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> DX2010 multi-parameter monitor. Body temperature was
monitored with an Ag-2000 nasopharyngeal probe (Braile
Biom&#x000e9;dica<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Ltda., S&#x000e3;o Jos&#x000e9; do Rio Preto,
SP, Brazil). In accordance with institutional CPB protocols, all patients received
1000 mg hydrocortisone after induction of anesthesia and again 4 hours after the
first dose. Antibiotic prophylaxis was administered to all patients as per
institutional infection control committee guidelines (1500 mg cefuroxime sodium,
after induction of anesthesia, and an additional 750 mg, 4 hours after the first
dose).</p><p>The roller-type circuit (adult full circuit for Console Ecobec<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>,
Braile Biom&#x000e9;dica Ltda., S&#x000e3;o Jos&#x000e9; do Rio Preto, SP, Brazil)
comprised a set of veno-arterial tubing, suction connectors, arterial filter,
polypropylene hollow-fiber membrane oxygenator, and a conventional hemoconcentrator.
Centrifugal-pump CPB used the same circuit described above, with the addition of a
vortexcone centrifugal blood pump (BPX-80 Bio Pump Plus
Centrifugal<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Medtronic) attached to the console (Console
Centr&#x000ed;fuga Bio-Medicus<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and Bio-Probe TX40 Flow
Transducer<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Medtronic). After assembly of the CPB apparatus,
pumps were calibrated for the CPB procedure. Upon being weaned off bypass, patients
were administered dobutamine IV 3-5 &#x000b5;g/kg/min and noradrenaline intravenous
as needed to keep mean arterial pressure (MAP) &#x0003e; 70 mmHg. After surgery, while
still under general anesthesia, patients were transferred to the intensive care unit
(ICU) for postoperative (PO) care, where they were progressively weaned off both
infusions as hemodynamic status improved.</p><p>Radial artery catheterization was performed by the cutdown technique for measurement
of MAP. From this catheter, blood samples were drawn after anesthetic induction but
before CPB (time point M1), at 30 minutes of CPB (time point M2), and 24h PO (time
point M3). Immediately after sampling, levels of two markers of hemolysis - serum
haptoglobin and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) - were measured. LDH measurement was
performed in an automated Fusion<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> analyzer, and haptoglobin
measurement, in a Biospectro SP-220<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> spectrophotometer. For
analysis of inflammation, levels of I)-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor
alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;) were measured at time points 1 and 2. For this purpose, samples
were centrifuged and the plasma drawn into Eppendorf microtubes and stored at
-20&#x000ba;C. All kits for IL analysis were processed simultaneously, thus
preventing any loss. Serum IL and TNF-&#x003b1; concentrations were measured by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using commercially available kits
(IL-1&#x003b2;/1F2 Quantikine High Sensitivity<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, TNF-&#x003b1;
Quantikine High Sensitivity<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, and IL-6 Duo Set<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>,
R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). All kits were processed in accordance with
manufacturer instructions. CRP levels were measured in an automated
Vitrus<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 5.1 analyzer in samples drawn at M1, M2, and M3.</p><p>For statistical analysis, the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test was used for the
variable age, and Student's t-test for body weight and all CPB variables. Goodman's
test<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> for
contrasts within and among multinomial populations was used for the variables
comorbidity and number of deaths. The EuroSCORE II stratification system was applied
in all patients, with subsequent analysis of mean scores for each group.
Nonparametric repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) for independent samples
with Dunn's multiple comparisons was used for analysis of haptoglobin and CRP.
Nonparametric repeated-measures ANOVA for independent samples with Bonferroni
multiple comparisons<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> was used for analysis of LDH and IL levels. Spearman
linear correlation coefficients were calculated to test for correlation between each
of the studied markers and duration of CPB, as well as for correlations among
markers of hemolysis and markers of inflammation. Using the study of
P&#x000ea;go-Fernandes et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> as a basis, the sample size was calculated as 30
patients per group for a statistical power of 80% and a significance level of
5%.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The demographic characteristics of participants were similar in the two groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Mean patient age was 66 years in G1

second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, provides a means of temporarily
replacing the pumping action of the heart and the ventilatory action of the lungs.
It also allows recovery of blood from the operative field by suction pumps after
systemic anticoagulation (intraoperative blood salvage), thus keeping the heart
well-nourished while in absolute standstill induced by infusion of cardioplegic
solution. The pumping action of the heart is taken over by an arterial pump (roller
or centrifugal), while the ventilatory function of the lungs is replaced by an
oxygenator. Biocompatible plastic tubing connects the patient, oxygenator, and
arterial pump, thus allowing extracorporeal blood circulation. While some patients
are fit to undergo CABG without CPB (so-called "off-pump" surgery), others require
an onpump approach due to hemodynamic instability<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Despite its significant benefits, such as providing a bloodless surgical field, CPB
is associated with postperfusion syndrome, a condition whereby biochemical mediators
trigger coagulopathy (through activation of the complement system), left ventricular
dysfunction and myocardial ischemia (mediated by IL-6 and IL8), fibrinolysis (caused
by free radicals), vasoplegia (associated with kinins), and cell death (through
TNF-&#x003b1; action), as well as generation of reactive oxygen species as a result
of ischemia and reperfusion. This combination of factors may lead to increased
susceptibility to infection, potentially critical multiple-organ dysfunction, and
even death<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>CPB can also cause hemolysis, either because of poor calibration of the arterial pump
or occasionally because of the prolonged duration of the procedure. The most
specific acutephase marker of hemolysis is serum haptoglobin. Circulating plasma
haptoglobin is responsible for binding and transporting free hemoglobin from the
circulation to the liver, spleen, and bone marrow, where hemoglobin is reprocessed
after erythrocyte lysis. Erythrocytes also contain the enzyme LDH. LDH levels
increase at the onset of cell destruction, including erythrocyte lysis
(<italic>e.g</italic>., due to mechanical heart valve dysfunction, acute
myocardial infarction, chest trauma, or CPB)<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. Thus, LDH can be used as a marker of
hemolysis, although it is nonspecific for this purpose. After rupture of the
erythrocyte membrane, the erythrocyte stroma remains in the circulation, where it
acts as a proinflammatory agent; thus, hemolysis accentuates the inflammation that
occurs in CPB.</p><p>When hemolysis is particularly intense, haptoglobin levels decline markedly, and may
even become undetectable. This was observed in the present study: haptoglobin
concentrations declined after CPB, probably due to formation of
haptoglobinhemoglobin complexes, which prevent renal loss of
hemoglobin<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>. However, there was no significant betweengroup difference.
Recovery of haptoglobin levels was observed at the 24h PO time point. In a previous
comparison of roller <italic>vs.</italic> centrifugal pumps in a sample of 27
patients, P&#x000ea;go-Fernandes et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> failed to find any significant between-group
difference in haptoglobin levels when the duration of CPB was &#x0003c; 110 minutes. In
an <italic>in vitro</italic> experiment, Bennett et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> found that roller pumps
were associated with marked hemolysis as compared to centrifugal pumps. Upon
erythrocyte lysis, LDH is released into the circulation, and plasma LDH levels rise
substantially. In the present study, elevated LDH levels were found after CPB
(specifically, up to 24h postoperatively), but there was no significant
between-group difference. Patients with a longer duration of CPB exhibited higher
LDH levels when allocated to the centrifugal pump group, and patients in both groups
exhibited a positive association of LDH levels with inflammatory mediators at the
post-CPB and 24h PO time points. In a comparative study, Keyser et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>
found no difference between pump types, although levels of this marker were elevated
after CPB and remained elevated up to 12h PO. Yoshikai et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> also analyzed LDH in 29
patients in a comparative study of CPB pumps, but failed to find any significant
difference between pump types. In a meta-analysis, Saczkowski et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>
included randomized clinical trials comparing CPB pump types and found no
differences in the variables of interest. The authors expected to find evidence of
insults with all pump types; however, this was not the case. In the present study,
we found that hemolytic responses occurred with both types of CPB pump at the time
points of assessment, but with no significant between-group differences.</p><p>ILs mediate and regulate inflammatory and immune reactions. Although there are
several proinflammatory cytokines, the present study focused on IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6
and TNF-&#x003b1;. Even after brief periods of CPB, the inflammatory response to
extracorporeal circulation immediately triggers a variety of immune reactions. In
the present study, with a relatively short duration of CPB, inflammation occurred in
both groups at the time points of assessment, but there was no significant
between-group difference.</p><p>IL-1&#x003b2; levels usually rise after CPB. However, they are often undetectable due
to hemodilution<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>.
In the present study, there was no significant difference in levels of this IL
across time points or groups. IL-6 levels are known to rise 2 to 4 hours after
surgical incision. In patients who have undergone CPB, levels of this marker are
elevated even after hemodilution<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>. In the present study, this phenomenon was observed
in both groups at the time points of assessment, but with no significant
between-group difference. Patients in G1 with a longer duration of CPB exhibited
higher IL-6 levels. In a study of 41 patients, Ashraf et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> found that centrifugal
pumps induced more severe inflammation than roller pumps, as demonstrated by
significantly higher IL-6 and C5b levels in the centrifugal group, demonstrating the
proinflammatory nature of CPB. TNF-&#x003b1; accounts for many of the systemic
complications and severe infections seen after this procedure. In the present study,
TNF-&#x003b1; levels were elevated at the post-CPB time point in G1, but there was no
significant difference between groups. Among patients with a longer duration of CPB,
levels of this cytokine were significantly higher in G1. Baufreton et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>, in
a study of 29 patients, also showed that centrifugal pumps induced worse
inflammation than roller pumps; however, IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; levels were similar
in both groups, with no significant difference. Mlejnsky et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> reported that the use of
centrifugal pumps during CPB with prolonged hypothermic arrest is associated with a
reduced inflammatory response as compared to roller-pump CPB.</p><p>It is important to note that constitutive production of cytokines occurs in the human
body, whereby specialized cells express a baseline level of these proteins under
normal circumstances (in the present study, the pre-CPB time point can be considered
as this baseline for the cytokines of interest). It is understood that any agent or
factor can trigger an inflammatory process, including cell necrosis. The liver
responds to the inflammatory process by synthesizing acute-phase protein, CRP, which
is a known marker of coronary heart disease risk in ill patients<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>. This protein is related
to infectious complications, as well as to the inflammatory response induced by CPB;
in this setting, its levels may increase up to 6 hours postoperatively, and
correlate with the severity of inflammation. In the present study, the increase in
CRP at the 24h postoperative time point suggested post-CPB inflammation, but without
a significant difference between groups. Cremer et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> report that increased IL-6
levels promote circulatory and metabolic instability, which leads to CRP release,
stimulating further tissue inflammation.</p><p>In the present study, we also sought to address whether correlations exist between
markers of hemolysis and inflammatory mediators at the post-CPB and 24h PO time
points. The immune system responds to trauma with varying degrees of severity by
releasing molecular compounds, including those of the complement system, which
stimulate release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6 and
TNF-&#x003b1;. Hemolysis may occur through three distinct mechanisms: natural
selection in the spleen; physical or chemical imbalances (generally pathological);
or exposure of cells to mechanical trauma<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>. According
to Kameneva et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>, the intensity of hemolysis depends on the flow rate of
suction, on the degree of blood viscosity, on the duration of extracorporeal
perfusion, and on the storage time of the packed red blood cells used in perfusate
or otherwise during the CPB procedure. The mechanical hemolysis associated with CPB
pumps is of the intravascular type, which causes cell lysis (particularly of
erythrocytes) with subsequent release of hemoglobin into the blood plasma. With
roller pumps, cell trauma may occur when the rollers are poorly calibrated or set.
In centrifugal pumps, hemolysis may occur when there is excessive negative pressure
driving blood flow<sup>[<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>. Pohlmann et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> reported that suction during CPB is a
major factor in CPBassociated hemolysis, and that the negative pressure exerted by
the pump and exposure of blood to air combine to make this hemolysis more
severe.</p><p>As erythrocytes rupture, their contents and remnants (the erythrocyte stroma) remain
in the bloodstream, inducing an acute inflammatory response with activation of
inflammatory mediators such as the complement system, which, in turn, stimulates
IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; secretion. In our sample, we observed a positive
association between haptoglobin and LDH with IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, and TNF-&#x003b1; at
the post-CPB and 24h PO time points, denoting induction of inflammation in both
groups. The frequency of this association was higher in the G1 group, both at
post-CPB and at 24h PO. The roller-type pump used in this study contained four main
rollers (one arterial and three for suction); compounded by variations in the blood
volume present in the venous reservoir, this may account for the greater frequency
of the aforementioned correlations in G1<sup>[<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup>. As the
centrifugal CPB pump has no arterial roller and contains only three rollers (all for
suction) and blood is impelled by centrifugal force, maintaining a stable blood
volume in the venous reservoir, the frequency of these correlations was lower in G2.
Cell trauma was observed with both CPB pumps, but more severely with the roller pump
(G1), as demonstrated by the frequency of associations.</p><p>According to Mota et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>, the onset of hemolysis and inflammation also depends on
the duration of CPB, the conduction of CPB and the material used in the process.
According to Dienstmann and Caregnato<sup>[<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup>, stress that conducting perfusion with good cardiac
output, brief duration of CPB whenever possible, strict control of initial venous
drainage and hemodilution, and proper oxygenation and acid-base balance could
minimize hemolysis and inflammation. These authors also noted the relevant
correlation between inflammatory response and hemolysis in the postoperative period
of patients who undergo on-pump cardiovascular surgery, as the possibility of
multisystem complications could have repercussions for duration of mechanical
ventilation and length of ICU stay. In the present study, the release of
inflammatory mediators during CPB was clearly unrelated to age, sex, preoperative
cardiac function, or even type of cardiovascular surgery. Both groups were
homogeneous in terms of demographic characteristics, operative technique and
perfusion technique, thus enabling comparison of the outcomes of interest. All
patients underwent morbidity and mortality risk stratification via the EuroSCORE II
system, which showed that patients in both groups were at low risk of adverse
outcomes (scores in the range of 0-2). Both pump types tested proved efficient and
safe during CPB, as demonstrated by the analyzed parameters.</p><p>In this study, as in most cardiovascular surgery procedures, hydrocortisone was
administered in an attempt to minimize the inflammatory effects of CPB. Although
patients received this corticosteroid both before CPB (M1) and during CPB (M2),
levels of inflammatory markers were elevated in both study groups.</p><p>In a meta-analysis, Ali-Hassan-Sayegh et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> showed that prophylactic corticosteroids
could reduce the complication rate significantly and improve clinical outcomes in
patients undergoing CABG, and could be considered both safe and effective. Zakkar et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup>
states that hemolysis, ischemiareperfusion injury, and neutrophil activation during
CPB play critical roles in oxidative stress and proinflammatory activation, which,
in turn, may lead to multiple-organ dysfunction. These investigators believe the
administration of antioxidant agents during surgery could mitigate the negative
effects of CPB.</p><p>Although we deemed our sample size according to P&#x000ea;go-Fernandes et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>, we
believe it was still small enough to constitute a limitation, and that further
research with larger samples is warranted. Due to the small sample size per group
and the relatively short, similar duration of CPB in both groups, the study may have
been underpowered to detect differences between pump types. Although the routine
administration of vasopressors follows standardized protocols at our facility, the
lack of data on vasopressor dosages used in each group constitutes a limitation of
the present study. Future studies by our group in this line of research will include
analysis of vasopressor dosage and larger sample sizes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, both CPB pump types tested in this study induced hemolysis and
inflammation concurrently. However, there were no significant differences in markers
of hemolysis or in inflammatory mediators between the centrifugal pump and roller
pump groups. Positive associations were found between LDH and duration of CPB at 24h
postoperatively in G2 (centrifugal pump) and between IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; and
duration of CPB immediately after CPB in G1 (roller pump). Positive associations
were also found among markers of hemolysis and markers of inflammation in G1 and G2,
both post-CPB and at 24h postoperatively; however, the frequency of such
associations was higher in G1.</p><table-wrap id="t7" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="5%" span="1"/><col width="95%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ACP</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Conception and design; analysis and

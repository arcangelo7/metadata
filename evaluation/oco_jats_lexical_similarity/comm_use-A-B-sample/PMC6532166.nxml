Chronic hypoxia and the resulting oxidative stress have been shown to be involved in the development and progression of cardiovascular disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Our previous study confirmed hypoxia plays an important role in the development of myocardial damage at the early stage of burn injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, knowledge of the specific mechanism by which hypoxia affects cardiomyocytes is still unclear. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the biological processes leading to myocardial damage, especially hypoxia, is required. Mitochondria are known as energy factories in cells and participate in regulating endogenous apoptosis. The integrity of the structure and function of mitochondria is a key point in maintaining the physiological function of cells. Myocardial mitochondria are subjected to various stimuli, such as hypoxia. It has been shown that destroyed mitochondria, characterized by swollen mitochondrial matrix, decreased membrane potential, or ruptured outer membrane, were always noted in damaged cardiomyocytes, leading to the open of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), cytochrome c (Cyt c)&#x000a0;releasing from mitochondria into the cytosol, and caspase kinase activation, followed by apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, the precise mechanism of hypoxia-induced mitochondrial destruction and apoptosis is still unclear.</p><p id="Par10">Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1) was identified as an interacting protein for the cytoplasmic domain of tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) at first [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The distribution of TRAP1 was in the inner mitochondrial membrane and intermembrane space. TRAP1, which was a molecular chaperone, played an essential role in the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis and the function of the protein transport system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It was confirmed that TRAP1 overexpression inhibited hypoxia-induced decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, decline in cell viability, and increase in cell death; conversely, the knockdown of TRAP1 aggravated the hypoxia-induced cell damage. Furthermore, we found that blocking the mPTP opening prevented the injury caused by TRAP1 knockdown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, the specific mechanism has not been well clarified.</p><p id="Par11">As mentioned before, TRAP1 shows a major effect on the protection of cardiomyocytes towards hypoxia; however, whether and how TRAP1 regulates energy metabolism in hypoxic cardiomyocytes remains elusive. Our previous study further revealed that cytochrome c oxidase (COX) subunit II (COXII), a component of COX, is one of the downstream effectors that mediate the TRAP1-regulated energy generation program. Previous studies on COXII have mainly focused on electron transfer and energy generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The results from our previously published study demonstrated that the COXII-COX pathway is involved in the myocardial energy productive process regulated by TRAP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, the effect and mechanism of COXII on the apoptosis of hypoxic cardiomyocytes are not clear. Jancura et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] reported that COXII affected the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), an apoptosis inducer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Recently, in a model of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, it was found that the disease increased the expression of COXII and the proportion of apoptosis significantly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Additionally, it was reported that high COXII expression reduced ROS production in a feedback manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. These results indicate that the changes in COXII are related to apoptosis process; at least, the mechanism is not achieved by reducing the production of ATP.</p><p id="Par12">The aim of the present study was to explore whether TRAP1 could protect against apoptosis in hypoxic cardiomyocytes. We revealed the antiapoptotic function of TRAP1 in cardiomyocytes under hypoxic conditions and showed that COXII was one of the downstream effectors by which TRAP1 mediates its antiapoptotic effects through a mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway. Our findings enriched the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis adjustment in cardiomyocytes under hypoxic conditions, offering novel insight into the prevention and treatment of hypoxia-induced myocardial damage.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Generation of viral constructs</title><p id="Par13">The recombinant viral vectors in the present study were constructed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression vectors encoding TRAP1 (Ad_TRAP1) and COXII (Ad_COXII) were produced. Adenoviral vectors expressing shRNA specifically targeting TRAP1 (TRAP1_shRNA) and COXII (COXII_shRNA), respectively, were also generated. Moreover, vectors encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP) sequence and vectors containing nonspecific shRNA were constructed in the same way and served as negative controls correspondingly.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Cardiomyocyte culture and the generation of a hypoxic model</title><p id="Par14">Animals that were used in the present study were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Third Military Medical University&#x000a0;(Army Medical University). The isolation and cultivation of ventricular cardiomyocytes derived from neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats (days 1&#x02013;3), as well as the generation of hypoxic cardiomyocytes, were achieved by previous methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In brief, isolated cardiomyocytes were plated on collagen-coated plates and cultured in DMEM/F12 medium (HyClone, USA) with 10% FBS (HyClone, USA), 0.1&#x02009;mM bromodeoxyuridine (Sigma, USA), 100&#x02009;U/ml penicillin, and 100&#x02009;U/ml streptomycin (Sigma, USA) in an incubator of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. Hypoxic medium was produced by placing serum-free medium into a vacuum glove box filled with a mixed gas containing 94% nitrogen, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, and 1% O<sub>2</sub> overnight.

Adenoviral vectors that encoded GFP as a control (Ad_GFP) or TRAP1 (Ad_TRAP1) were generated at first. The western blotting results revealed that TRAP1 expression increased significantly in the Ad_TRAP1 group than those in the Ad_GFP group and in the control group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Then, we also generated adenoviral-mediated expression of scrambled shRNA (Cont_shRNA) or shRNA specifically targeting TRAP1 (TRAP1_shRNA), and both had a GFP tag. Western blotting was also used to confirm the effective silencing of endogenousTRAP1 by TRAP1_siRNA adenovirus infection (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Then, a TUNEL assay was performed to observe the morphological characteristics of apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. Six treatment groups were divided randomly: normoxia, hypoxia, hypoxia+Ad_GFP, hypoxia+Ad_TRAP1, hypoxia+Cont_shRNA, and hypoxia+TRAP1_shRNA. Besides the normoxia group, cardiomyocytes in the other groups were cultured under hypoxic conditions for 6&#x02009;h. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c, hypoxia induced obvious morphological characteristics of cardiomyocyte apoptosis. The overexpression of TRAP1 significantly reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, while TRAP1 silencing showed the opposite effect (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c, d) in response to hypoxia. However, since pyroptosis can also induce a TUNEL-positive assay, we further determined whether TRAP1 have a role on pyroptosis. As caspase-1 is a key mediator in pyroptosis process, the effect of TRAP1 on caspase-1 activity was tested both in normoxic and hypoxic cardiomyocytes. The results showed TRAP1 had no effect on caspase-1 activity both in normoxic and hypoxic cardiomyocytes, and caspase-1 activities between hypoxia group and normoxia group had no significant differences (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). As a result, the data indicated that TRAP1 plays an antiapoptotic role in hypoxic cardiomyocytes.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1) regulates apoptosis in hypoxic cardiomyocytes. <bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold> Confirmation of viral-mediated overexpression or knockdown of TRAP1 in cardiomyocytes. <bold>a</bold> Western blotting demonstrated TRAP1 overexpression mediated by adenovirus (Ad_TRAP1).

The grouping and cultivation of cardiomyocytes were performed as mentioned above. The expression level of Cyt c in the cytosol in the hypoxia group was significantly increased than that in the normoxia group, and overexpression of TRAP1 (Ad_TRAP1) remarkably inhibited the hypoxia-induced increase in Cyt c detected in the cytosol (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, b). Meanwhile, the Cyt c expression level in the hypoxia+Ad_TRAP1 group was notably increased compared to that in the hypoxia group in the mitochondria (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c, d). Moreover, we further investigated the effect of TRAP1 (TRAP1_shRNA) knockdown on Cyt c in the cytosol and in the mitochondria. The results showed the Cyt c level in the hypoxia+TRAP1_shRNA group was significantly increased in the cytosolic fraction (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e, f) and decreased in the mitochondrial fraction than that in the hypoxia group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>g, h), indicating TRAP1 expression protected cardiomyocytes against apoptosis induced by hypoxia. Furthermore, caspase-3 activity was detected and the activity in the hypoxia group was robustly increased compared to that in the normoxia group, whereas little difference was noted between the hypoxia group and the hypoxia+Ad_GFP group. However, TRAP1 overexpression dramatically suppressed the elevated caspase-3 activity in cardiomyocytes under hypoxic conditions. Conversely, the knockdown of TRAP1 (TRAP_shRNA) significantly raised the caspase-3 activity when compared with the hypoxia group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>i).

Correspondingly, the oxidative stress that occurs during intermittent or continuous cellular hypoxia is involved in all these diseases to different extents. Neurocytes in oxygen-poor conditions lead to fatal consequences. In addition, myocardial damage caused by oxygen deficits should not be underestimated because hypoxia can directly lead to myocardial injuries, resulting in myocardial dysfunction and hemodynamic disorders. Therefore, it is critical to protect cardiomyocytes against hypoxia-induced damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of hypoxia-triggered myocardial damage not only contributes to the exploration of new therapeutic targets but also helps to develop novel methods for treatment. To date, more and more studies have been performed, and the mechanism of damage in hypoxic cardiomyocytes has been analyzed, but the results are not systematic and all-sided [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Hypoxia is a major risk factor for apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Maintaining the production of ATP and modulating apoptosis are two major functions of mitochondria. As a consequence, mitochondria play a key role in the response to hypoxia.</p><p id="Par28">Previous studies regarding TRAP1 were mainly focused on tumor cells, showing that TRAP1 stays at the crossroad of multiple crucial processes in the initiation of neoplastic transformation and oncogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. On the one hand, using an apoptotic inducer significantly inhibits the expression of TRAP1. On the other hand, TRAP1 knockdown in tumor cells induces Cyt c releasing from mitochondria into the cytosol and promotes apoptosis, whereas TRAP1 overexpression markedly attenuates the damage induced by oxidative stress and preserves the function of tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Although the differential expression of TRAP1 in cancer tissues plays an inhibitory role in mitochondrial apoptosis, knowledge of TRAP1 in normal tissues has not been well investigated. The results from our previous study demonstrated that TRAP1 improves the hypoxia-impaired energy production in cardiomyocytes. Hence, TRAP1 could regulate the death of normal cells in addition to tumor cells. To reveal the effect of TRAP1 on apoptosis in hypoxic cardiomyocytes, three different assays were performed to detect the percentage of apoptosis, the Cyt c levels and the caspase-3 activity. Moreover, the effect of TRAP1 on pyroptosis was also determined and the results showed pyroptosis did not activated and might not influence the downstream apoptosis factor in the present study. As reported before, mitochondrial Cyt c is an important apoptosis-inducing molecule in cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Caspase-3 presents as one of the essential executive molecules of the apoptotic process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Activation of the two abovementioned molecules represents the mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway was activated. Mechanistically, following the activation of the apoptotic pathway, a cascade reaction was subsequently stimulated, including BCL-2 inhibition, BAX and BAK oligomerization, mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, and the release of second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (SMAC) and Cyt c. Cyt c forms a complex with apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (APAF-1) and procaspase-9 to promote the conversion of procaspase-9 to active caspase-9; activated caspase-9 then cascades down to the executioner caspase (caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-7), finally leading to apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In this study, the overexpression of TRAP1 was found to play an inhibitory role in the apoptotic rate, mitochondrial Cyt c leakage, and caspase-3 activity in hypoxic cardiomyocytes, whereas the results in TRAP1 knockdown treatment were counterproductive, indicating that TRAP1 participates in the regulation of apoptosis in hypoxic cardiomyocytes in addition to its effect on energy production and that the effect of TRAP1 on apoptosis is achieved through a mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway. Previous study has showed TRAP1 can regulate COXII expression in cardiomyocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Further studies revealed that the overexpression of COXII weakened the proapoptotic effect of TRAP1_shRNA; in contrast, interfering COXII expression weakened the antiapoptotic effect of Ad_TRAP1 on cardiomyocytes in response to hypoxia, indicating that COXII was involved in the TRAP1-regulated apoptotic process, that is, TRAP1 regulates the apoptosis of hypoxic cardiomyocytes via the mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis pathway mediated by COXII.</p><p id="Par29">Mitochondria are the most important organelles in cardiomyocytes and are essential sites of ROS production. ROS are important apoptosis-inducing molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. A large amount of ROS will be produced in myocardial mitochondria along with the oxidative stress disequilibrium caused by hypoxia, leading to the lipid peroxidation of mitochondrial and cellular membranes, mitochondrial DNA damage, and the induction of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In the present study, the correlation between ROS and TRAP1 as well as COXII was first uncovered in cardiomyocytes exposed to hypoxia. The findings showed that TRAP1 overexpression markedly decreased ROS levels in hypoxic cardiomyocytes, whereas this inhibitory effect was substantially prevented by COXII knockdown. In contrast, TRAP1 knockdown markedly increased the release of ROS in hypoxic cardiomyocytes, but this enhancement effect was attenuated by COXII overexpression. We further observed that the tendency of ROS release was consistent with the change in Cyt c release and caspase-3 activity. These findings revealed that the release of ROS directly reflected the regulatory effect of TRAP1 on apoptosis in hypoxic cardiomyocytes through the mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway mediated by COXII, indicating that ROS are important molecules that contribute to the modulation of TRAP1 on apoptosis through the mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway mediated by COXII.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par30">The present study demonstrates that TRAP1 regulates hypoxia-induced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes via the mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway mediated by COXII, in which ROS are important components.

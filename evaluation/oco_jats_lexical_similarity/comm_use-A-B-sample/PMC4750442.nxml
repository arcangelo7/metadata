</p></sec><sec><title>More health workers needed </title><p>Some countries in the WHO European Region may not have enough health workers to respond to the growing health needs of their ageing populations in coming years, according to a WHO report. </p><p>The report, entitled <italic>Core health indicators in the WHO European Region 2015,</italic> with a special focus on human resources<italic>,</italic> shows that health workforce shortages and imbalances constitute a major public health concern for the region that requires prompt action. </p><p>Although the number of health-care workers has increased overall in the region by nearly 10% over the last decade, this growth was uneven between countries and not necessarily in the countries where health professionals are most needed, the report said. </p><p>One in three physicians is more than 55&#x000a0;years old, an increase of 6&#x000a0;percentage points over the past 7&#x000a0;years. </p><p>The report found that there were five times more physicians in some countries than in others, and that some countries had nine times fewer nurses than others calculated per head of population. Greece registered 619 physicians per 100&#x000a0;000 population in 2013, for example, while Albania had 128. </p><p>The number of medical graduates must increase to replace them, for example, in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kyrgyzstan and Turkey, where the number of physicians per 100&#x000a0;000 habitants is below 200. In Albania, only 261 physicians graduated in 2013. </p><p>The report is an annual publication providing an overview of the European health situation. The most recent edition provides key statistics on health workforce employment and education. </p><p>The report also includes other key health statistics, such as mortality and morbidity data, demographic and socioeconomic indicators, health services utilization and health expenditure.</p><p>&#x0201c;Human resources are the cornerstone of the health system in any country, and the planning, regulation and management of the health workforce requires extensive intersectoral collaboration &#x02013; both topics are at the heart of the Health 2020 policy,&#x0201d; says Dr&#x000a0;Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO Regional Director for Europe, referring to its core strategy. </p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.euro.who.int/en/data-and-evidence/core-health-indicators-in-the-who-european-region/core-health-indicators-in-the-who-european-region-2015.-special-focus-human-resources-for-health">http://www.euro.who.int/en/data-and-evidence/core-health-indicators-in-the-who-european-region/core-health-indicators-in-the-who-european-region-2015.-special-focus-human-resources-for-health</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>Medicines for Yemen </title><p>WHO delivered more than 100&#x000a0;000 kilos of medical supplies and medicines to Taiz governorate in Yemen, but was unable to distribute them all because of continued fighting in spite of the 15&#x000a0;to 21&#x000a0;December ceasefire agreement. </p><p>The supplies were destined for some 3&#x000a0;million people in need of humanitarian assistance in eight districts, including 392&#x000a0;000 internally displaced persons.</p><p>As of early January, drugs and medical supplies had been distributed to 13&#x000a0;hospitals and health centres and had helped to refill the contingency stock in Taiz. </p><p>These provisions included oxygen cylinders, surgical devices and trauma management equipment. </p><p>But WHO was unable to distribute 22&#x000a0;000 kilos of medical aid to health facilities in three districts of Taiz City, where 400&#x000a0;000 people were in desperate need of items such as oxygen cylinders, fluids and consumables for kidney dialysis. </p><p>&#x0201c;WHO is deeply concerned about the continuous lack of humanitarian access to Taiz City, depriving people of basic health care and violating their essential human rights,&#x0201d; said Dr&#x000a0;Ahmed Shadoul, WHO Representative in Yemen. </p><p>&#x0201c;WHO re-emphasizes the crucial need for uninterrupted delivery of health services and calls upon all concerned parties to respect the basic rights of all Yemenis to access health-care services,&#x0201d; Shadoul said. </p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.emro.who.int/media/news/who-calls-for-immediate-access-to-taiz-city-for-delivery-of-life-saving-health-supplies.html">http://www.emro.who.int/media/news/who-calls-for-immediate-access-to-taiz-city-for-delivery-of-life-saving-health-supplies.html</ext-link></p><boxed-text id="Bb" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Cover photo</title></caption><p>Somali refugees leaving Shimbiro Beach to board smugglers&#x02019; boats to Yemen.

Doing so would raise the risk of incorrectly portraying low levels of impact and, thus, of jeopardizing political support of the policy,&#x0201d; the policy brief says, adding that only countries that had implemented smoke-free laws for at least 2&#x000a0;years were evaluated.</p><p>There is no safe level of exposure to second-hand smoke, the policy brief notes, adding that comprehensive smoke-free laws are the only effective means of eliminating the risks associated with passive smoking. </p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/276557/How-can-we-best-protect-non-smokers,-Evidence-Brief-Eng.pdf?ua=1">http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/276557/How-can-we-best-protect-non-smokers,-Evidence-Brief-Eng.pdf?ua=1</ext-link>

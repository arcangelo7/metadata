is increasingly associated with serious nosocomial infections, especially in
immunocompromised patients; however, the occurrence of endocarditis due to this
organism is rare<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. Reports of
SM-caused endocarditis usually are related to either aortic valve
prosthesis<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> or mitral
valve prosthesis<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>, or to patients
who have a history of invasive procedures, such as pacemaker
implantations<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>, or a
history of accompanying immunosuppressive disease<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. However, SM reporting as cause of endocarditis in
the native mitral valve is extremely rare. Furthermore, in cases where SM
endocarditis was reported in the native mitral valve, only medical treatment with
antibiotics has been mentioned<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.
To the best of our knowledge, there is no other report in the literature in which it
was required valve replacement surgery because of SM endocarditis in the patient&#x02019;s
native mitral valve although there was no immunosuppressive disease. It's herein
presented a patient who underwent valve replacement and simultaneous femoral
embolectomy operation due to SM endocarditis in her native mitral valve.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>CASE REPORT</title><p>An ethical approval was obtained from the institutional board and authorities. A
59-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with fever and blurred consciousness.
The patient, with hemodialysis-dependent chronic renal failure for seven years, had
been catheterized with a permanent hemodialysis catheter from the right internal
jugular vein in an external center 10 days before. She was severely dyspneic and
orthopneic. According to her relatives, she had fluctuations in her consciousness.
She was sometimes able to recognize her relatives, and sometimes she could not do
that. Additionally, her right lower extremity had been cold and cyanotic for three
days. She had a loss of motion in her right lower extremity. Echocardiographic
evaluation revealed mobile vegetation with an extremely fragile appearance on the
posterior leaflet of mitral valve. The mitral valve opening was highly restricted
due to vegetation on the leaflet. Her ejection fraction was 60% and pulmonary artery
pressure was 50 mmHg. There was left atrial dilatation and a minimal tricuspid
regurgitation. Despite of her dyspnea, her hemodynamic parameters allowed us to
perform coronary angiography. There was no coronary lesion requiring surgery. The
patient was operated as an emergency and right femoral embolectomy was performed
simultaneously with mitral valve replacement. In regard to its macroscopic
appearance, a similar material, like the one on the mitral valve, was taken out from
the femoral artery. After the procedure, the blood flow in her lower extremity was
normal. During the exploration, it was observed that the right atrial structures
were clean and there was no vegetation on the tricuspid valve. Since everything had
started with the last catheterization, we wanted to ensure all the right heart
structures. Each fold, each structure, and all blind points at the first sight in
the right heart (in both atrium and ventricle) were examined carefully.
Interestingly, nothing wrong was observed. Similar examinations were carried out for
the left heart. This was important because, she had a femoral embolus and possibly
cerebrovascular events due to this mobile vegetation. So, through the incisions and
resected mitral valve area, the structures of the whole left heart were examined
carefully. The difference of this operation from a classical endocarditis surgery
was that the patient had a history of embolism in two separate systems (leg and
brain). This forced the surgical team to make sure that all the chambers/folds in
the heart were clean. Cross-clamp and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) times were 160
mins and 182 mins, respectively. She did not need any kind of circulatory assistance
equipment during or after the surgery. However, the patient was under inotropic
drugs support during the surgery after CPB and in her postoperative period. As it
can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>, when mitral valve was
explored through superior septal approach, fragile vegetation was observed on
posterior mitral leaflet. After resection of the native valve, mechanical mitral
valve replacement was performed with a #27 Sorin-Carbomedics mitral valve. Both the
vegetation materials on leaflet and the femoral embolectomy materials were sent for
microbiological examination. The patient was taken to the intensive care unit after
the operation and hemodialysis was performed. Since the preoperative period, an
empirical antibiotic treatment was started by infectious diseases specialists. The
patient consciously awakened in the intensive care unit. As a result of
microbiological studies, which were performed on hemoculture samples obtained during
her admittance in the infectious disease clinic three days before, SM was isolated
and it was resistant to all antibiotics, except for trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole
(TMP-SMX). The antibiotic regimen was converted to TMP-SMX, but due to septic shock
complications, like severe hypotension unresponsive to continuous positive inotropic
and vasoconstrictor intravenous drug therapy, she passed away on the postoperative
first day.</p><p>

</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>SM is a commensal and an emerging pathogen earlier noted in broad-spectrum
life-threatening infections among vulnerable people, but more recently as a pathogen
in immunocompetent individuals. According to previous reports, SM can lead to
necrotizing otitis, cutaneous infections, endocarditis, meningitis, acute
respiratory tract infections, bacteremia, tropical pyomyositis, cystic fibrosis, and
septic arthritis<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>. However, when
the literature is examined carefully, it is observed that endocarditis caused by
this bacterium is extremely rare<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>
and especially includes a certain group of patients. This particular group of
patients includes those with aortic or mitral prosthetic valve replacement and those
with immune deficiency for any reason<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. SM-caused endocarditis of native mitral valve is
quite rare in the literature. Moreover, when the reports of these cases are
examined, it is seen that they were subjected to a previous treatment, such as
balloon mitral valvuloplasty, even if there is a native mitral valve<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. If we specify precisely, to the
best of our knowledge, the patient in this article is the first report in the
literature regarding to three different aspects:</p><p>
<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>1 - This is the first patient in the literature who underwent mitral
valve replacement surgery due to SM endocarditis although he/she had
previously untouched native mitral valve.</p></list-item><list-item><p>2 - This is the first patient in the literature who underwent femoral
embolectomy operation due to septic embolism caused by SM. Additionally,
fluctuations of her consciousness could be a result of septic
cerebrovascular embolism.</p></list-item><list-item><p>3 - <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref> is the first
intraoperative photograph in the literature exhibiting the vegetation
caused by SM.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Due to these three features mentioned above, this case is believed to have an
important place in the literature.</p><p>As mentioned in the previous literature<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>, SM is truly a life-threatening microorganism. Unfortunately,
using even today's state-of-the-art technologies, like open-heart surgeries, to
treat SM-induced endocarditis is not enough to be successful. There are two main
reasons for this failure:</p><p>
<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>&#x003b1; - As seen in most of the previous reports in the literature, SM
is often and only sensitive to TMP-SMX. According to Shah et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>,
minocycline can be an alternative choice for the treatment of SM
endocarditis. However, TMP-SMX was the only effective antibiotic in our
culture antibiogram. There was no minocycline among the 19 antibiotics
in our culture antibiogram. As a result, SM is resistant to a large
number of other antibiotics present in a conventional antibiogram
report. However, TMP-SMX is not the first choice of conventional
empirical treatment of endocarditis. And the rarity of the incidence
does not justify the idea that TMP-SMX should be an additional agent in
each case of endocarditis. Facing a case of endocarditis, a physician
prefers to proceed with antibiotics that are believed to be much
stronger. This contradiction makes the body vulnerable to SM and the
microorganism finds easier to operate.</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x003b2; - A further disadvantage is that the time taken for the culture
and culture antibiogram is long enough to facilitate the ability of SM
to form the septic events. However, for the time being, it does not look
like it is possible to avoid. With the studies to be carried out in this
regard, early detection may be possible in the future with the
development of tests that perform several antigen measurements that may
be specific for SM. In this way, waiting for hours instead of days for
the result can really be lifesaving.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>SM endocarditis is a serious condition that is progressively rapid and fatal despite
the surgical treatment choices, like open-heart surgeries. The only satisfactory
thing about endocarditis caused by this microorganism is that it is rarely seen. It
is important to work on rapid diagnostic methods that will be developed specifically
for this microorganism. It's believed that this article will encourage researchers
in this direction.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="10%" span="1"/><col width="90%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">IA</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Substantial contributions to the

Despite significant effort, there is no animal model capable of recapitulating the complexity of PCa bone metastasis. The humanized mouse model for PCa bone metastasis used in this study aims to provide a platform for the assessment of new drugs by recapitulating the human&#x02013;human cell interactions relevant for disease development and progression. The humanized tissue-engineered bone construct (hTEBC) was created within NOD-scid IL2rg<sup>null</sup> (NSG) mice and was used for the study of experimental PC3-Luc bone metastases. It was confirmed that PC3-Luc cells preferentially grew in the hTEBC compared with murine bone. The translational potential of the humanized mouse model for PCa bone metastasis was evaluated with two clinically approved osteoprotective therapies, the non-species-specific bisphosphonate zoledronic acid (ZA) or the human-specific antibody Denosumab, both targeting Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor Kappa-&#x00392; Ligand. ZA, but not Denosumab, significantly decreased metastases in hTEBCs, but not murine femora. These results highlight the importance of humanized models for the preclinical research on PCa bone metastasis and indicate the potential of the bioengineered mouse model to closely mimic the metastatic cascade of PCa cells to human bone. Eventually, it will enable the development of new effective antimetastatic treatments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Bone cancer</kwd><kwd>Bone</kwd><kwd>Bone cancer</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9;

HuRANKL mice were up to 20% smaller than wild-type mice at 4 months of age, had significantly lower Tartrate-Resistant Acid Phosphatase 5b (TRACP-5b) serum levels and an altered bone phenotype with reduced osteoclast and osteoblast surfaces.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> These limitations of the model influence the general comparability of the results with other mouse models as well as the clinical translatability.

Together with fibrin glue and recombinant human bone morphogenic protein 2 (rhBMP-2), the hOB scaffold and the GelMA core formed the hTEBC, which was subcutaneously implanted into male NOD-scid IL2rg<sup>null</sup> (NSG) mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Ultrasound-assisted intra-cardiac injection of PC3-Luc cells into the left ventricle was performed after 12 weeks of in vivo bone formation and led to the development of experimental PCa metastases. The PCa metastases were subsequently treated twice per week with ZA or Denosumab for six consecutive weeks. Throughout the study bone formation was monitored by x-ray (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>) and in vivo computed tomography (CT) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>) and showed an increase of mineralized tissue at the hTEBC implantation site. Distribution and outgrowth of human PC3-Luc metastases were studied using in vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI). Fold changes of the average total flux over time revealed a significant therapeutic effect of ZA in week 13 and 14 by reducing the initial tumor burden to 0.78-fold (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.015) and 0.87-fold (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.034), respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). Denosumab appeared to decrease the tumor burden in week 13 to 0.95, but without a statistically significant difference when compared with PBS (1.19-fold). In week 15, ZA treatment led to a significantly lower metastatic burden (1.52-fold, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.016) compared with Denosumab (2.38-fold) and PBS (4.09-fold). This pattern was still apparent in week 16 where animals treated with ZA showed the least increase in total flux values (3.87-fold), followed by Denosumab (8.70-fold) and PBS (15.17-fold), although this was not statistically significant. At week 17 and 18, neither ZA (48.29- and 154.22-fold) nor Denosumab (57.04- and 271.57-fold) had an observable therapeutic effect when compared with PBS (78.78- and 182.11-fold). Representative BLI time courses of the study are shown next to the graph (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>).

Therefore, comparison of ex vivo BLI results with IHC staining for human-specific LaminAC, Ki67, and human-specific CD44 of mouse livers as independent organs of the research question on bone metastasis was conducted (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Ex vivo BLI analysis (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6 for Denosumab; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5 for ZA and PBS) did not show a significant difference in liver metastasis between the three groups (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>).

At higher magnification, it was apparent that the PC3-Luc cells were growing in a hematopoietic microenvironment comprised of bone marrow (black arrowheads) and mineralized tissue (asterisks) resembling a physiological bone niche within the hTEBC. IHC staining of the lesion with human-specific LaminAC (left panel) confirmed the human origin of the lesions and staining for CD44 (right panel) identified it as PCa metastasis derived from PC3-Luc cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>).

Human PCa bone metastasis to both hTEBCs and murine femora were confirmed with ex vivo BLI and IHC. However, for hTEBCs the results of the two methods are much more comparable. The distribution of the individual values, as well as the statistical significance of both data sets, was similar for hTEBCs, but not for murine femora. In contrast to the murine femur, the hTEBC is located directly underneath the skin. Therefore, the hTEBC is covered by less tissue layers, which evades some of the drawbacks associated with in vivo BLI imaging of mouse bones. Thus, IHC confirmed the ex vivo BLI data of metastases to the hTEBCs, but not to mouse femora. In addition, the hTEBC allows access to the bone microenvironment and investigation of cancer bone metastases in real time enabling serial sampling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup></p><p id="Par16">Both, ex vivo BLI and TRAP staining confirmed that ZA reduced the metastatic load significantly in hTEBCs, but not in mouse femora.

This group concluded that the effect of ZA on the reduction and inhibition of PCa metastasis depends on the biology of the respective cell line. Taking our results into account, the biology of the PCa cells and thus their behavior might rather depend on the microenvironment to which the primary tumor and/or distant bone metastases are exposed. This clearly highlights the importance of humanized models for preclinical research on PCa bone metastasis.</p><p id="Par17">The values for total flux ex vivo and TRAP-positive tissue area were consistently higher in hTEBCs than in mouse femora. This points toward a higher number of human PCa cells invading the humanized bone microenvironment compared with murine bone. Area analysis of IHC staining confirmed that the hTEBC is preferred as a bone niche for metastatic growth by human PC3-Luc cells over the murine femur. Metastatic lesions in the hTEBC were found to be larger compared with the mouse femur at the endpoint of the study. This indicates that the PCa cells either migrated to the humanized bone microenvironment at an earlier time point, allowing them to reach a bigger size, or that the metastatic growth of human PCa cells is generally favored in the humanized bone microenvironment. Various inherent tissue characteristics of the hTEBC and the murine femur could be the underlying reasons for this interesting observation. Stiffness, vascularization, and species-specific molecular clues of the tissue can influence the initial outgrowth as well as the proliferation of PCa cells as first postulated in the seed-and-soil hypothesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> It is well-known for breast cancer that the stiffness of the breast tissue is a crucial factor when it comes to therapy resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup> Furthermore, Horas et al. showed that the loss of the vitamin D receptor promotes the skeletal colonization behavior as well as the expression of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) cell markers of breast cancer cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> We hypothesize that the hTEBC is more attractive for PCa cells due to the humanized microenevironment provided.

Male NSG mice over 6 weeks of age were obtained from the internal breeding colony at TRI (led by A/Prof Pamela Pollock; TRI/376/12/WESLEY/CCQ/BREED). The animals were held under specific pathogen-free, temperature-controlled conditions and supplied with sterilized food and water at the Biological Resources facility at the Translational Research Institute (TRI; Brisbane, Australia). To subcutaneously (s.c.) implant the hTEBCs, two incisions were made longitudinally on the back of the animal and subcutaneous pockets in the required size were developed with blunt-ended scissors.

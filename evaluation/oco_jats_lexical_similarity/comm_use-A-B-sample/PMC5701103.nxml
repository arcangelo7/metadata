cardiac surgery children, chylothorax incidence is between 0.25% and 5.3%<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> and may occur through direct injury, mainly in the correction
of the ductus arteriosus and coarctation of the aorta, due to the anatomical
proximity to the thoracic duct originating from the chyle cistern, between L3 and
T10, ascends to the thoracic region at the time of aortic hiatus between T10 and
T12, and ends its course in an anastomosis at the junction of the subclavian vein
and left internal jugular vein<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.
It is also frequently related to surgeries for correction of right ventricular
outflow obstruction: tetralogy of Fallot and atresia of the pulmonary artery with or
without ventricular septal defect.</p><p>Chylothorax can also occur due to an increase venous pressure in the superior vena
cava, the site of the thoracic duct opening, mainly related to Glenn's operation and
total cavopulmonary derivation<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>.
Recently, with the evolution of pediatric cardiac surgery and concomitant increase
in complexity, an increase in the incidence of chylothorax as a postoperative
complication of these procedures could be noted, and pediatric cardiac surgery is
now the main cause of chylothorax in terciary hospitals<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Other possible causes of chylothorax are traumatic ones, such as neoplasms and
infections of the lymphatic system; and traumatic, such as open traumas<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The persistence of chylothorax with continuous lymph extravasation may lead to the
depletion of lymphocyte mass, nutrients, proteins, immunoglobulins, coagulation
factors, vitamins<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>, increasing postoperative morbidity and mortality
due to infectious, nutritional complications and longer hospital stay.</p><p>Regarding the existing treatments for chylothorax, some conservative proposals aim to
decrease the production of the pound and its secretion in the pleural cavity. After
pleural drainage, one option is a hypoglossal diet, which decreases the intake of
long chain triglycerides, preferring the short and medium chains. Another proposal
consists of oral fasting with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for one week and then
progressive introduction of food and lipids.</p><p>In the last years, new conservative options have been studied that corroborate with
the effectiveness of the nutritional restrictions. One option that has gained
credibility is the use of octreotide<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> and similar, such as sandostatin<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. Its mechanisms of action are still not clear,
but are believed to act in the splenic and hepatic circulation, reducing lymphatic
flow through octreotide receptors in this organ, reducing time and optimizing
treatment efficacy.</p><p>There are also surgical treatments, among them: direct ligation of the thoracic duct,
simple raffia of the fistulous area, use of fibrin sealants, pleurodectomy and
pleurodesis, and others.</p><p>Due to the lack of consensus and in order to minimize the differences between the
procedures adopted, Panthongviriyakul and Bines<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> developed an algorithm. This determines the accomplishment
of a conservative treatment associated to pleural drainage for two weeks and if
chylothorax persisted, then the surgical treatment would be applied<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Based on the importance of postoperative chylothorax in pediatric cardiac surgery, in
order to significantly compromise postoperative morbidity and mortality, we feel
stimulated to evaluate the evolution and results of the treatments used in our
institution in recent years, seeking to evaluate the treatments used, the changes in
these treatments over the years in order to corroborate the search for the best
therapeutic strategies to reduce the morbidity of chylothorax in the postoperative
period of pediatric cardiac surgery.</p><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>Primary</p><p>

in literature such as Mery et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. This same study reveals that the highest incidences of
chylothorax present in total cavopulmonary surgeries, similar to that found in our
study, in which Glenn also shows a high incidence, only behind of the total
cavopulmonary surgeries. Currently, the use of hypoglossal diet as a treatment of
chylothorax was abandoned in our Service given preference for fasting and possible
associations. In our service, the preference for fasting associated with TPN has
increased, and this study shows that 51% of the patients who received this
therapeutic option obtained clinical results in less than 14 days. The use of
fasting with TPN associated with octreotide also gained space, and it has been
administered in more than 30% of the studied patients, reaching resolution rates in
85.1% of cases. In our service we started with a dose of 1 mcg/kg/h in a continuous
infusion pump, with a maximum dose of 8 mcg/k/h. Cannizzaro et al.[1] also
demonstrated an efficient use of octreotide, reaching resolution levels around 50%.
The option to maintain chylothorax III diet in extra-hospital follow-up had its
highest rates in patients with clinical resolution above 15 days, which reveals a
good general condition for the patient discharge, requiring only follow-up and
progression of the diet at home. It is observed that the mortality of patients with
chylothorax is high and reaches more than 20% of the studied cases, which highlights
the importance of the search for more information and improvement of techniques
aimed in solving this complication.</p><p>Our study shows that, currently, the best strategy has been the association of
fasting with TPN, however, and it should be taken into consideration that the
association of octreotide after a week of trying only fasting and TPN has a high
resolution index and its use can be considered from the beginning of treatment with
the objective to reduce treatment time.</p><sec><title>Limitation</title><p>It is a retrospective study, with diversity in the treatments used, which makes
it difficult to define the best treatment. A prospective study comparing
treatment with fasting with TPN compared to fasting associated with TPN and
octreotide is necessary to evaluate whether the use of octreotide interferes
with the efficacy of treatment. In addition, it should be noted that in the
package inserts of medications such as Sandostatin there is still no formal
indication for its use in chylothorax.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The incidence of chylothorax in pediatric cardiac surgery in our service is 2.12%.
Chylothorax was more common in the postoperative period of total cavopulmonary
bypass (11.8% of the patients submitted to this surgery had chylothorax in the
postoperative period), followed by Glenn's operation (8.36%). Among the therapeutic
strategies used, fasting with TPN (51.72%) followed by the association of octreotide
(31.03%) initiated after treatment failure after one week of fasting. The use of
hypoglycemic diet was abandoned in our service. The therapeutic failure occurred in
22.2% of the patients in whom the therapeutic strategy was the hypoglossal diet,
2.2% in cases of fasting with parenteral nutrition and 3.7% in the group in which it
was associated with octreotide, evidencing the superiority of fasting in treatment
when compared to hypoglossal diet.</p><table-wrap id="t6" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="5%" span="1"/><col width="95%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th colspan="2" align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026;

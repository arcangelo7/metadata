Participants were sent an information leaflet, consent form, and vignette that depicted a patient (&#x02018;Sarah&#x02019;) disclosing physical violence from her partner (&#x02018;Danny&#x02019;) to a GP or PN. She also described his controlling behaviour towards their three children aged 7, 5, and 2 years. The vignette allowed for exploration of clinicians&#x02019; views on responding to DVA and child safeguarding even where their own experience was limited. Additional questions included how clinicians respond to the different family members, what they would document, and what actions they would take following disclosure.

<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;The difficulty with safeguarding is, is making sure that, you know, information is there so that people can access it &#x02026; so that no matter who goes into the records people know that there are safeguarding issues, because that&#x02019;s ultimately what our job is as GPs, is to safeguard the children and the family and obviously the mum of the children.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(GP 21, female, 45&#x02013;54 years)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>Just under half (<italic>n</italic> = 26) of the clinicians identified the importance of documenting DVA in children&#x02019;s EPRs. A further 13 clinicians said they would also document in the perpetrator&#x02019;s EPR. GPs discussed sharing this information to address related behaviours in the perpetrator such as mental health or alcohol consumption, or to provide an opportunity to challenge behaviour:
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;If we&#x02019;re aware of it</italic> [DVA] <italic>on his record then next time he came in about his drinking you could, well we would ask, you know, what kind of problems is this having, are you having any problems in your relationship, those types of things?&#x02019;</italic></p><attrib>(GP 22, female, 55&#x02013;64 years)</attrib></disp-quote>
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;In some ways it&#x02019;s quite a useful challenge to say &#x0201c;well look, you know, we&#x02019;ve been advised about this issue, we record it on all the patients&#x02019; records because that is our practice&#x0201d; by way of communication and if he didn&#x02019;t like it that&#x02019;s his problem &#x02026; Making him aware that we&#x02019;re all aware and that he&#x02019;s not going to get away with it.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(GP 12, male, 55&#x02013;64 years)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>Thirteen clinicians explicitly stated, however, they would not document DVA in the perpetrator&#x02019;s EPR. For some, this was because it was &#x02018;only&#x02019; an allegation (see above), but for many it was because of concerns about escalating abuse if the perpetrator discovered the disclosure in their EPR:
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;I wouldn&#x02019;t</italic> [document in perpetrator&#x02019;s EPR] <italic>because that partner</italic> [the perpetrator] <italic>has, has access to the notes</italic> [has the right to view his EPR] <italic>and, and the, the woman hasn&#x02019;t actually given you permission to do that, and that could cause, you know, could cause lots of problems and could put her at more risk.&#x02019;</italic></p><attrib>(GP 28, female, 55&#x02013;64 years)</attrib></disp-quote></p></sec><sec><title>A patient-owned record</title><p>No clinician discussed the EPR as a mechanism to empower patients or families experiencing DVA. Clinicians were aware that patients could request to see their EPR or their children&#x02019;s EPR. However, patient ownership and control of what is recorded was a difficult process:
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;</italic> [If] <italic>she doesn&#x02019;t want me to record it, I don&#x02019;t record it because obviously she would not want me &#x02026; that&#x02019;s a very difficult situation, I can do all in my power to try and persuade her, I can give the statistics how if it&#x02019;s physical but a lot of people do end up losing their lives &#x02026; If the children are affected I can actually override her I feel and contact the child safeguarding teams. If there are no children involved and it&#x02019;s just a woman, I, I don&#x02019;t think I can override her wishes unless she had a mental health problem and I felt she could be sectioned but I can&#x02019;t really, all I, it&#x02019;s very difficult.&#x02019;</italic></p><attrib>(GP 41, male, 45&#x02013;54 years)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>In contrast, another GP was aware that patients can access their notes, but this did not affect her decision to document as she felt the EPR is the property of the NHS:
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;You know, my view is that the patient record is, it doesn&#x02019;t really belong to them</italic> [the patient]<italic>, it belongs to the NHS and so it&#x02019;s still OK for me to document that stuff and if they</italic> [the perpetrator] <italic>look, well that&#x02019;s one of those things isn&#x02019;t it?

Five were extremely concerned, however, that patient ownership of their own records actually increased the potential for a coercive partner to get access to the abused partner&#x02019;s EPR:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;It is difficult because, you know, in theory you would only have access to your own information or, or whatever; however, if you&#x02019;re in a controlling relationship, you know, it&#x02019;s not going to be very difficult for somebody inappropriate to get hold of a, you know, your login details or whatever, so I certainly see that as a, a risk to individuals.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(GP 36, female, 45&#x02013;54 years)</attrib></disp-quote></p></sec></sec><sec><title>Tensions among the different roles of the EPR</title><p>Multiple roles of the EPR resulted in uncertainty regarding the best way to document. The main tension identified was that between confidentiality to protect the abused parent and information sharing for child safety.</p><p>Clinicians were worried that the EPR might be seen accidentally by the perpetrator, resulting in an escalation of DVA for both the abused parent and children:
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;We think there&#x02019;s a danger in them</italic> [the perpetrator] <italic>accessing those records and, and thereby making the victims more vulnerable.&#x02019;</italic></p><attrib>(GP 36, female, 45&#x02013;54 years)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>This led some clinicians to develop strategies to hide DVA documentation using code words and linking records using numbers:
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;What we would do is we would put it on</italic> [the perpetrator&#x02019;s EPR] <italic>as a &#x0201c;cause for concern&#x0201d;</italic> [code] <italic>but what we&#x02019;d often do, simply because sometimes patients can be left in a room with a computer on and their records up, would be to</italic> [write] <italic>&#x0201c;See record</italic> [and then give a record number]<italic>&#x0201d;. So you&#x02019;d just put like a &#x0201c;cause for concern&#x0201d; code on and then you&#x02019;d perhaps put a code through to Sarah&#x02019;s records rather than putting everything down.&#x02019;</italic></p><attrib>(GP 22, female, 55&#x02013;64 years)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>Clinicians&#x02019; concerns about confidentiality increased as the number of family members involved multiplied.</p><p>Another tension occurred regarding the clinicians&#x02019; uses of the EPR versus the patients&#x02019; access to the EPR:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;I think we write some things in some people&#x02019;s records that they shouldn&#x02019;t read and that&#x02019;s on a very individual basis and &#x02026; most people can read their records but I think in some situations they, there&#x02019;s some things people shouldn&#x02019;t read, and we&#x02019;re putting it on there to warn other people and, and that&#x02019;s to the benefit of the patient.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(GP 10, male, 35&#x02013;44 years)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>Therefore, some clinicians discussed sharing information while avoiding documenting in the notes by sending e-mails or private messages within the practice:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;I don&#x02019;t think I&#x02019;d put anything on the patient&#x02019;s records but I would discuss with the other clinical staff about the situation, so just let them know or, so that would probably consist of sending an e-mail round on our Outlook NHS e-mail or internal e-mail to the other clinicians, saying please could you look out for this patient&#x02019;s notes?&#x02019;</p><attrib>(GP 33, female, 25&#x02013;34 years)</attrib></disp-quote></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Summary</title><p>There is substantial variation and inconsistency in general practice clinicians&#x02019; documenting of DVA in families with children. For a minority of clinicians, this is because of a lack of knowledge and understanding regarding DVA. However, the majority of clinicians recognised DVA and its impact on child safeguarding, but struggled to work out the best way to document it. There was a tension between managing the confidentiality of the victim alongside the safety of the children. On the one hand, it was acknowledged that safety could be improved through continuity of care and information sharing. On the other hand, most clinicians recognised that abuse could escalate if the perpetrator discovered disclosure. In addition, clinicians were managing information governance requirements and legal concerns about full and accurate records. Clinicians also recognised patients&#x02019; rights to view their own records, with concerns about the consequences of patients accessing information about DVA. This led individual practices, and in many cases individual clinicians on an <italic>ad hoc</italic> basis, to develop complex mechanisms and strategies to hide information so that it was only available to other clinicians.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Focusing on how general practice clinicians document DVA in families illuminates the complexity and tensions between competing demands on the clinician. The intensive and wide-ranging recruitment strategy led to a large and varied sample of clinicians, resulting in thematic saturation despite the complexity of the topic area. Many responders did not have experience of domestic violence cases or training, reflecting the reality of general practice. The vignette allowed participants with little experience to discuss the topic; however, what clinicians say in response to a vignette may differ from their practice. Health visitors were not included in the present sample as the focus was on general practice. However, many of the responders discussed the role of health visitors in managing DVA in families with children (results reported elsewhere).<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with existing literature</title><p>Hester described three distinct policy &#x02018;planets&#x02019; that exert influence on the management of DVA in families with children: care and support for the victim; care and support for the children; and care and support for the abusive parent.<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Focusing on documenting in general practice demonstrates that clinicians are influenced by each of these competing conceptualisations of DVA. They describe documenting to provide continuity of care for the victim, to protect children, and as an opportunity to address the perpetrator&#x02019;s behaviour. However general practice clinicians are being influenced by, and need to respond in all three policy directions simultaneously, as well as non-DVA policies of information governance and patient access to records.</p><p>Previous research demonstrates that general practice professionals respond to different national policies by adapting them to local priorities, workloads, and resources.<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> In the absence of national and local guidance on how to document DVA in families, clinicians are developing their own often intricate methods of documenting based on their expectations of the role of the EPR. This is complicated by the development of separate mandatory training and documenting advice for each role of the EPR, developed in silos. This may explain some of the inconsistent documenting strategies, as individual clinicians in individual practices try to balance the competing &#x02018;planets&#x02019; and make sense of their work. Similar inconsistencies have been observed in general practice clinicians&#x02019; documenting of male involvement in DVA (E. Williamson, personal communication, 2016). This suggests the need for a wider, cohesive discussion of the role of the EPR.</p><p>With the advance of new technology, the EPR is increasingly seen as having a wide range of unforeseen effects.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The effect of the computer and more recently the EPR on the consultation in general practice has been described previously.<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Creswell and colleagues describe the EPR as an actor: <italic>&#x02018;... the source of an action regardless of its status as a human or non-human&#x02019;</italic>.<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> The EPR is one actor in a network with other human (clinician) and non-human (policies) actors. The interactions between the different actors shape the resulting action.<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> In this study clinicians, acting in a network with child safeguarding policy and the EPR, produce the action of information sharing. Creswell and colleagues found that the EPR can have different roles, with different meanings for different stakeholders depending on the context.<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Therefore in response to the same stimulus (the vignette), different clinicians form different connections with each policy &#x02018;planet&#x02019; and the EPR, to produce different actions and concerns. Adding in more actors, such as patients with online access, makes the networks more complex, resulting in unpredictable outcomes that can be different from those initially desired.<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> In the present study this resulted in clinician uncertainty: will documenting to share information result in the information being shared with the intended people, or unintended disclosure to a perpetrator and reduced safety for victim and children? The tensions described by clinicians result from both the complexity of DVA in families, and the uncertainty of working with a network of actors, including the EPR, policies, and patients, where actions may have unforeseen consequences. Online access to the EPR may become a tool of coercion for patients experiencing DVA; this has not been adequately addressed in terms of policy or technical solutions for hiding sensitive information.<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Implications for practice</title><p>Managing DVA in families with children is a challenge in general practice. Focusing on how clinicians document DVA in the EPR demonstrates the competing policy priorities acting on clinicians and the multiple potential actions triggered by documenting. Not only are clinicians being asked to care and support all members of the family, but they are also being asked to provide a legal record and a record for patient use. In the absence of national and local guidance, clinicians are developing individual strategies to balance these competing priorities. This is resulting in inconsistent and confused documenting strategies. There is a need for national integrated guidance on documenting taking into account all actions of the EPR. This should be supported by mandatory training covering how to respond to the female,<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> children,<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> and male<xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> victims. This is even more urgent given the move to online EPRs with patient access.<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> This has wider implications for documenting sensitive information in general. Further access to patient online records should not be made available without providing national safeguards and guidance about how clinicians can use the EPR safely to provide a legal record, continuity of care to vulnerable groups, and to share child safeguarding information. Potential solutions include flexibility within the EPR to have private and shared spaces, but this would require public agreement regarding the ownership of and access to their data. This needs to be done following a national conversation involving the public (both those with experience of DVA and those without), general practice clinicians, IT developers, and policymakers.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the general practices across England that participated in this pilot training and evaluation study.</p></ack><notes><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This article is independent research commissioned and funded by the Department of Health Policy Research Programme (Bridging the Knowledge and Practice Gap between Domestic Violence and Child Safeguarding: Developing Policy and Training for General Practice, 115/0003).

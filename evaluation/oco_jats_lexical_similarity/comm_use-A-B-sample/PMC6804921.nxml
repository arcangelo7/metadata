Its pathogenesis is still under investigation, and there is no effective disease-modifying therapy. Here, we report that elevated cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in the osteocytes of subchondral bone causes both spontaneous OA and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The knockout of COX-2 in osteocytes or treatment with a COX-2 inhibitor effectively rescues the structure of subchondral bone and attenuates cartilage degeneration in spontaneous OA (STR/Ort) mice and tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; transgenic RA mice. Thus, elevated COX-2 expression in subchondral bone induces both OA-associated and RA-associated joint cartilage degeneration. The inhibition of COX-2 expression can potentially modify joint destruction in patients with arthritis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Pathogenesis</kwd><kwd>Bone</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Health &#x00026; Human Services | NIH | National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR071432</award-id><award-id>AR063943</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Arthritis is a joint disorder that affects one or more joints. Osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are the two most common forms of arthritis. OA is characterized mainly by joint pain and stiffness that especially affects weight-bearing joints, such as the knee and hip.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> Muscle atrophy and joint deformities appear during the advanced stages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> RA is an autoimmune disease involving chronic synovial inflammation within the joints. Approximately 0.5%&#x02013;1% of the population has RA, and small joints are affected more frequently than large joints.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> RA is characterized by increased levels of inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;), interleukin-6, and interleukin-1, in the synovial joints.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> Currently, arthritis treatment focuses on controlling the symptoms, especially pain; there is no satisfactory prevention or cure. During the end stages of OA and RA, joint replacement is often necessary.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> OA is a costly and prevalent joint disease. OA is predicted to affect 67 million people in the United States by 2030,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and in developed countries, its treatment costs are between 1.0% and 2.5% of gross domestic product.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup></p><p id="Par3">Clinically, many OA patients have joint pain and degeneration with no history of trauma or other known causes. In addition to posttraumatic OA, there are other subtypes of OA with different pathogenesis. However, we have not been able to identify the different pathological causes of the subtypes of OA. Without identifying OA patients based on specific pathogenesis, it is difficult to develop disease-modifying therapies for clinical trials. Studying spontaneous OA in animals offers a unique opportunity to investigate the pathogenesis of nonposttraumatic OA. The STR/Ort mouse strain is an inbred substrain of STR/N mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> The origin of STR/Ort mice can be traced to 1951.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> Notably, the STR/Ort strain is prone to developing OA, which is characterized by subchondral bone sclerosis, osteophyte formation, and articular cartilage degeneration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> It is worth mentioning that male mice have a higher incidence of OA than female mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> Histologically, the lesions of STR/Ort mice closely resemble those observed in human OA. Previous studies have shown that OA lesions often develop in the medial tibia plateau of the knee joint rather than the lateral plateau.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> Thus, STR/Ort mice are a promising model for studying the potential factors involved in spontaneous OA.</p><p id="Par4">Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors selectively block the COX-2 enzyme and have been used to treat OA and RA with a low risk of adverse gastrointestinal effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> Blocking this enzyme impedes the production of prostaglandin (PG) E2, which is often the cause of pain and swelling during inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> PGs are enzymatically derived metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid. The crucial limiting step in PG synthesis is the enzyme that catalyzes the COX and peroxidase reaction. There are two isoforms of COX: COX-1 is expressed at relatively stable levels in most tissues and is considered constitutive, whereas COX-2 is an inducible isoform that is generally expressed at very low levels in most tissues but can be induced to high levels by multiple factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> COX-2 is more efficient than COX-1 at producing PGs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> As the most widely produced prostanoid in the human body, PGE2 is a well-known regulator of bone formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> Our previous study demonstrated that PGE2 activates PGE2 receptor 4 (EP4) in sensory nerves to regulate bone formation by inhibiting sympathetic activity throughout the central nervous system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> We have also demonstrated that uncoupled bone formation in subchondral bone induced by active TGF-&#x003b2; initiates the pathological changes of trauma-induced OA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> COX-2 inhibitors have been mainly used in the clinic for their anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects; however, the potential role of COX-2 in the pathogenesis of OA and the role of its inhibitors as disease-modifying treatments have not been studied. In this study, we explored the effect of COX-2 on subchondral bone and articular cartilage during the progression of arthritis. The knockout of COX-2 in osteocytes or treatment with a COX-2 inhibitor attenuated cartilage degeneration in spontaneous OA and TNF-&#x003b1; transgenic RA mice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Result</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aberrant subchondral bone formation in spontaneous OA mice</title><p id="Par5">To examine the pathogenesis of spontaneous OA, we sectioned the knee joints of STR/Ort mice at different ages for immunostaining analysis. The results showed that, relative to age-matched control CBA mice, significant proteoglycan loss occurred in the deeper zone of cartilage adjacent to subchondral bone from 4 months of age and was aggravated over time (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The tidemark moved up because of the decreased thickness of the hyaline cartilage zone and the increased calcified cartilage layer, as shown by hematoxylin and eosin staining (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The percentage of MMP13<sup>+</sup> chondrocytes increased significantly in 4-month-old STR/Ort mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b, c</xref>), suggesting that the articular cartilage degenerated in STR/Ort mice. Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) scores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> showed that significant articular cartilage degeneration started at 4 months of age in STR/Ort mice and progressed gradually relative to that in the age-matched CBA mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Aberrant subchondral bone formation in spontaneous OA mice. <bold>a</bold> Top: safranin O and fast green staining of sagittal sections of the medial tibial subchondral bone from STR/Ort (STR) and CBA control mice at 2, 4, and 6 months of age.

The subchondral bone volume (BV)/tissue volume (TV) ratio increased each month by more than 10% in STR/Ort mice, whereas the BV/TV ratio in CBA controls remained relatively steady after puberty (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). Furthermore, the increase in trabecular pattern factor (Tb.Pf) indicated a decrease in subchondral bone connectivity in STR/Ort mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>). Increases in the number of osteoclasts and transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;) activity in subchondral bone induce traumatic OA in mice that undergo anterior cruciate ligament transection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> However, as in CBA mice, there were no changes in tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)<sup>+</sup> osteoclasts or pSmad2/3<sup>+</sup> cells, which represent TGF-&#x003b2; signaling, in STR/Ort mice of different ages (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a&#x02013;c</xref>).

The increase in the bone formation rate and mineral apposition rate in calcein double-labeled bone confirmed subchondral bone formation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f&#x02013;h</xref>).

After washing three times with ice-cold PBS, the samples were decalcified at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C using 10% EDTA (pH 7.4) for 21 days and then embedded in paraffin. Four-micrometer-thick sagittal sections of the medial compartment of the knee were used for staining. The sections were stained with individual primary antibodies against COX-2 (ab15191, 1:100, Abcam), osterix (ab22552, 1:100, Abcam), OCN (M137, 1:100, Takara Bio Inc., Kusatsu, Shiga Prefecture, Japan), pSmad2/3 (sc-11769, 1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Dallas, TX, USA), and MMP13 (ab3208, 1:50, Abcam) at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C overnight. We used the horseradish peroxidase&#x02013;streptavidin detection system (Dako) to detect the immunoreactivity. Then, we counterstained the sections with hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich). We counted the number of positively stained cells in four random visual fields of the subchondral bone in five sequential sections from each mouse in each group. For OCN staining, we normalized the number of positively stained cells to the number of cells per millimeter of adjacent bone surface (N&#x000b7;mm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) in subchondral bone.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Calcein double-labeling</title><p id="Par25">To examine dynamic bone formation, we injected mice intraperitoneally with 0.08% calcein (Sigma-Aldrich, 20&#x02009;mg&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> b.w.) 8 and 2 days before euthanasia.

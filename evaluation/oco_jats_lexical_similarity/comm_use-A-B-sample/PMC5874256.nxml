However, they have rarely been used to understand lineage-specific pathways and functions that contribute to the trait. In this study, by integrating lineage-specific enhancers from mesenchymal and myeloid compartments with bone mineral density loci, we were able to segregate osteoblast- and osteoclast (OC)-specific functions. Specifically, in OCs, a PU.1-dependent transcription factor (TF) network was revealed. Deletion of PU.1 in OCs in mice resulted in severe osteopetrosis. Functional genomic analysis indicated PU.1 and MITF orchestrated a TF network essential for OC differentiation. Several of these TFs were regulated by cooperative binding of PU.1 with BRD4 to form superenhancers. Further, PU.1 is essential for conformational changes in the superenhancer region of Nfatc1. In summary, our study demonstrates that combining GWASs with genome-wide binding studies and model organisms could decipher lineage-specific pathways contributing to complex disease states.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="LongSummary"><title>Genetics: Cellular fate dictates osteoporosis risk</title><p id="Par2">Genetic variation in non-coding regions of DNA could raise osteoporosis risk by affecting osteoclast differentiation. Osteoporosis occurs when the normal process of bone remodeling by osteoblasts and osteoclasts falls out of balance. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with osteoporosis, but how these affect specific cell types was unclear. Sudarshana Sharma and Michael Ostrowski at&#x000a0;the Medical University of South Carolina and colleagues wondered if variations in non-coding &#x02018;enhancer&#x02019; regions of DNA, might shed light on the molecular underpinnings of osteoporosis. So, they overlaid SNPs associated with reduced bone mineral density onto enhancers in mesenchymal and myeloid cells&#x02014;the precursors of osteoblasts and osteoclasts&#x02014;identifying a transcription factor network in myeloid cells that drives the differentiation of osteoclasts.

However, using GWAS as an investigative tool to analyze complex traits by pairing it with large-scale genomics and animal modeling has been rarely performed.</p><p id="Par4">Osteoporosis is a multi-factorial disease that is well-studied using GWAS. Although historically associated with age-related hormonal deficiencies, other diseases, therapeutic agents, and lifestyle choices, GWAS studies have revealed that genetic polymorphisms are major contributors to osteoporosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> The deterioration in bone microarchitecture and decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) associated with osteoporosis results from abnormal bone remodeling, where there is a net increase in bone resorption when compared to bone formation. Bone remodeling is a process maintained by two key effector cells, bone-building osteoblasts (OBs) and bone-resorbing osteoclasts (OCs). Bone forming OBs originate from multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which also give rise to multiple other cell types including adipocytes, chondrocytes, myocytes, and fibroblasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> Within the OB lineage, runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) is perceived as the master regulator of OB differentiation and function. Multiple signaling pathways converge on and regulate RUNX2 activity, including the (1) TGF-&#x003b2;/BMP and (2) WNT pathways, ultimately regulating OB formation and activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> The only known bone-resorbing cells in the body, OCs are terminally differentiated cells of the hematopoietic hierarchy formed from myeloid precursor (MP) cells present in bone. Osteoblasts and other cells present within the bone microenvironment regulate OC activity primarily through secreting the cytokines colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) and receptor activator of Nf-&#x003ba;B ligand (RANKL). These cytokines activate signaling pathways in MPs that result in the increased expression of multiple transcription factors (TFs) essential for subsequent OC differentiation&#x02014;PU.1, MITF, NFATc1, cFOS, FOSL2, and NF-&#x003ba;B.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup></p><p id="Par5">The Ets family TF, PU.1, is the master regulator of the commitment of hematopoietic precursors to the myeloid lineage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and it has been shown in mouse models to be essential for MP commitment towards OC differentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> A known co-partner of PU.1 in OCs is microphthalmia-associated TF (MITF).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> PU.1 and MITF physically interact and have been shown to regulate the transcription of multiple genes necessary for OC function including <italic>Acp5</italic>, <italic>Ctsk</italic>, <italic>Oscar</italic> and <italic>Clcn7</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> Mice bearing various spontaneous MITF mutations support its requirement for proper osteoclastogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> Although the interplay between PU.1 and MITF in regulating key effector genes required for OC function is well known, the extent by which PU.1 and MITF affect the full course of OC differentiation is largely unknown.</p><p id="Par6">In this study, we investigated whether known BMD GWASs show an enrichment of SNPs affecting lineage-specific pathways and functions in OC differentiation. This was performed by overlaying SNPs identified in men and women that are associated with decreased BMD (BMD-SNPs) onto active enhancers in the myeloid compartment that are associated with PU.1 binding. We also conducted this analysis in the mesenchymal compartment using RUNX2-associated enhancers as a control group. This process segregated out discrete, lineage-specific molecular functions and biological processes important for OC and OB differentiation. In the myeloid compartment, functional enrichment analysis identified a network of PU.1-regulated TFs in both MPs and OCs. We subsequently used mouse models to show, for the first time, that conditional deletion of <italic>Pu.1</italic> in differentiating OCs results in severe osteopetrosis. However, when PU.1 is knocked down in MPs, there is an increase in osteoclast precursors (OCPs) that also fail to undergo OC differentiation. This phenotype results from a dysregulation of the OC TF network, which we demonstrate using functional genomic analysis of MITF- and PU.1-bound loci. Further, we show that TFs which govern terminal OC differentiation, including <italic>Nfatc1</italic> and <italic>Fosl2</italic>, are regulated by superenhancers cooperatively bound by PU.1 and the BET protein, BRD4. Finally, we identified a conserved PU.1-bound enhancer region in the first intron of murine <italic>Nfatc1</italic>, which requires PU.1 for conformational changes that bring distal enhancers closer to the transcription start site (TSS) of <italic>Nfatc1</italic> by means of chromatin looping.</p><p id="Par7">In summary, by utilizing disease-associated SNPs identified by GWAS in combination with functional genomics and mouse modeling, we have provided critical mechanistic insights into a complex TF network governing OC differentiation. This study highlights the importance and utility of employing large GWAS datasets as a filter to identify lineage-specific functions associated with a polygenic trait, such as osteoporosis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Meta-analysis of BMD loci predicts cell lineage-specific functions and pathways</title><p id="Par8">We implemented a pipeline aiming to identify lineage-specific pathways and functions utilizing the GEFOS BMD-SNP database and publically available chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) data on the mesenchymal and myeloid lineage-specific TFs, RUNX2, and PU.1, respectively.

In contrast, non-filtered enhancer-associated genes that overlapped with BMD-SNPs as well as lineage-specific enhancers that did not overlap with BMD-SNPs failed to enrich for known cell type-specific pathways (data not shown). Interestingly, the majority of TFs from our systems biology approach had similar expression kinetics during mouse and human OC differentiation, enabling and justifying our use of model organisms to test our hypothesis.</p><p id="Par21">PU.1 is exclusively expressed in cells of the hematopoietic lineage. Dynamic fluctuation in its expression dictates differentiation in a dose-dependent manner toward multiple cell fates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> This occurs by PU.1 interacting with, and regulating the expression of, multiple lineage determining and lineage function genes. During commitment to a particular cell lineage, PU.1 is highly expressed in myeloid cells, present in a lower, but still very important level in B lymphocytes, and even further downregulated in T and erythroid cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> With specific regard to myeloid cells, sustained high PU.1 levels favor macrophage over granulocyte development. When combined with the fact that PU.1 regulates multiple myeloid-specific genes during differentiation, PU.1 is considered to be the master regulator of myeloid development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> Multiple mouse models of PU.1 mutations or deletions have been reported. Although one model of global PU.1 deletion resulted in late embryonic lethality and the absence of B lymphocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> another yet similar mouse model experienced perinatal lethality within 48&#x02009;h of birth. However, this latter model demonstrated a very small number of mature macrophages and granulocytes in the spleen and BM when mouse lifespan was prolonged with antibiotic therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> When combined with a lack of OC formation and resultant osteopetrosis in the latter model, these cumulative findings are consistent with impaired myeloid development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup></p><p id="Par22">With the advent of conditional knock-outs, Polli et. al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> demonstrated that B cell-specific PU.1 deletion resulted in a normal number of B cells during all stages of differentiation. Therefore, we were interested whether PU.1 was indeed needed at all stages of OC differentiation. Although decreased OC differentiation following conditional PU.1 deletion in MPs in our study is anticipated based on historical results, our study demonstrates for the first time that PU.1 is also required for OC differentiation after MPs become committed OCPs. We demonstrated this through a reduction in OC differentiation following PU.1 deletion specifically in committed OC precursors using OC-specific <italic>CtskCre</italic>. This result demonstrated that, unlike in B cells, PU.1 is required throughout OC differentiation. Interestingly, both mice with disruption of the PU.1 DNA-binding domain and a more recent model with conditional disruption of PU.1 using the inducible <italic>Mx1Cre</italic> demonstrated inhibited maturation, but not proliferation, with accumulation of an abnormally large population of immature myeloid progenitor cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> Our finding of increased OCPs following MP-specific deletion of PU.1 which fail to differentiate into functional OCs is consistent with this finding. In total, these results illustrate the requirement of PU.1 during the entire course of OC differentiation.</p><p id="Par23">To evaluate the molecular basis of PU.1 regulation in OCs, we performed ChIP-Seq to identify specific PU.1 targets at different stages of OC differentiation. However, PU.1 occupancy was found near the majority of protein coding gene loci irrespective of the stage of osteoclastogenesis. Previously, we have shown that RANKL signaling targets the MITF-PU.1 complex through phosphorylation of MITF at serine 307 by p38 MAP-kinase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup> The phosphorylation switch correlates with the dissociation of the EOS repressor complex and recruitment of Swi/SNF complex to MITF-PU.1 target promoters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> Though MITF and PU.1 occupy these promoters irrespective of the stage of differentiation. Similarly, MITF ChIP-Seq in MPs and differentiating OCs demonstrated that like PU.1, MITF occupancy was observed in MPs and OCs alike. Further, substantiating our pre-genomics era hypothesis that PU.1 is the partner of MITF in MPs and OCs and that they genetically and physically interact,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> the majority of the MITF-bound loci overlapped with PU.1-bound loci. This hypothesis was also supported by our finding of an increased occurrence of the MITF E-box motif near BMD-SNPs in PU.1 enhancers (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). When genes that are regulated by PU.1/MITF-bound loci were overlaid with MP and OC gene expression data, TFs were identified as a major molecular function regulated by the MITF-PU.1 complex. The TFs that were identified by integrated analysis of MITF/PU.1 ChIP-Seq and gene expression analysis fall into two distinct subsets, those that favor OC differentiation, such as <italic>Nfatc1</italic>, <italic>Fosl2</italic>, and <italic>cFos</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>), as well as those that suppress OC differentiation (<italic>Irf8</italic>, <italic>Bcl6</italic>, and <italic>Runx1</italic>) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>). Of note, in PU.1 knockdown cells this regulatory loop is reversed, which favors the suppression of OC differentiation.</p><p id="Par24">Interestingly, the genes encoding several key receptors (<italic>Csf1r/cfms</italic>, <italic>Tnfrsf11a/Rank</italic>), TFs (<italic>Nfatc1</italic>, <italic>cFos</italic>, <italic>Fosl2</italic>) and OC markers required for differentiation and function (for example, <italic>Ctsk</italic>) reside in what are generally referred to as transcriptional hot spots or superenhancers (Supplemental Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). These closely-associated strong enhancers were bound by PU.1. Further analysis of two key TFs, <italic>Nfatc1</italic> and <italic>Fosl2</italic>, for the BET protein family member BRD4 revealed that these TF-encoding genes were regulated by superenhancers and exhibiting cooperative binding of PU.1 and BRD4. Recently, the BET inhibitor JQ1 has been shown to inhibit OC differentiation both in vitro and in vivo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup> Here we show that PU.1 is cooperatively bound to BRD4 in an interdependent manner, regulating key TFs required for OC differentiation and function. This finding substantiates earlier results implicating superenhancers as cell lineage determinants within the hematopoietic hierarchy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup> Our work provides a mechanistic basis for the recent suggestion for the use of BET inhibition to treat diseases associated with excessive OC activity, including osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup></p><p id="Par25">An interesting feature observed in these superenhancers was that many enhancer loci fall in distal intronic regions or intergenic regions. The presence of PU.1 at these loci irrespective of signaling indicated that PU.1 facilitates chromatin to be in a conformation enabling rapid induction of transcription when it is needed. The role of PU.1 in chromatin conformation has been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup> Our results at the <italic>Nfatc1</italic> locus substantiate the hypothesis that distal intronic enhancer loci loop back to more proximally located promoter locus. Although RANKL signaling had no effect on this looping event, PU.1 was essential in this process. Surprisingly, PU.1-Enh-BMD-SNPs identified by integrating human myeloid lineage ChIP-Seq with GWAS data from the GEFOS reside in this region. However, the nominal <italic>P</italic> values of these SNPs did not reach the significance threshold. These observations dovetail with our hypothesis that disease-associated SNPs in non-coding regions could shed light on important molecular pathways and functions involved in these diseases, even if a specific statistical significance threshold is not reached.</p><p id="Par26">In summary, by combining functional genomics, mouse modeling, and disease-associated SNPs identified by GWAS, we provide critical mechanistic insights into the regulation of a complex TF network governing OC differentiation. Our in vivo, in vitro, and functional genomic analysis reveals that PU.1 and its co-partner, MITF, regulate a set of TFs whose functions are essential for OC differentiation and function.

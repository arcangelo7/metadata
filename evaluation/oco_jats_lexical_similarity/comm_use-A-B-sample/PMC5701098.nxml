the focused journal. Therefore, we have designed this text oriented to three targets: 1)
What represents the year of 2011 for the Brazilian Journal of Cardiovascular Surgery
(BJCVS); 2) The BJCVS support for feasibility of trials, and; 3) The 50 years of heart
transplants.</p><sec><title>The Year of 2011: a Celebration and a Milestone</title><p>During the 25-year BJCVS celebrations in 2011, we had the first Impact Factor (IF)
published by ISI-Thomson Reuters. The prime number of 0.963, almost 1, at first
evaluation, shows the high degree of development of Brazilian cardiovascular
surgery. In an attempt to check the SciELO database and verify if it coincides with
the 25 years of the BJCVS, we observe the best academic performance of the BJCVS
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). It should be noted that this
performance was independent of international collaboration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>). This fact deserves careful evaluation to guide our
editorial planning.</p><p>
<fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>SciELO database: A) Journal self-citation is defined as the number of
citations from a journal citing the article to articles published in the
same journal; B) International collaboration accounts for the articles
that have been produced by researchers from several countries; C)
External citations are calculated by subtracting the number of
self-citations from the total number of citations received by the
journal's documents, and; D) SJR is a measure of scientific influence of
journals that accounts for both the number of citations received by a
journal and the importance or prestige of the journals where such
citations come from.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-32-05-000I-g01"/></fig>
</p></sec><sec><title>Protocol Trial</title><p>Recently, Rodrigues et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>
investigated in a Brazilian two-center study the relationship between pre-frailty
and adverse postoperative outcomes following cardiovascular surgery. The authors
emphasized that this group had more cumulative events than the non-frail group, both
in stroke and death rates, and that pre-frail patients had prolonged mechanical
ventilation time and hospital length of stay compared with non-frail patients. The
authors pointed out that these findings are strongly relevant and contribute to
understanding whether the extent of premorbid deficit accumulation adds prognostic
value after cardiovascular surgery. In this scenario, BJCVS was chosen by
Mej&#x000ed;a et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> as a vehicle
for the publication of the study protocol of the randomized controlled multicenter
FRAGILE trial, whose primary purpose will be to compare adverse cardiac and
cerebrovascular events after CABG (on-pump <italic>vs.</italic> off-pump) in
pre-frail and frail patients, inaugurating this new type of publication in our
medical journal (page 428).</p></sec><sec><title>Fifty Years of Heart Transplantation</title><p>This year we celebrate 50 years of the first inter-human heart transplantation. In
this edition, Prof. Noedir Stolf reviews the most important steps of this glorious
journey. Repeating his words: "Heart transplantation first performed in the course
of experiments of other nature at the beginning of 20<sup>th</sup> century, seen as
a speculation for the future in the middle of the same century, is now widely
accepted by medical and lay communities as a valuable therapeutic procedure." The
heart transplantation is one of the most exciting and remarkable chapters in the
history of cardiac surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Additional Articles in This Issue</title><p>This issue of BJCVS presents a selection of various articles that will surely please
their readers.</p><p>The following articles were chosen for publication: two articles on the use of
artificial cardiac stimulation; two articles on surgery in congenital heart
diseases; two articles related to aortic diseases; two comparative articles between
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and surgery, and; some general
aspects related to cardiac surgery (circulatory support, operations in Jehovah's
Witness patients, intensive care unit stay, aspects of heart surgery in the fragile
patient).</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The articles on electrical stimulation addressed two issues: one on the
evolution to atrial fibrillation with VDD and DDD pacemakers, and the
other on the implantation of cardioverter-defibrillators therapy in
patients with nonischemic heart failure.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The articles on congenital heart disease present a casecontrol on the
always exciting subject that is the formation of chylothorax as a
complication of the surgical correction of congenital heart
diseases.</p></list-item><list-item><p>On diseases of the aorta, we discuss the percutaneous coronary
intervention and drug-eluting stents or coronary artery bypass grafting
surgery for unprotected left main coronary artery stenosis.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Impact of myocardial revascularization method on smoking cessation: CABG
<italic>versus</italic> percutaneous coronary intervention is
another subject under discussion in this issue of BJCVS.</p></list-item></list>

and Dr. Cooley in 1969 first implanted devices in humans, mechanical circulatory support
(MCS) has reached maturity and is now widely used for the treatment of advanced heart
failure (HF).</p><p>Progress has been huge in recent years, with new challenges in candidate selection and
clinical management amid the ongoing debate on the cost-effectiveness use of a finite
financial healthcare resource, especially in countries like Brazil.</p><p>Circulatory support devices of the first phase of development always sought to create the
systolic-diastolic pressure differential. It was inconceivable to imagine a continuous
flow as a form of prolonged circulatory assistance. Thus, models such as Novacor,
Electrical HeartMate and others were developed to allow patients to reach cardiac
transplantation under improved clinical conditions.</p><p>Since the work of Richard Wampler and OH Frazier with Hemopump in 1988 at Texas Heart
Institute, when they brought the advent of rotary blood pump technology, continuous-flow
device therapy has emerged as a viable alternative in patients ineligible for cardiac
transplantation.</p><p>The advances in mechanical circulatory support have shared with that of heart
transplantation. Many of the decisions today in the treatment of heart failure are now
focused on choosing patients for cardiac transplantation, mechanical support, or
both.</p><p>Acute decompensated heart failure has emerged as a major public health problem over the
last decade. It is estimated that there are 1 million hospitalizations with a primary
discharge diagnosis of this syndrome annually, and that number is expected to increase
substantially over the next two decades. The American Heart Association estimated that
the prevalence of heart failure will increase 46% by 2030, resulting in more than 8
million people affected by the disease<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Heart failure has become the leading cause of hospitalization in people over 65 years of
age worldwide, even considering economic differences in countries. Reported death rates
appear excessive both during and after hospitalization, and readmission rates reveal
failure in effective long-term care. The direct costs associated with treating the 5
million Americans with chronic heart failure are mostly attributable to hospitalization.
The US government estimates spending more than $26 billion a year on treating patients
with heart failure. In Brazil, of all hospitalizations in the country, 21% are from some
etiology of heart failure<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The registry of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation reports the
short- and long-term outcomes of a heart transplant, with 1 and 10-year survival rates
of approximately 85% and 50%, respectively. However, the number of heart transplants,
both in children and in adults, had little improvement in the last few
years<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>With this disproportionate number of heart transplants and the increasing number of
patients with heart failure, ventricular assist devices (VADs) became the most common
surgical procedure to support failing circulation, outstanding the frequency of heart
transplant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p><fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Mechanical circulatory support device implants from 2006-2017 in the United
States</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-34-01-0III-g01"/></fig></p><p>The shortage of donor organs enforces the establishment of waiting lists and priority
allocation of patients. This shortage also encouraged the research for therapeutic
alternatives, with the possibility of helping circulatory support and prompt
availability when needed.</p><p>Improvements in device technology have made VADs an attractive alternative for the
treatment of end-stage HF. More reliable systems have enabled bridge to transplant (BTT)
therapy. The use of VADs for this group of patients is a Class IIa-C recommendation. An
increasing number of patients with end-stage HF who are ineligible for a transplant can
be implanted with VADs as destination therapy (DT), in order to improve survival and
quality of life (Class IIa-B recommendation)<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>As mentioned, the leading indication for LVAD therapy is no longer BTT but DT in patients
who are ineligible for a heart transplant. Deciding on either strategy requires an
evaluation of the patient's natural course with HF <italic>versus</italic> the patient's
chances of surviving the complications of LVAD therapy<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. Durable VAD therapy in
patients with end-stage HF demands a multidisciplinary approach in experienced
high-volume centers, with a transplant background. There is a constant 24/7 need.</p><p>In the 1990s, a large number of patients were bridged to transplant with LVADs. The
Randomized Evaluation of Mechanical Assistance for the Treatment of Congestive Heart
Failure (REMATCH) trial was published in 2001 and opened the era of DT in patients with
end-stage HF not eligible for a heart transplant<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Like we said, the first-generation VADs sought to create natural circulation by producing
pulsatile flow. The setup of the pneumatic chamber, driveline, controller and power
source was relatively big and noisy.</p><p>Second and third-generation pumps are focused on size, biocompatibility, durability,
effectiveness and infection issues. Miniaturization and improved efficiency were the
main drivers of developments. The new devices were more reliable with a reduced failure
rate.</p><p>The most important second-generation VAD, the redesigned HeartMate II (Abbott, St. Paul,
MN, USA), proved successful as a BTT device in a prospective multicenter study published
in 2007. Patients with end-stage HF improved after implantation of this device in terms
of functional status and quality of life. The FDA approved the HeartMate II as a BTT in
2008 and a DT in 2010. Clinical results after implantation of the HeartMate II improved
steadily to 85% 1-year survival<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. Patients with this continuous-flow device demonstrated
dramatically improved survival compared with patients on first-generation pulsatile flow
devices.</p><p>Third-generation LVADs generate continuous blood flow through a centrifugal pump design.
The first relevant third-generation LVAD is the HeartWare Ventricular Assist Device
(HVAD(r)) (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA), which allows intrapericardial and less
invasive implantation. The ADVANCE (HeartWare Left Ventricular Assist Device for the
Treatment of Advanced Heart Failure) trial<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> reported 86% 1-year survival after HVAD
implantation, with significant improvement in functional capacity and quality of life.
Based on this BTT evaluation, the HVAD(r) received FDA approval in 2012.</p><p>The HeartMate III is the latest third-generation LVAD, a centrifugal continuous-flow LVAD
with a fully magnetically levitated impeller. The MOMENTUM 3 (Multicentre Study of
MagLev Technology in Patients Undergoing Mechanical Circulatory Support Therapy with
HeartMate 3) study compared the HeartMate III with the axial flow pump HeartMate II; the
follow-up data are promising. The important finding was that none of the patients with
HeartMate III experienced a pump thrombosis<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. This complication is probably restrained
by the design of the pump, which is characterized by the relatively large housing of the
impeller and by the intermittent creation of at least some 'pulsatility' by the
automated rotational speed variation. The implantation techniques for the
third-generation centrifugal CF pumps preserve the pericardial integrity. Whether this
advance will help prevent short-term and long-term right HF is still unknown.</p><sec><title>COMPLICATIONS</title><p>RIGHT VENTRICULAR FAILURE is a major factor for the mortality rate among patients
with an LVAD, particularly in patients who are at Intermacs levels 1 and 2 at the
time of implantation. The risk of death after LVAD implantation due to RV failure is
highest in the early postoperative period. Late-onset right ventricular failure
contributes to morbidity and mortality after initially successful LVAD
implantation.</p><p>PUMP THROMBOSIS is a serious complication requiring either surgical pump exchange or
systemic thrombolysis. Although each of these options is technically feasible, each
one results in a large reduction in the 1-year survival rate compared to that with a
primary implant. The obvious increase in LVAD thrombosis may be explained by the
significantly longer support duration with centrifugal devices. Adherence to
standard anticoagulation recommendations can result in a reduction in the risk of
pump thrombosis.</p><p>BLEEDING COMPLICATIONS, mainly gastrointestinal, are a great risk of death after VAD
implantation. The occurrence of major bleeding may approximate 23%, with a
recurrence of nearly 10%. It remains a question if and how the long-term continuous
flow contributed to the development of arteriovenous malformations and bleeding
events.</p><p>DEVICE-RELATED INFECTIONS remain a common cause of morbidity and mortality in
patients with VADs. Transcutaneous drivelines obviously facilitate ascending
staphylococci-dominated infections. The incidence of device infections varies
between 13% and 80%. There is data today supporting the decrease of this
complication with recent devices.</p><p>NEUROLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS represents the most devastating risk of death in the mid-
to long-term after LVAD implantation. This risk stays constant throughout the first
4 years after LVAD implantation. Previous cerebrovascular accident, hyponatremia,
low albumin levels, elevated right atrial pressure, enlarged right ventricular
end-diastolic dimensions, atrial fibrillation, postoperative infection and
supratherapeutic anticoagulation levels correlate with the incidence of
cerebrovascular accident.</p><p>DEVICE MALFUNCTION 50% of patients with a VAD experience device malfunctions other
than pump thrombosis within 1 year postoperatively. The durability and functionality
of LVADs are influenced by numerous factors, including implantation technique,
anatomical constraints and complications such as infection and bleeding,
anticoagulation, pump settings and device design. Centrifugal pump devices have
demonstrated improved durability compared with pulsatile devices in studies with up
to 24 months of follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>PERSPECTIVES</title><p>Transcutaneous energy transfer system and better biocompatibility could probably be
the most important factors in the near future for VADs. This kind of advances will
be capable of yielding better quality of life with reduced risk of complications for
this population of patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Go</surname><given-names>AS</given-names></name><name><surname>Mozaffarian</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Roger</surname><given-names>VL</given-names></name><name><surname>Benjamin</surname><given-names>EJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Berry</surname><given-names>JD</given-names></name><name><surname>Blaha</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><etal/><collab>American Heart Association Statistics Committee and Stroke

Deficits of approximately 21% have been identified in the eccentric hip adduction strength of footballers who have hip and groin pain.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Furthermore, eccentric hip adduction (EHAD) strength programmes have demonstrated reductions in hip and groin injuries.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The ratios between EHAD and eccentric hip abduction (EHAB) may also impact on injury risk.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;8</xref> An EHAD:EHAB ratio between 1.25 and 1.6 is thought to reduce the injury risk to footballers.<xref rid="R6"

of injury prevention programme in professional football is low.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Post exercise muscle soreness has been linked with reduced compliance to prevention protocols.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> This may be a reason why prevention programmes such as the Nordic programme have been limited in professional football.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Muscle soreness and fatigue require longer recovery and may decrease performance levels in footballers.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Another challenge with implementing injury prevention programmes is the required dose needed to elicit the desired outcome, and when best to complete such protocols as to not impede on training and matches.</p><p>The Copenhagen adduction (CA) protocol is a graduated eccentric training regime that strengthens hip adduction and optimises the EHAD:EHAB ratio.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Developed by

To ensure standardisation, all MPCA sessions were supervised by the same two researchers: the lead researcher (GP), a physiotherapist with experience within professional football, and a strength and conditioning coach (AB), who was part of the club&#x02019;s sports science and medicine team that developed the MPCA exercise. All levels and progressions were adapted from the original CA exercise.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The MPCA programme incorporated six progressive levels, specifically designed for this study, from an assisted isometric adduction hold (level 1), progressing incrementally to a full CA exercise (level 6). Level 1 is a submaximal isometric contraction; it had the lowest post exercise muscle soreness and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) when piloted with the sports science and medicine staff. Participants had to be able to perform each exercise to the satisfaction of one of the researchers before progressing to the next level (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Needing a break when doing an isometric hold or being unable to control the eccentric element of the CA exercise is a reason to repeat the current level. The MPCA exercise was completed over an 8-week period. Participants completed two sessions per week, with difficulty and volume progressing incrementally. Participants progressed from two to three sets and from 6 to 10 repetitions, dependent on which level they were completing (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig"

All sessions were part of the activation completed before on pitch training, which enabled high compliance. A larger sample incorporating multiple football clubs from different leagues could have strengthened the sample. Although similar results have been observed in subelite under 19 football teams,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> it is not known if female footballers or athletes from differing sports would gain similar benefits.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Strength changes and the literature</title><p>The MPCA exercise demonstrated significant strength changes in EHAD bilaterally, which were above the MIREDIF of 15% commonly used in the literature. This is in line with other strengthening studies with an 8-week duration.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 15 16 21 23</xref> Although the baseline EHAD strength was greater than normative data values measured for professional footballers,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> the MPCA exercise was still able to elicit strength changes of 25% over an 8-week programme. This suggests the MPCA exercise was challenging enough for participants to use in season, without negatively affecting training sessions or competitive matches. The minimal exercise dose (ie, number of sessions, sets and repetitions of each exercise) needed to elicit similar strength changes is not known. However, the current study has shown a lower and progressive exercise dose can elicit strength changes that are comparable with other studies, while reducing post-training DOMS scores and maintaining high compliance rates. The fact that sessions were completed prior to training may be a reason why strength gains have been seen while completing a lower dose of exercise.</p><p>Previous studies have linked strength levels with reduced injury prevalence,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and one study showed that athletes that completed a CA programme had reduced groin problems by up to 41%.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Therefore, CA training may reduce adductor-related injury risk in footballers. However, further research is needed to corroborate this in the professional setting. A review of adductor-related injury incidence following the MPCA exercise would be of use to further support the current evidence.</p><p>Although the CA exercise is a hip adduction strengthening exercise, abduction strength gains have been seen. This is due to an activity of 48% of maximal voluntary isometric contraction through the hip abductors, which has been shown using surface electromyography activity.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> This may be of additional benefit due to a further indicator of injury risk being the EHAD:EHAB ratio.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The mean baseline EHAD:EHAB ratio in this study was 1.12, which increased to 1.24 right and 1.26 left, respectively. An EHAD:EHAB ratio between 1.2 and 1.6<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> is viewed as optimal to reduce injury. Therefore, the MPCA exercise may reduce the adductor-related injury risk in elite male footballers.</p><p>Without the use of a control group, definitive conclusions cannot be made. Throughout the study, the players completed their &#x02018;normal&#x02019; strengthening programme in addition to the MPCA exercise. This included exercises such as squats, hip thrusts, Romanian deadlifts and assisted Nordic exercises, among others. Specific adductor strengthening exercises were also not controlled for, and some participants may have completed additional adductor strengthening exercises. It could be the case that the increases in strength may be attributed to the players normal programme. However, the strength gains are seen across the participants, and the MPCA exercise was the only specific adductor strengthening exercise done.</p><p>One constraint of the current protocol is the need for equipment in the form of a box or a bench. However, the equipment needed is inexpensive and common among sports teams. Another limitation of the current protocol is the concern that level 5 could cause potential stress at the medial knee. In the current study, this was not reported by any participants and did not affect the compliance rate. A further limitation of the study was the decision to use a mean of three strength tests. This is a minor change to the testing protocol that was followed, which included piloting. However, the amount of error is not clear based on previous studies<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 15</xref> and may influence the reproducibility of the study.</p><p>The current MPCA exercise is focused on the adductors. In a real-world setting, football clubs require a prevention programme for all common injuries in football. It is therefore proposed that the MPCA exercise form part of a prevention programme to reduce the overall risk of injury to a professional footballer.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>An MPCA exercise has been shown to increase EHAD strength and to optimise EHAD:EHAB strength ratio in professional footballers&#x02019; midseason. Postintervention EHAD strength increases and EHAD:EHAB strength ratios met the threshold that have been associated with reduced risk of groin problems and adductor-related injuries.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;8</xref> However, this study did not have a long enough follow-up to accurately measure the injury prevention effect. Therefore, future research should focus whether the MPCA exercise can prevent adductor-related injuries in senior professional footballers and athletes in other sports.</p><p>DOMS and RPE scores were low throughout the study, suggesting the MPCA exercise can be incorporated into football training programmes without negatively affecting performance.</p><p>The small study size may limit extrapolation of the results to other populations. However, there have been other similar small studies completed on differing populations, such as semiprofessional, or development U19 footballers, which have had similar results. This may infer the protocol could be of benefit to all levels of football. However, further assessment of the MPCA is needed to review the benefit to female footballers or athletes from other sports.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Twitter:</bold> @georgepolglass</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> The lead researcher, GP, completed the planning, conduct and reporting of the work described in the article.

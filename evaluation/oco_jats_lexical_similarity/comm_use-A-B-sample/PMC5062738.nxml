Cardiovascular Surgery (BJCVS).</p><p>This has been a special year for all of us of the Editorial Board, besides celebrating
our 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary we are deeply restructuring the BJCVS.</p><p>In July 2015, during a meeting of the Board of the <italic>Sociedade Brasileira de
Cirurgia Cardiovascu</italic> lar (SBCCV), we decided that the administrative system
of the BJCVS should be directly managed by the SBCCV, which allowed a deep and systemic
view of the journal and, measures could be taken, to reorganize the edition system and
the administrative process.</p><p>After a year under this new management system, we can say that things are being
organized. The change in nomenclature was formalized, the BJCVS can now be found on the
Thomson Reuters website by its name in English: Brazilian Journal of Cardiovascular
Surgery. All of you can access the website and enjoy the performance of your article in
this database, from which the impact factor (IF) is calculated.</p><p>You just need to enter the link: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://goo.gl/VBhrgi">http://goo.gl/VBhrgi</ext-link>, click "Sign in
Web of Sciences", fill out the form or do log in, with your name and password.</p><p>On the next page, go to "Basic Search", type the journal name in English and select the
index: Publication Name and "SEARCH". The articles appear in chronological order from
the newest to the oldest, but there is a floating box that allows several
possibilities.</p><p>Browsing the page, you will find a lot of important information, such as number of
citations and viewing statistics.</p><p>As we want that BJCVS become known in many different strata, we updated our presence in
all indexing bases. All failures in the editorial processes were identified and remedied
by implementing a work schedule involving the chief editor, associate editors,
reviewers, authors and the entire team of the BJCVS and SBCCV, with the responsibility
of strict adherence to deadlines.</p><p>A checklist to optimize productivity was prepared, ensuring the reduction of time between
manuscript submission and article publication.</p><p>Aimed at internationalization, we are working to bring the BJCVS to international
standards and, from July, the authors must submit their manuscripts through the
"ScholarOne" system, a platform used by the major journals in the world, a tool with a
simple interface that will make it easier for authors and to editorial board, as well as
allowing speeding up the entire review process. The BJCVS has now a blog with
interviews, publication of interesting articles and works related to cardiovascular
surgery together with tips for publications.</p><p>Despite many positive changes, there are still challenges to be overcome, such as to
incentive the graduation and post-graduation institutions, encourage the authors to
publish their scientific productions in the BJCVS, steadying our scientific and
educational nature, among other important actions. We are convinced that all efforts
made until now and those still to come, will bring good medium-term results, as the
increased visibility of the BJCVS, with increased number of readers and citations, and
consequently, increase of the "Thomson Reuters", IF. We would like to give special
thanks the Board of the SBCCV that, at all times, are partners in our great fight, and
in particular, the Editorial Board of the BJCVS, the authors, volunteers and reviewers,
who work with primacy to give for the readers what is best in scientific production of
our specialty.</p><p>We are proudly working to pave the way for the next 30 years of the BJCVS; after all, we
are still the only Scientific Journal on Cardiovascular Surgery, with IF in the Southern
Hemisphere!</p><p>We expect that the same enthusiasm permeates all our partners, because the most visible
part of the work of each of us focuses on the BJCVS, our visiting card around the
world!</p><p>Kind regards</p><sig-block><sig><bold>Domingo M. Braile</bold><break/><sup>1</sup>Editor-in-Chief - BJCVS</sig></sig-block></body></article>

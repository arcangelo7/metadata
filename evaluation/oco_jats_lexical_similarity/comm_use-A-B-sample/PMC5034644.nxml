Reporting of AFP in children younger than 15 years is followed by laboratory diagnosis of stool specimens to either confirm polio or identify non-polio AFP cases. Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome cases are classified as non-polio AFP cases. Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome is the most common non-polio cause for AFP. Most countries achieve or surpass the global standard of an annual rate of at least one case of non-polio AFP per 100&#x02009;000 population of children younger than 15 years. </p><p>In 2015, globally, 99&#x02009;582 AFP cases among children younger than 15 years, including 72 laboratory-confirmed wild poliovirus cases, were reported. AFP surveillance in countries of the WHO Region of the Americas detected Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome at an annual rate between 0.8 and 1.1 per 100&#x02009;000 children younger than 15&#x000a0;years.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> One study based on a review of published papers between 1980 and 2008 estimated that the global all-age incidence rate for Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome ranges from 1.1 to 1.8 cases per 100 000 people per year. The incidence rate among children younger than 15 years varied from 0.34 to 1.34 cases per 100 000 people per year.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Several reported Zika virus cases from the 2015 and 2016 outbreak have also been linked to Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Further investigation of AFP cases classified as being due to Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome can be a starting point to test for Zika virus.</p><p>Existing polio surveillance systems in countries collectively present a platform for global disease detection, monitoring and response.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> As these surveillance systems have matured, health officials have increasingly applied them to detect other priority diseases, like measles. A key objective of the <italic>Polio eradication and endgame strategic plan 2013&#x02013;2018</italic> is to maintain the legacy of the polio eradication programme by ensuring that key assets such as AFP surveillance infrastructure are preserved and used for other epidemic-prone diseases.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> The AFP system is fully equipped with trained personnel at national and subnational levels, either with designated surveillance medical officers and/or surveillance focal points, to detect, report and respond to suspected cases of AFP. The system has reporting mechanism from subnational to national level. Trained staff are acquainted &#x02013; and programmes are equipped &#x02013; with surveillance protocols for AFP and other diseases. The surveillance system is supported with adequate laboratory facilities from national, regional or international laboratory networks. In many countries governments pay for the system from their national budget, while in others it is supported by international organizations, partners or donors. </p><p>The system provides an infrastructure to monitor the incidence of Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome in children younger than 15 years, and to facilitate surveillance for Zika virus infection in all ages. In addition, symptomatic cases of Zika virus infection present with symptoms like fever and rashes, which are common for measles, dengue and chikungunya; many countries have surveillance systems for such cases, which can be adapted for Zika virus surveillance.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Triangulating the AFP cases with fever and rash cases could increase the sensitivity and specificity of Zika virus infection detection; however, this hypothesis requires further research.</p><p>To enhance monitoring, we suggest that AFP surveillance officers in areas where <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> is present should immediately notify the detection of clusters of AFP cases diagnosed as Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome, or if there is an increase in the number of AFP/Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome cases above the previous baseline for the area. <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes exist on all continents.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref>

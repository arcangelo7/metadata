cases of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), whereas the occurrence of isolated CIA
aneurysms is very rare<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The literature has shown that use of endovascular techniques to treat AAAs results in
lower intraoperative and short-term morbidity and mortality rates. However, dilation
of one or both CIAs prevents adequate distal sealing, which compromises the success
of the procedure<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Although treatment of CIA aneurysms that coexist with AAAs has not yet been
standardized<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>, several
endovascular techniques are available, which can be divided into those that either
sacrifice or preserve hypogastric flow<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>. The techniques
that sacrifice hypogastric flow have a disadvantage in that they can cause buttock
claudication, sexual dysfunction, and ischemic colitis<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Of the various techniques that preserve hypogastric flow, the bell-bottom technique
is commonly used<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>. This consists of placing a
bifurcated stent graft extension as far as the bifurcation of the CIA; this
extension has a larger diameter in its terminal section so as to promote proper
coaptation with the wall of the dilated artery. Thus, hypogastric flow can be
preserved and complications from ischemia can be avoided<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. This technique requires a shorter operation time
and is associated with a lower rate of complications compared with other
techniques<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>; however,
more data are needed to evaluate the long-term outcomes of this procedure to treat
CIA aneurysms in patients with AAAs. The aim of this study was to analyze the
occurrence of endoleak, dilation, and the need for reoperation during a oneyear
follow-up period after the procedure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>This is a retrospective study with a convenience sample whose was approved by the
Ethics Committee of our institution (006/10).</p><p>Patients who were treated with bifurcated bell-bottom stent grafts to repair an
infrarenal AAA of atherosclerotic etiology that had &#x0003e; 1.5 cm dilation of at least
one CIA were included. The patients were monitored for at least 12 months after the
endovascular intervention.</p><p>All patients were referred for the proposed treatment based on the diameter of the
AAA, and all underwent the same surgical technique<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>. The
CIA dilation was treated by inserting bell-bottom extensions measuring 16 mm, 18 mm,
20 mm, 22 mm, or 24 mm, according to the size of the treated artery.</p><p>The diameters of the AAA and right and left CIAs were measured from computed
tomography (CT) scan performed before and at the time of the procedure. CT scans
were also performed at follow-up visits to measure the diameter of the aneurysm and
document any endoleaks and the need for reoperation. These visits took place one,
six, and twelve months after the procedure. After one year, patients were monitored
with ultrasound every six months. In cases where the ultrasound examination showed
dilation of the aneurysm or endoleaks, a new CT scan was obtained<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Data on the number of comorbidities and the presence of systemic arterial
hypertension, heart disease, cancer, chronic renal failure, dyslipidemia, and
peripheral vascular disease and diabetes mellitus were also collected.</p><p>Endoleaks were classified according to their origin. In type I, the anchor points may
be proximal (IA) or distal (IB). Type II are caused by refilling of the aneurysmal
sac from the aortic collateral vessels. Type III originate from a partial or
complete decoupling or fractures of components of the modulated stent and cause
persistent flow within the aneurysmal sack. Type IV endoleaks are associated with
porosity of the endograft.</p><p>The statistics used included analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare &#x02265;
three groups, and Student's t test or chi-square test to compare two groups.
Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to establish possible correlations
between these age, comorbidities, and artery diameter before treatment. The
correlation coefficient was classified as: strong (&#x0003e; 0.75), medium (&#x0003e; 0.5), or
low (&#x0003c;0.5). A significance level of 5% (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) was adopted
for all statistical tests.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Thirty-eight patients (34 men and 4 women) with a mean age of 70.4&#x000b1;8.2
years had bifurcated bell-bottom stent graft placement to treat an infrarenal AAA
associated with dilation of at least one CIA. Eight procedures were performed on the
right iliac artery, 17 on the left iliac artery, and 13 on both of the CIAs.
Therefore, 21 procedures were analyzed for the right iliac artery and 30 for the
left iliac artery. The average diameter of the treated arteries was
2.1&#x000b1;0.4 cm, ranging from 1.5 cm to 3.2 cm and the distribution of sizes
of stent-grafts used was: 12% of 16 mm, 39% of 18 mm, 29% of 20 mm, 12% of 22 mm and
8% of 24 mm.</p><p>The stent-grafts used were Talent (66%), Zenith (18%), Apollo (13%) and Anaconda
(3%). There were no thrombus or significant calcification in the distal landing zone
of bell-bottom extension.</p><p>Endoleaks were observed in 9 CIAs (17.6%), consisting of 6 of the 30 left iliac
arteries (20%) and 3 of the 21 right arteries (14.3%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). There was a statistically similar distribution in frequency
of endoleaks between the two arteries (x<sup>2</sup>=0.02;<italic>
P</italic>=0.887). The characteristics of patients who had endoleak and/or need to
be re-operated are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>,

with AAAs. However, endovascular techniques that preserve hypogastric flow are
associated with a reduced frequency of complications, such as buttock claudication,
sexual dysfunction, and ischemic colitis<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Placement of a bell-bottom stent graft is one of the endovascular techniques that
preserves hypogastric flow<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> and
was initially used to treat CIAs with diameters ranging from 1.5 cm to 2.4 cm. This
technique has been used for a decade now, even in arteries with large diameters, and
the results have compared favorably with other techniques<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>. However, there are few reports on the medium- and
long-term outcomes of this endovascular procedure in patients with CIA aneurysms
associated with AAAs.</p><p>This study evaluated the results of 51 endovascular procedures using the bell-bottom
technique to repair CIA aneurysms associated with AAAs in 38 patients. The patients
were predominantly men (89%), with a mean age of 70.4&#x000b1;8.2 years, a mean
of 2.1&#x000b1;1.1 risk factors, and a median follow-up of 25.8 months.</p><p>In this sample of CIA aneurysms associated with AAAs, left common iliac artery
(58.8%) was involved more often, whereas both CIAs had aneurysms in 13 patients
(34.2%). A similar prevalence of bilateral involvement (32.2%) was also observed by
Parlani et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> in a sample of
59 patients.</p><p>England et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> evaluated the
outcome of CIA aneurysms treated using this technique over a median follow-up period
of 24 months (range, 1-84 months). They compared 87 arteries with a diameter of &#x0003c;
1.8 cm and 30 arteries ranging from 1.8-2.5 cm in diameter. The results were
statistically similar for both groups of patients with respect to endoleaks
following the procedure. The authors reported three cases of type IB endoleaks
(2.6%); the one-year reoperation rate was 8% for the smaller-diameter arteries and
16% for the larger-diameter arteries. They suggested that treatment of dilated CIAs
with a diameter &#x0003e; 1.8 cm is associated with an increased risk of intervention. In
our study, despite a similar average follow-up period, the results showed a higher
overall rate of endoleaks (17.6%) and the need for reoperation (15.7% of procedures)
than in their study, with 1.9% of reoperations occurring in the first year after
treatment, 3.9% in the second year, 3.9% in the third, and 5.9% after more than
three years. Despite the higher rate of complications, we observed no association
between a greater initial artery diameter and endoleaks and/or the need for
reoperation.</p><p>Our results also showed higher rates of type IB (7.8%) and II (9.8%) endoleaks, and a
15.7% rate of reoperation when compared with the results of Torsello et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>, who reported a
3.4% and 2.2% rate of late-onset type IB and type II endoleaks, respectively. In
that study, both endoleak types were accompanied by artery dilation in patients
whose age and initial arterial diameter were similar to those in our study. For
Torsello et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> , the
reoperation rate at five years was 8.4%. However, Adiseshiah et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> argued that type IB endoleak
rates would be more frequent with this type of endovascular treatment than those
reported by Torsello et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>,
implying that the lower complication rates they observed could be attributed to the
shorter follow-up time. The same factor may also explain the higher rate of
endoleaks and the need for reoperation in our study, since our patient follow-up
period was considerably longer.</p><p>Kirkwood et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> evaluated the
results of endovascular treatment of CIAs during AAA repair performed in 671
patients at various centers, and monitored the patients annually for five years.
They subdivided the study population according to the maximum pretreatment diameter
of the iliac artery (&#x0003e; 2.0 cm and &#x0003c; 2.0 cm). The authors observed that iliac
artery dilation after treatment was not different between these two subgroups, so
that the initial diameter did not seem to affect postprocedure dilation. However,
adverse events of greater severity occurred more frequently in patients whose
arteries dilated after treatment, regardless of the initial diameter of the iliac
artery involved. Dias et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>
treated AAAs with branched stent grafts to preserve hypogastric flow and reported a
reoperation rate of 18% after a mean follow-up period of 20 months. We note that
there is considerable variation in the endoleak and reoperation rates reported by
different authors. However, as we found in this study, most authors report that
there was no significant difference when comparing groups stratified on the basis of
the initial aneurysm diameter and endovascular technique used. This variation is
probably due to the lack of a consistent follow-up period, along with differences in
patient's baseline characteristics such as age and the number of risk factors.</p><p>In our study, endoleak rates were not associated with the mean age of patients. In
contrast, reoperation rates were significantly more frequent in younger patients
(mean of 65 years) and in those with a greater number of risk factors (mean of 2.9
risk factors). Furthermore, we found that patients with three associated risk
factors had a significantly lower mean age (<italic>P</italic>=0.022) than those
with one or two risk factors (<italic>P</italic>=0.050). We should first consider
that older patients with more associated risk factors may not have had the
opportunity to receive this type of treatment due to the problem of survival.
Another possibility is that younger patients had longer follow-up; however, there
was no significant correlation between patient age and follow-up time.</p><p>Patients who required reoperation were monitored for an average of
36.8&#x000b1;23.1 months, which was statistically similar to the follow-up time
of patients with a favorable outcome (23.7&#x000b1;12.2 months). In the case of
endoleaks, whether they were re-operated or not, no significant difference in
follow-up time was observed between the patients with our without endoleaks;
however, it is important to recognize that the follow-up time in cases with
endoleaks was significantly greater than the follow-up time in cases with good
outcomes (38.1&#x000b1;26.1 <italic>vs.</italic> 23.1&#x000b1;9.9 months,
<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001).</p><p>According to Adiseshiah et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>,
type IB endoleaks are more common with endovascular treatment using the bell-bottom
technique in patients who are monitored long-term (<italic>i.e.</italic>, with
follow-up periods of &#x0003e; 5 years). In our study, out of the four cases with type IB
endoleaks, two were observed at 11 and 14 months postoperative, and the other two
were recorded at 69 months post-treatment and reflect a single patient who had
bilateral involvement of their CIAs. Similarly, considering all types of endoleaks
observed in this series, there was one case in the first year, two in the second
year, three in the third year, and another three after approximately six years;
overall, 66.7% of endoleaks were observed within the first three years following
treatment. Furthermore, when analyzing endoleaks and reoperations as a subgroup of
complications, we noted a significant, albeit weak, positive correlation (r=0.40)
between follow-up time and the occurrence of such complications.</p><p>In 2001, Sahgal et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> analyzed
changes in the diameter of 35 isolated CIA aneurysms with a follow-up period ranging
from 13 to 72 months after endovascular treatment. The mean diameter of these
aneurysms before treatment was 4.6&#x000b1;1.6 cm, and 94.3% had a mean reduction
of 1.1&#x000b1;0.6 cm at a mean follow-up time of 31 months. The mean reduction
in the first year of follow-up was 0.5 cm. The cases where aneurysm diameter
increased, at 18 and 24 months post-treatment, were initially larger than 5 cm and
evolved toward rupture.</p><p>In 64.7% of our cases, the treated arteries had the same diameter or experienced a
20% reduction compared with the initial diameter, and these changes were not related
to followup time, pretreatment arterial diameter, or patient age. In the remaining
cases (35.3%), we noted an increase in the diameter of the treated arteries ranging
from 4% to 168% (mean, 48&#x000b1;26%) compared with pretreatment. In these
cases, the diameter increase averaged 16% in the first year, 29% in the second year,
57% in the third year, and 95% from the fourth year until the end of follow-up. The
increase in aneurysm diameter showed a significant positive correlation with
follow-up time, and a negative correlation with patient age. It should be noted that
all cases of reoperation involved dilation &#x0003e; 40% compared with the pretreatment
diameter.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>The design of this study does not allow the evaluation of the impact of
bell-bottom stent grafts extension in a diseased artery, <italic>i.e.</italic>,
it was not possible to observe if the largest diameter of the extensions is
associated with increased vessel dilation as a consequence.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Treatment with bifurcated bell-bottom stent grafts to repair infrarenal AAAs with
associated CIA dilation is a good therapeutic option to preserve hypogastric flow,
however, when 38 patients were treated with this method, 17.6% developed endoleak
and 15.7% required a reoperation. In addition, this technique can lead to aneurysm
enlargement after repair in 35.3% of cases. Artery dilation compared to pretreatment
size was, on average, 16% within the first year, 29% during the second year, 57% at
the third year, and 95% as of the fourth year, postoperatively.</p><table-wrap id="t6" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="10%" span="1"/><col width="90%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th colspan="3" align="left" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GJPT</td><td colspan="2" rowspan="1">Conception and design study; realization of operations

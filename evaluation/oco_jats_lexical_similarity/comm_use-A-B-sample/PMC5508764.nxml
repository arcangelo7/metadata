The best way is of course to avoid such contracture by means of non-surgical treatment such as use of a growth factor. The basic fibroblastic growth factor is clinically well proven in decreasing scar formation and improving healing. There are numerous reconstructive methods for neck contracture, especially when the lesions are relatively limited in part of the neck. However, a very severe and full circumferential scar contracture requires extensive reconstruction. The thin groin flap is one of the answers and well matches with the tissue texture and maintains the flexibility. Even with extensive burns and delayed reconstructions due to resuscitation first, the groin area is well preserved and can be safely harvested by dual vasculature systems of the superficial circumflex iliac artery and superficial epigastric artery, which warrant more reliability compared to the perforator flaps in this area. More demanding and stringent forms of the neck burn scar contracture are the sequelae of radiation. A radiation burn or radiation injury can be progressing and hard to heal. Adipose-derived stem cells can reverse the scar contracture as the surrounding tissue is softened and can accelerate wound healing.&#x000a0;In this review, different types of neck burn scar contracture and reconstructive methods are summarized, including innovative use of bFGF and ADSCs in the management of difficult wound healing and scar contracture.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Neck scar contracture</kwd><kwd>Anatomical locations</kwd><kwd>Prophylaxis</kwd><kwd>Severe scar contracture</kwd><kwd>Thin groin flap</kwd><kwd>Radiation injury</kwd><kwd>Adipose-derived stem cell</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par3">A neck contracture may result in severe impairment of function and deterioration of esthetics.

In a series of 11 cases, age 5 to 14&#x000a0;years, post-burn anterior neck contractures were reviewed in an attempt to develop a new approach for reconstruction with local scar-fascial flaps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">The severity of the contracture was divided into three grades: (1) mild to moderate, which is of smooth cervicomental angle, restricted neck extension but a normal distance between the chin and the sternal manubrium angle; (2) severe, which is of mouth cervicomental angle and shortened distance between the chin and manubrium; (3) fusion, obliterated chin-manubrium and chin fused with manubrium. The timing of surgery varies from 1 to 5&#x000a0;years after injury. Elimination of the contracture and restoration of the neck contour are the evaluation factors. The benefit in eliminating long and complicated surgical procedures leads to a better outcome of contracture therapy.</p><p id="Par9">Two trapezoid scar-fascial mobilize all components of the anterior neck including scars, fat, platysma, and deep fascia, which enabled elongation of the length from 100 to 200%.

The flap is growing, while the reduction of skin grafting of the severe contractures in the submandibular and above the clavicles is minimal. The scar release procedure can exceedingly become more enlarged than planned in advance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and the patients with a burn contracture itself necessitate awake fiber-optic intubation, use of intubating laryngeal mask airway, intubation without neuromuscular blocking agents, intubation with neuromuscular blocking agents after testing the ability to ventilate by mask, pre-induction neck scar release under local anesthesia and ketamine, or sedation followed by direct laryngoscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>The lateral neck contracture</title><p id="Par10">In review of the lateral neck contracture, a series of 21 patients of lateral neck contracture, 10 males and 11 females, aging 6 to 43&#x000a0;years old were operated 1 to 3&#x000a0;years after burns, and anatomy and cause of contractures were investigated to determine the type to treat with local flaps. Surgical results were evaluated with functional range of motions and contour. The authors conclude that any contracture is created by the folding, in the areas of which there is an excessive surface and the neighboring surface and anterior neck surface, could be a donor site. Therefore, the local-flaps technique should be considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In local flaps, either adipose or adipose-scar trapezoid flaps are insisted superior to other local flaps such as V-Y flaps, Z-plasty, triangular flaps in V-Y plasty, or free flaps or pedicle flaps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], when the tissue is excessive in the surface and enables the excessive tissue to be used for scar release.

Radiodermatitis or radiation injury can be considered a severe form of the burn consequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Radiodermatitis is categorized in two phases. In the acute phase, it begins with redness or erythema, swelling or edema, and pigmentation. It is often reported with increased cutaneous sensitivity and tightness, which may lead to late (chronic) fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In greater doses, the patient may develop dry desquamation together with dryness, pruritus, and peeling off of the skin. More increase in dose of ionizing radiation, more frequently moist desquamation is observed.</p><p id="Par13">Months to years after an incident, the chronic phase arises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

In view of functional reconstruction, the ideal duration of the bFGF is proposed maximally 3&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The bFGF is effective in minimizing the scars with a dermal component such as a deep dermal component [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] but also brings better scar quality when used in the staged procedure; artificial dermis is preceded for wound beds, which is confirmed both by subjective and objective parameters and measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In radiation injury, the tissue may be impaired when increased susceptibility and flap survival may be reversed by the topical administration of bFGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].

Many surgical techniques have been attempted and failed to define the therapeutic guideline or algorithm. In review of 24 patients, by the third post-operative month, soft tissue cervico-mandibular (CM) angles significantly decreased, while both osseous CM and dynamic angles defined by full extension and full flexion, are significantly increased. Soft tissue CM angles are considered static markers, and affected by multiple factors and could be a pit fall into masked disfigurement. Either descriptive or quantitative, CM angle is a very important hallmark both for normal and neck contracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and once impaired, both function and esthetics are prominent. In order to obtain better outcome, platysma manipulation is stressed to achieve a proximal muscle flap that is returned and stabilized to the border of the lower mandible as this is able to augment the submental region, angulate the soft tissue CM angle, and escape from recurrence of contracture. Additionally, the lower muscle can be turned down to surface the scar region at the distal cervicothoracic junction and facilitate skin graft.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Thin and malleable flap reconstruction for severe and extended scar contracture</title><p id="Par19">It is highly important to replace the deficit resulting in the scar contracture by sufficient amount, malleable enough, and color- and texture-matched tissue.

Also, the superiority of this flap compared to the perforator flap is that two anatomically stable pedicles could be candidate for the pedicle vessels, i.e., the superficial branch of the superficial circumflex iliac artery (SCIA) and superficial epigastric artery (SEA).

Delayed pressure and positioning of the neck after skin grafting can result in an earlier and more frequent need for neck reconstruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. However, a malleable and extensive flap may restore more effectively than skin grafting and may lead to better outcome.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par29">The neck is an integral part of the major organs in breathing, mastication, phonics, and glands of endocrines such as the thyroid and parathyroid and the salivary glands.</p><p id="Par30">Facial expressions can also be determined in the facial muscles in the face and the neck. Once impairment in pediatric period occurred, subsequent effects to motion, growth, and smile are enormous in psychiatric drawback as well as objective impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. In adult extensive burns, the neck might be less attentive as initial treatment is attempted in resuscitation and much easier areas, which may result in the delayed start of treatment and lead to severe contracture although the incidence is lower compared to other joints in extremities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The most important strategy is to avoid the severe neck contracture sequelae by careful treatment in a timely manner. In partial thickness burns, growth factor treatment leads to faster wound closure, less scarring and thus better quality of wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">In the severe neck contractures, many reconstructive options are proposed including local [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and free flaps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and combination with tissue expansion. However, in very severe cases, the donor sites can be hardly found.

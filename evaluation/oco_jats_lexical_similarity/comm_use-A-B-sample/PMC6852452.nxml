refractory angina and myocardial failure, caused a frenzy in clinical research in the
late 1990&#x02019;s and early 2000&#x02019;s. Experimental reports have shown marked improvements in
myocardial contractility in heart failure models, and increased myocardial perfusion or
even myocardial replacement after necrosis in ischemic models.</p><p>More than 200 clinical trials were produced, but the experimental effects could not be
reproduced. Indeed, an improvement in cardiac function as well as some angiogenic
reperfusion have been observed at the clinical level, but those effects were light and
temporary, not sufficient to represent a usable therapeutic tool. The reasons for that
are an actual challenge to researchers.</p><p>There are many hypotheses for stem cell therapy failure in clinical therapy. Animal
experiments are done in young individuals and outcomes are evaluated invariably at short
term. Cardiac diseases are present in older patients, in whom stem cells are also old
and submitted to pharmacological effects of therapeutic drugs. Potent and prolonged
improvements are necessary to influence clinical outcomes, differently from what can be
achieved in animal research. Those could be some of several explanations.</p><p>The mechanism of action of stem cell therapy is also under exploration. The elements
responsible for the effects need to be better understood. Cellular proliferation,
paracrine effects, and delivery of cell elements or components are theories to be
studied. Proliferation has been demonstrated as not feasible in clinical level.</p><p>Some considerations should be brought to mind.</p><p>There are two main types of stem cells. Pluripotent stem cells, capable of
differentiating in any type of mature cells, of existing in the blastocyst, and can also
be produced by genetic reprogramming (induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPS
cells)<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. And adult or somatic
stem cells, which exist in all organs and are responsible for maintenance and repair of
adult tissues. The therapeutic potential of both types of stem cells in heart diseases
is under investigation.</p><p>The therapeutic use of adult stem cells started over 50 years ago, with bone marrow blood
transplantation for hematological diseases. During the last 20 years, the potential of
adult stem cells to treat non-hematological diseases has been widely investigated, and
the mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) has emerged as a promising therapeutic candidate in
regenerative medicine.</p><p>MSCs are undifferentiated cells able to self-renew and to give rise to cells with mature
mesenchymal phenotypes. Although they are more usually isolated from the bone marrow
and, more recently, from adipose tissue, they reside in virtually all tissues, where
they have an active role in the repair of focal injuries<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. When MSCs are isolated from the organism and
cultivated in vitro, which is usually necessary for therapeutic use, they lose their
stemness, which led to a proposal to change their name to multipotent mesenchymal
stromal cells. Their therapeutic effect is exerted mainly by the secretion of bioactive
molecules with supportive, antiapoptotic, angiogenic, chemoattractant, antiscarring, and
immunomodulatory functions. Extracellular vesicles, sized 80-1000 nm (microvesicles) and
50-200 nm (exosomes), were described as the mediating factor in MSC secretion<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>MSCs are the most widely used cells in regenerative medicine. A search in the
clinicaltrials.gov database shows more than 1,000 clinical trials using this cell type.
A recent review<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> described the use of
MSCs in orthopedic, degenerative, autoimmune, and inflammatory diseases, as well as in
immune rejection of allogeneic transplantation. Results show that this type of cell
therapy is safe, but actual data on its efficacy are often preliminary.</p><p>In the case of heart diseases, the first animal studies showed improved cardiac function
after cell therapy, and a great number of preclinical trials were performed with similar
results. Bone marrow cells were used in most cases, but soon the existence of endogenous
cardiac stem cells (CSCs), known as c-kit+ cells, was proposed by Piero Anversa's group.
Later work by other groups have casted doubt on the existence of a CSC, and more
recently Anversa et al. had papers retracted or with &#x0201c;expression of concern&#x0201d; by the
publishers<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. The retraction
of those papers as result of a Harvard University investigation of scientific misconduct
produced a strong negative impact in the field. But, also, could have explained why most
of the results by that group could not be reproduced by others.</p><p>A great number of clinical trials for heart diseases, using bone marrow or cardiac cells,
have been completed, are ongoing, or have been approved worldwide, including reports
from our group<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. The results
uniformly show that there are mild and transitory effects in myocardial improved
contraction and perfusion, and they are not sufficient to change clinical outcomes.</p><p>There are still paths to be explored, however. Pluripotent stem cells can be
differentiated in vitro in any type of functional cell, and then used for tissue repair.
Menasch&#x000e9;, one of the first groups to publish clinical series of stem cell therapy
in cardiac diseases, reported a recent 18-month phase I study demonstrating safety and
increased systolic function in heart failure patients after transplantation of embryonic
stem cell-derived cardiovascular progenitor cells embedded in fibrin patch<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>. iPS cells, however, are the
pluripotent stem cells more extensively studied, due to the easiness of production and
mainly to the fact that they are genetically identical to the donor patient. Their use
in disease modelling and cell replacement therapy is under intensive study, but still
emerging in the clinical setting<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. A
summary of our experience on stem cell research has been recently published<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Another path is the exploration of what has been named as &#x0201c;cell-free stem-cell therapy&#x0201d;,
a series of reports that study the mechanisms of action of cell-derived elements, like
extracellular microvesicles, exosomes, mitochondria, proteins, nucleic acids, and
possibly others, which could be isolated, purified, concentrated, and applied over the
failing or ischemic myocardium. Besides being more efficient, those elements might have
significant practical advantages over intact cells, as they can be managed similarly to
pharmacological drugs, produced and stored in quantity for timely
administration<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In summary, despite the great attention, research time and resources invested in clinical
trials using MSCs or CSCs for heart diseases, which are still going on, a consensus is
building on the inadequacy of this therapeutic approach. The scientific community is
being urged to "refocus the attention of the cardiac regeneration field on more
promising approaches"<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>. Stem cells
may still be a great solution, but not by the transplantation of adult cells. The
approaches of iPS cells and cell-free therapy are under study and could bring answers in
the future.</p></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Takahashi</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Yamanaka</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic and

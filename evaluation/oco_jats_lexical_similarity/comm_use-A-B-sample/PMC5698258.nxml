Although inflammation contributes significantly to osteoporosis, the underlying mechanism is unclear. In this study, we found that tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1;, an inflammatory environment mimic, inhibits osteogenesis of bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), induces miR-146a and decreases Smad4. Moreover, overexpression of miR-146a inhibited the osteogenic ability of BMSCs, whereas blocking miR-146a partially rescued the osteogenesis deficiency under TNF<italic>-</italic>&#x003b1; treatment. Molecularly, miR-146a decreased Smad4 expression at the protein level by binding to an element located in the Smad4 3&#x02032;-untranslated region, and restoration of Smad4 reversed the inhibitory effects of miR-146a on osteogenesis. Together, our results showed that the inflammatory environment mimic TNF<italic>-&#x003b1;</italic> inhibits osteogenesis via upregulation of miR-146a and subsequent downregulation of Smad4, thus suggesting that therapeutic manipulation of miR-146a maybe a potential strategy to improve osteogenesis in the context of osteoporosis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Osteoporosis, a systemic and multifactorial disease leading to morbidity and mortality among the elderly, is increasing in prevalence worldwide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> Bone fractures due to fragility are the most common consequence of osteoporosis, thus placing the elderly at risk for loss of independence, chronic pain, a need for rehabilitation, and excess mortality, especially when hip fractures are considered.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> Moreover, fragility fractures cause significant social, economic, and individual burdens owing to prolonged hospitalizations, medical treatments, limitations in activities of daily life, and demand for healthcare assistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> Inflammation is elevated in the osteoporosis patients, especially in diabetic and menopausal patients. Accumulating evidence has revealed the negative role of inflammation in osteogenesis of bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). Among the inflammatory cytokines, TNF<italic>-</italic>&#x003b1; is considered a major factor in osteogenesis inhibition under inflammatory conditions. For example, TNF-&#x003b1; has an extremely broad spectrum of biological activity and has a central role in many inflammatory diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> Research has shown that increased TNF-&#x003b1; strongly contributes to the inhibition of osteogenic differentiation, thus resulting in bone loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> Furthermore, TNF-&#x003b1; induces bone destruction by promoting osteoclast differentiation and inhibiting osteoblast differentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> However, the detailed downstream mechanism of how TNF<italic>-</italic>&#x003b1; leads to osteogenesis defects remains poorly understood.</p><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small noncoding ~22-nt RNAs that recognize target mRNAs by interacting with recognition sites in the 3&#x002b9;-untranslated regions (UTRs) and subsequently post-transcriptionally repress target gene expression. miRNAs have been reported to have a crucial role in maintaining bone development and metabolism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> Recently, several studies have identified the roles of miRNA in regulating BMSC viability, aging, and differentiation. Complex regulation of various miRNAs is critical for the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs into mature osteoblasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> Multiple miRNAs and their targets have been characterized. For example, miR-153 suppresses the osteogenic differentiation of human BMSCs by targeting bone morphogenetic protein receptor type II.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> MiR-21 promotes osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs via the PI3K/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> Further identification and characterization of the key miRNAs involved in the regulation of osteogenesis in the context of inflammation would shed light on developing therapeutic strategies for osteoporosis, especially given the targetable traits of miRNAs. Recently, we and others have found that miR-146a is a target of TNF<italic>-</italic>&#x003b1;/NF<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B signaling in other cell types, such as myocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> and astrocytes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> thus suggesting a possible role in regulating osteogenesis of BMSCs under inflammation.</p><p>In this study, we tested the effects of TNF<italic>-</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>

We found that increased miR-146a by TNF-&#x003b1; results in deficient osteogenesis, owing to inhibition of Smad4, a key player in the BMP signal pathway. Our present data suggest that therapeutic manipulation of miR-146a may potentially be a strategy to improve osteogenesis in the context of osteoporosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Isolation, culture, and identification of BMSCs</title><p>C57Bl6 mice (8-week-old male) were obtained from the Animal Laboratory Center of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China. The animals were maintained under specific-pathogen-free conditions and handled in accordance with the NIH Animal Care and Use Committee Regulations. All procedures were in accordance to the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Briefly, total bone marrow was flushed with culture medium from the mouse femora and pelleted before being seeded into 25&#x02009;cm<sup>2</sup> culture flasks with complete BMSC culture medium [Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM)/F12 (1:1; Gibco St. Louis, MO, USA)] supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco), 1% penicillin/streptomycin(Gibco) at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. After 3 days of incubation, the non-adherent hematopoietic cells were discarded with the culture medium, and the adherent cells were considered BMSCs. The culture medium was replaced every 3 days thereafter. Approximately 7&#x02013;9 days after seeding, the cells became nearly 80% confluent. The adherent cells were released from the dishes by using 0.25% trypsin (Gibco) and expanded at a 1:3 dilution. At passages 3&#x02013;5, BMSCs were used in all subsequent experiments.</p><p>For cell characterization, expression of specific cell surface markers for BMSCs were detected by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). CD105, CD90 and CD44 are known markers for BMSCs, and CD45 is a marker for hematopoietic cells. In addition, CD34 is a marker for hematopoietic cells and is partially expressed in certain BMSCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> Cells were detached by trypsin incubation, rinsed with phosphate buffered saline, and then incubated with fluorescence-labeled antibodies (CD105-FITC, CD90-FITC, CD45-FITC, CD44-FITC or CD34-FITC; BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA).

There were more cells in S phase after TNF<italic>-</italic>&#x003b1; treatment, as compared with the control, as revealed by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and b</xref>).

Bioinformatics analysis with TargetScan revealed that Smad4, an essential regulator of the BMP signal pathway, might be a target candidate of miR-146a. In agreement with the dose-dependent increase of miR-146a by TNF<italic>-</italic>&#x003b1;, Smad4 expression gradually decreased with increased TNF<italic>-</italic>&#x003b1; concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a and b</xref>). In addition, the endogenous Smad4 expression was decreased by miR-146a overexpression and enhanced by the miR-146 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). Strikingly, there were no obvious changes in Smad4 mRNA after overexpression or knockdown of miR-146a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>).To clarify the detailed mechanism how miR-146a regulates Smad4, the 3&#x002b9;-UTR reporter and its mutant form were constructed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Luciferase reporter data revealed that miR-146a inhibited the wild-type reporter activity but had no effect on the mutant form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). To further confirm the role of miR-146a in BMP signaling, the BMP signal luciferase reporter pGL3 BRE Luciferase was assessed. Our results indicated that miR-146a inhibited BMP2 reporter luciferase activity, whereas restoration of Smad4 significantly rescued the inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>). Overall, these data indicated that miR-146a inhibits BMP signaling by repressing Smad4 expression through interaction with the 3&#x002b9;-UTR in a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism.</p></sec><sec><title>Restoration of Smad4 rescues the effects of miR-146a on osteogenesis</title><p>The above analysis established the existence of a TNF-&#x003b1;-miR-146a-Smad4 regulatory axis in the BMSCs under inflammatory conditions.

The miRNAs themselves are also believed to be regulated by multiple growth factors, cytokines and hormones. miR-146a is a well-known target of inflammation.

Smad4 may not be the only target of miR-146a. Other downstream targets might be also involved in the function of miR-146a, given that miRNAs usually have multiple targets.

It has also been reported that miR-146a regulates osteogenic differentiation by downregulating SMAD2 and SMAD3 in human fetal femur-derived skeletal stem cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> All these data clearly support the osteogenesis inhibitory role of miR-146a. miRNAs function as potent molecular managers that may simultaneously regulate multiple endogenous signaling pathways, and miRNAs and RNAi have been proposed as rational gene-specific therapies for certain disease. We here revealed that miR-146a functions as a potent osteogenesis repressor by decreasing Smad4 expression. Thus, inhibition of miR-146a may promote bone regeneration <italic>in vivo</italic>. Notably, the BMSCs used in this study were bulk cells rather than sorted stem cells, and thus, future experiments with sorted BMSCs would further strengthen this conclusion, although most of the unsorted cells were BMSC marker positive, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Notably, previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have suggested that the inhibitory effect of TNF<italic>-</italic>&#x003b1; on osteoblast differentiation results from inhibition of IGF-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">(ref. 23)</xref> and the key osteoblast differentiation transcription factors Osterix<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> and Runx2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> Thus, it is of interest to determine whether the TNF<italic>-</italic>&#x003b1;-miR-146a-Smad4 axis directly alters the expression of IGF-1, Osterix and/or Runx2 at the transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional levels. Specifically, it would be of interest to search for Smad4 response elements in the promoter regions and miR-146a recognition sites in the 3&#x002b9;-UTR region of these genes.</p><p>It is now widely recognized that developing effective delivery systems is key to miRNA/RNAi-based therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> Primary stem cells are more difficult to transfect than immortalized cell lines, and thus, delivery of miRNAs in the context of bone regeneration maybe a major obstacle for future experimental and clinical studies. In addition to low cytotoxicity and high transfection efficiency, an ideal miRNA delivery system for regenerative medicine should be able to deliver the miRNAs to specific cells, tissues or organs in a local and sustained manner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> Targeted delivery of miR-146a or other potential miRNAs <italic>in vivo</italic>, which may provide a way to maximally mimic the native bone development environment, is underway and would open an avenue for osteoporosis and related disease therapy. Thus, further clarification of the status of the miR-146a-Smad4 axis in clinical osteoporosis patients or in an ovariectomized mouse model would shed light on targeting this axis as a potential therapeutic strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we provide the first evidence that<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> miR-146 expression of BMSCs is significantly increased under TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> treatment. Increased miR-146a expression in turn inhibits osteogenesis, thus at least partially explaining how inflammation augments osteoporosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> miR-146a decreases osteogenic differentiation by post-transcriptionally downregulating Smad4, an essential mediator of the BMP pathway. Further clinical analysis of miR-146a-Smad4 in patients with osteoporosis should demonstrate the clinical relevance of the current study and thus shed light on osteoporosis prevention and therapy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81570803), Guangzhou Foundation for Science and Technology Planning Project, China (201704030083), Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province, China (2017A050501013) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (17ykjc21).</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="bib1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">Reginster J-Y, Burlet N. <article-title>Osteoporosis: a still increasing prevalence</article-title>. <source>Bone</source>

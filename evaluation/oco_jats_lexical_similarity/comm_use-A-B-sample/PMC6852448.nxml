</p><p>In early 1938, a thin and frail 17-year-old boy arrived in Rio de Janeiro, coming from
the small town of Carmo de Minas, in the southern part of Minas Gerais.</p><p>Fatherless since two years old, he was full of plans and dreams, but was in doubt if he
should follow a path in medicine or engineering. At the last minute, he made his
decision, and after being approved in the college entrance exams, he enrolled in the
Brazil's National Faculty of Medicine, where he graduated as a doctor in 1948.</p><p>Less than 20 years later, Domingos Edgardo Junqueira de Moraes became the first Brazilian
surgeon to perform an open-heart operation in Rio de Janeiro and the second in all Latin
America.</p><p>Over the course of those two decades, Domingos became Fernando Paulino's first resident
at the Casa de Sa&#x000fa;de S&#x000e3;o Miguel, and he would go on to become a surgeon in
what was then considered one of the best hospitals in the country.</p><p>He was admitted to the IAPC and began performing lung surgery with Professor Odorico
Rocha.</p><p>In 1954, he attended the 2<sup>nd</sup> World Congress of Cardiology in Washington DC.,
and was amazed by the round tables where Gross, Crafford, Blalock, Gibbon, and Lillehei
presented the first sketches of a newborn specialty - cardiac surgery.</p><p>Leaving his wife and two young children behind, and on unpaid leave from two jobs, he
went to the USA, where he spent a year and half in Philadelphia, with Robert Glover, and
six months in Minnesota, commuting between Minneapolis, under the tutelage of Lillehei,
and the Mayo Clinic, with Kirklin.</p><p>Domingos realized that the system used by Lillehei was more adequate for Brazil. He
acquired the plans for DeWall's bubble oxygenator and bought a Sigmamotor pump financed
by his boss, Fernando Paulino.</p><p>Back in Brazil, he assembled a bubble oxygenator and began experimenting with it in dogs.
He operated on 19 animals with a survival rate of over 80%, then he decided that the
next operation would be on a human patient. On September 23, 1957, he successfully
operated a 31-year-old patient suffering from a VSD. In that year, he operated four more
patients, one of them underwent a Fallot Tetralogy correction, and all procedures were
successful.</p><p>In the early stages of these experimental surgical methods, Domingos began to add saline
to the prime volume of the oxygenator and the pump system. He noted that the survival
rates in animals remained the same. Thus, he began to dilute the filling volume of
patients with saline. It was a brilliant idea, which became known as &#x02018;hemodilution&#x02019;. He
published his invention in the Revista Brasileira de Cirurgia (Brazilian Journal of
Surgery) in 1960. Soon after that, others had the same idea; Zuhdi, in Oklahoma, and
Cooley, in Houston, also published studies on hemodilution in 1962 in widely circulated
medical publications.</p><p>In 1964, Domingos and his team moved to the Silvestre Hospital. There they had room to
expand their activities. Taking advantage of the hospital's workshop, Domingos, Waldir
Jazbik, and a mechanic called Gilberto Santos built a roller pump and created a
stainless steel bubble oxygenator to replace the outdated DeWall's helix oxygenator. In
his first month at the new hospital, Domingos implanted a Starr-Edwards prosthesis to
replace a mitral valve ravaged by rheumatic disease. Soon after that, he did the same
thing on an aortic valve. Both procedures were the first of their kind in Rio de Janeiro
and one of the firsts in Brazil. In 1965, he was also the first to install an
implantable pacemaker in Rio de Janeiro.</p><p>Domingos was a man who never took his victories and achievements for granted. He was an
innovator and he was always open to suggestions. In addition to being the first
Brazilian surgeon to adopt the bubble oxygenator, he soon began to associate hypothermia
with cardiopulmonary bypass. He was among the first surgeons to adopt arterial return
directly into the aorta, rather than return it through the femoral artery. Between 1961
and 1968, 13 patients were operated with cardiopulmonary bypass during their pregnancy,
and no patient or fetus was lost. This was the subject of several congress presentations
and a doctoral dissertation at the University of Brazil.</p><p>The Silvestre Hospital became a center of attraction thanks to the cardiac surgery
achievements of Domingos Junqueira de Moraes. It was a hospital visited by surgeons from
all over Brazil, who came in search of knowledge and training. Domingos was a mentor for
a large number of surgeons who currently occupy leading positions in various states of
our country.</p><p>In the 1970's, having brought a disposable Bentley oxygenator from the USA, he began to
manufacture and market a similar device in Brazil. Domingos, in Rio de Janeiro, along
with Adib Jatene, in S&#x000e3;o Paulo, and Domingo Braile, in S&#x000e3;o Jos&#x000e9; do
Rio Preto, were responsible for kick-starting the Brazil's industry of surgical
equipment and products, which made it possible for Brazilian cardiology to compete on an
equal footing with other countries.</p><p>Professor Domingos was always very creative, and in 1997 he published in the Brazilian
Journal of Cardiovascular Surgery (BJCVS) an article<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> with a new concept in the extracorporeal circulation. The
article&#x02019;s title was &#x02018;Use of pure oxygen and venous-arterial shunt in membrane
oxygenators&#x02019;. The hypothesis was to avoid all the venous blood to pass through the
oxygenator, shunting the venous line to the arterial line, avoiding the contact of the
blood with the surface of the oxygenator, and using only oxygen instead of a mixture of
oxygen and air. Surely the amount of blood to be shunted was determined by the oxygen
saturation in the arterial line. This was the normal behavior of Dr. Moraes, permanently
trying to simplify the cardiac surgery.</p><p>Over the course of his career, he participated frequently in surgery, cardiac surgery,
and cardiology congresses, both in Brazil and abroad, presenting works, giving
conferences, and as a member of round tables. He was a Professor at the then Faculdade
Nacional de Medicina da Universidade do Brasil, today UFRJ, a Full Professor of
Cardiovascular Surgery at the Universidade Federal Fluminense, a Full Member, and then
Emeritus, of the Col&#x000e9;gio Brasileiro de Cirurgi&#x000f5;es, a Full Member of the
Sociedade Brasileira de Cirurgia Cardiovascular, a Full Member of the Sociedade
Brasileira de Cardiologia, and a recipient of the Order of Medical Merit.</p><p>Domingos was a surgeon who regarded his profession as a mission, and he knew well his
place in the history of cardiac surgery in Brazil. Outside of the hospital, he was a
kind, talkative, and intelligent man, who was always up to date with things. There was a
certain folklore about his forgetfulness and confusion, but he embraced these anecdotes
and even fed some of the stories. He liked to sit in a bar, have a good beer, and a good
chat.</p><p>For almost five decades, Domingos was married to Alda Coli Junqueira, a descendant of
Italians and daughter of a country doctor. They had four children: Mario Coli Junqueira,
a surgeon like his father, Zuleica Junqueira de Moraes, a cardiologist, M&#x000f4;nica,
and Domingos.</p><p>Domingos retired in 1991 and when he stopped operating, gradually he moved away from the
profession he so loved and to which he dedicated most of his life. Time unmercifully
reduced his hearing, and out of stubbornness, he refused to wear hearing aids. Time also
blurred his vision. With that, he isolated himself from the conversations he enjoyed so
much and remained silent.</p><p>In 2007, he lost his wife, which was a terrible blow for him. Soon after that, he lost
his closest brother, Henrique. For Domingos Junqueira de Moraes, the light went out on
the afternoon of the 30<sup>th</sup> day of last July.</p><p>From now on, he occupies a place in the pantheon reserved for the greats. Today we mourn
Domingos' loss, but we celebrate the almost 100 years he lived among us.</p></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Moraes</surname><given-names>DJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Moraes</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></name><name><surname>Dias</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></name><name><surname>Martins</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Moraes</surname><given-names>ZC</given-names></name><name><surname>Souza</surname><given-names>CG</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Uso de oxig&#x000ea;nio puro e shunt veno-arterial nos

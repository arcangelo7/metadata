In 2017, NHS charges for overseas visitors were extended to include some community care for refused asylum seekers. There is growing concern that this will increase access difficulties, but no recent research has documented the lived experiences of ASR accessing UK primary health care.</p></sec><sec><title>Aim</title><p>To examine ASR experiences accessing primary health care in the UK in 2018.</p></sec><sec><title>Design and setting</title><p>This was a qualitative community-based study. ASR were recruited by criterion-based sampling through voluntary community organisations.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p>A total of 18 ASR completed face-to-face semi-structured recorded interviews discussing primary care access. Transcripts underwent thematic analysis by three researchers using Penchansky and Thomas&#x02019;s modified theory of access.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The qualitative data show that participants found primary care services difficult to navigate and negotiate. Dominant themes included language barriers and inadequate interpretation services; lack of awareness of the structure and function of the NHS; difficulty meeting the costs of dental care, prescription fees, and transport to appointments; and the perception of discrimination relating to race, religion, and immigration status.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>By centralising the voices of ASR and illustrating the negative consequences of poor healthcare access, this article urges consideration of how access to primary care in the UK can be enhanced for often marginalised individuals with complex needs.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>access to health care</kwd><kwd>asylum seekers</kwd><kwd>qualitative research</kwd><kwd>refugees</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Migrants use emergency health services more, and for lower acuity conditions, than non-migrants across Europe.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> It has been speculated that this is due to barriers accessing primary care.

Professionally accredited interpreters were required to sign a confidentiality clause. The nature of the sample meant that many of the participants had experienced traumatic events; therefore, avoiding distress and re-traumatisation were prioritised. The interviewer had &#x0003e;10 years&#x02019; experience working with ASR, and gave participants time and the option to withdraw if signs of distress were shown. The data collected were anonymised. Pseudonyms are used in this paper. No identifiable information was collected, and data were stored on password-protected devices.

The six domains were analysed in turn, and subthemes were identified from the coded data. Often, these subthemes traversed multiple main codes; this complexity is addressed in the discussion.

Many were unclear which provider to access for which service:

<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;I have felt very respected and valued. The doctors have been really respecting us.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Sadia)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>A minority described negative experiences. One participant perceived their GP to be asking inappropriate questions:
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;I felt &#x02026; like he needed to finish because he had a meeting. I didn&#x02019;t feel he cared about what I said, but he just needed to ask &#x02026; to write. I told him what happened to me</italic> [torture]<italic>, and he asked me a question. I don&#x02019;t understand why he asked. He said: &#x0201c;Why, if this is in 2013, you are coming now?&#x0201d; This is feeling so bad for me. I think this is not his issue to ask me why. He&#x02019;s not supposed to ask me this question.&#x02019;</italic></p><attrib>(Mustafa)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>Several participants reported experiencing discrimination from staff at the surgery owing to their race, religion, or immigration status:
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;Especially the staff in the reception, the staff working in GP reception, some of them real</italic> [<italic>sic</italic>] <italic>racist. I saw more than three times, and always one girl &#x02026; she really, really racist. I don&#x02019;t know how to explain that, but her body language is racist &#x02026; turned her face other side.</italic> [She] <italic>shouldn&#x02019;t be racist or make something, because GP for all people. If you want to be racist, be racist in your home or away, not in your job.&#x02019;</italic></p><attrib>(Abu)</attrib></disp-quote>
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;I wear a hijab &#x02026; but some of them, receptionists, there was that white lady, she was so racist. I was in the queue, it was my turn, but the next lady &#x02026; there was a girl behind me; she called her first rather than me, even though I was next. I even told her: &#x0201c;I&#x02019;m next. I&#x02019;ve been waiting here.&#x0201d; It&#x02019;s just, it made me feel like, that just because I&#x02019;m wearing a hijab, just because of my religion, she acted, like, differently with me.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Sadia)</attrib></disp-quote>
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;So, when the receptionist is asking, &#x0201c;are you British, asylum, refugee?&#x0201d; there are people at the back. I might want to keep it confidential, and I don&#x02019;t want to tell other people. They ask in front of everyone, so you&#x02019;re embarrassed to tell them: &#x0201c;Yeah, I am.&#x0201d; They just shout, like: &#x0201c;Okay, what&#x02019;s your status?&#x0201d;&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Laila)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>These excerpts focus on multiple facets, but are united by the description of discrimination. There appears to be a cavalier attitude to confidentiality in some instances.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Summary</title><p>This qualitative study shows that ASR face multiple barriers when accessing primary health care. A lack of awareness of the structure and function of NHS services made the healthcare system difficult to navigate and negotiate. Language barriers and inadequate interpretation in primary care creates both immediate and long-term barriers to accessing care. Discrimination at GP surgeries relating to race, religion, and immigration status was reported. These factors intersect with the difficulties of the asylum system and the multifaceted social marginalisation experienced by ASR in the UK to compound the barriers to accessing health care.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Participants were known to ASR support organisations, thus the sample cannot be considered representative of all ASR and refused asylum seekers. Moreover, those selecting to take part may be more open or eloquent, or have more germane experiences of healthcare systems. ASR not accessing support organisations may be more marginalised, and thus face greater issues with access.<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Language presented some difficulty; despite using trained interpreters, communication was occasionally challenging during the interviews.</p><p>The use of Penchansky and Thomas&#x02019;s modified theoretical framework facilitated a systematic and rigorous analysis of the data. The structure of the theory enhances the replicability of the study, and draws attention to findings that may otherwise have been overlooked. However, at times the theory was not a natural fit, as some subthemes traversed multiple themes. One example is language and interpretation. Although this has been discussed in reference to accommodation, it also impairs access through availability (as the presence of an interpreter effectively shortens consultation time), awareness (as language impairs communication to gain knowledge about services), acceptability (as those with language difficulties face greater discrimination), and affordability (as non-English speakers are less likely to negotiate exemption forms in a timely manner). As a result, the subthemes were not easily compartmentalised; instead, the analysis resulted in an interconnecting web. This brings to the fore the complex and intersecting socioeconomic barriers faced by this population. In light of this, further academic exploration using intersectionality as a theoretical approach may be warranted.<xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with existing literature</title><p>Though this research parallels existing findings showing that ASR face multiple barriers when accessing health care, the data also reveal novel findings. Interestingly, a recent systematic review exploring healthcare professionals&#x02019; experiences of providing care for ASR<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> mirrors the findings in this study of service users. A lack of awareness of the structure and function of NHS services emerged as a dominant theme. Participants told of confusion between GP, dental, and emergency medical provision, and described not knowing that making appointments to see clinicians was a necessary step, and calling 999 for non-urgent medical advice. In some cases, this lack of awareness resulted in a mismatch between expectation and reality, and influenced participants&#x02019; perceptions of what was acceptable care. The extent to which lack of awareness features in the data suggests it requires further academic exploration, as well as raising questions about who is responsible for educating new arrivals to the UK about accessing the NHS.</p><p>Language barriers and inadequate interpretation in primary care have long been identified,<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and are echoed here. Participants&#x02019; experiences illustrate the consequences of failing to provide interpretation services, thus attention is drawn to the fundamental importance of effective communication in consultations. Moreover, the pervasive yet nuanced effects of this have been highlighted, including the burden this places on family members, and its impact on patients&#x02019; self-esteem.</p><p>Participants reported discrimination at GP surgeries relating to their race, religion, and immigration status. Racism has been shown to impair access to health care.<xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Though institutional racism in the NHS, and concern over the stigma posed by the status of refugee, have been reported in other studies, the authors are unaware of literature directly documenting accounts of discrimination towards patients within UK primary care.<xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="b45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> In the current political climate, with hate crime rising, these accounts of racism and Islamophobia are of concern and warrant further exploration.<xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></p><p>It is important to acknowledge the diversity of the study sample and the complexity of the data. Participants had a range of cultural backgrounds, migration trajectories, and health needs. This complexity intersected with the difficulties of the asylum system and the multifaceted social marginalisation experienced by ASR in the UK. For example, the weekly allowance of &#x000a3;37.75 positions ASR in poverty, often unable to buy essential items, including food.<xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Despite primary health care being free, participants&#x02019; accounts demonstrate how poverty can act as a secondary barrier to access. Travel by public transport to appointments is unfeasible due to cost, prolonged waiting for certificates to prove eligibility for free prescriptions left some unable to access medications, and, even with proof of eligibility, dental treatment remained unaffordable. The participants interviewed occupy intersecting positions of social, political, and economic disadvantage, and thus have multiple complex needs that cut across all domains of Penchansky and Thomas&#x02019;s modified theory.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Implications for research and practice</title><p>The results have drawn attention to the fundamental importance of good basic primary care and the human cost of poor access. Examples of poor practice in all domains of access have been highlighted. In some cases, this contravenes existing guidance. NHS England states that individuals are not required to declare their immigration status on registering with a GP.<xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> The BMA advises that practice staff should not attempt to interpret patients&#x02019; immigration status.<xref rid="b49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> Doctors of the World has developed a &#x02018;safe surgeries toolkit&#x02019; to help practices facilitate access to primary care services.<xref rid="b50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> Issues warranting further analysis have been identified, including a closer examination of discrimination towards patients in primary care, and deeper exploration of awareness in both ASR patients and healthcare professionals. Additionally, this research supports Saurman&#x02019;s notion that the dimension of awareness should be included in theoretical thinking on access, particularly when researching marginalised populations whose literacy of mainstream systems may be limited.<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>It is crucial to highlight examples of good practice in primary care. Many participants reported positive experiences of medical consultations, though they often stated longer appointments were needed to address biopsychosocial complexity. Providing accessible patient-centred care for marginalised populations benefits both patients and the care system long-term, including through the reduction of unscheduled care. The empirical findings have implications for clinical practice. First, provision of good interpretation can have far-reaching biopsychosocial benefits. Second, longer appointment times for those with complex needs establishes an effective therapeutic relationship. Third, recognition of the lack of knowledge some ASR have of the structure and function of the NHS can tackle consequent difficulties for access. Finally, the authors call for action against discrimination from healthcare staff towards patients in primary care. This is a pertinent and timely issue, given the instrumentalisation of the NHS in the government&#x02019;s current hostile environment policies, and the rise in hate crimes and Islamophobia in the UK.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the participants for taking part in this research, and the individuals at the voluntary and community organisations for their facilitation of the interviews.</p></ack><notes><sec><title>Funding</title><p>The research was supported through student projects at the University of Manchester.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical approval</title><p>Ethical approval was granted by the University of Manchester Ethics Committee 2 (Ref: 2018-3672-5602).</p></sec><sec><title>Provenance</title><p>Freely submitted; externally peer reviewed.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors have declared no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Discuss this article</title><p>Contribute and read comments about this article: <bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="bjgp.org/letters">bjgp.org/letters</ext-link></bold></p></sec></notes><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="b1"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cred&#x000e9;</surname><given-names>SH</given-names></name><name><surname>Such</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Mason</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>International migrants&#x02019; use of emergency departments in Europe compared with non-migrants&#x02019; use: a systematic review</article-title><source>Eur J Public Health</source><year>2018</year><volume>28</volume><issue>1</issue><fpage>61</fpage><lpage>73</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2"><label>2.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Schouler-Ocak</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Wintrob</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Moussaoui</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Background paper on the needs of migrant, refugee, and asylum seeker patients around the globe</article-title><source>Int J Cult Ment Health</source><year>2016</year><volume>9</volume><issue>3</issue><fpage>216</fpage><lpage>232</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="b3"><label>3.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Strong</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Varady</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Chahda</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Health status and health needs of older refugees from Syria in Lebanon.</article-title><source>Confl Health</source><year>2015</year><volume>9</volume><issue>1</issue><fpage>12</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">26056531</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b4"><label>4.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>MF</given-names></name><name><surname>Telfer</surname><given-names>BL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The health needs of asylum seekers living in the community.</article-title><source>Med J Aust</source><year>2007</year><volume>175</volume><issue>11&#x02013;12</issue><fpage>589</fpage><lpage>592</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="b5"><label>5.</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>British Medical Association.</collab></person-group><source>Asylum seekers&#x02019; healthcare needs.

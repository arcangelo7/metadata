According to annual surveys funded by ECDC and WHO, 34&#x000a0;000 (over 75%) of these deaths in Europe are of people aged 65 years or above, and vaccine uptake remains low in this group.</p><p>Several countries including France and Germany have seen a rapid increase in severe cases of influenza during the 2017&#x02013;18 influenza season in western Europe. According to EuroMOMO, the European organization for monitoring excess mortality for public health action, some of these countries are reporting excess mortality among the elderly.</p><p>Influenza vaccination is generally recommended for people with chronic illnesses, but coverage for this group was below 40% in most countries that reported on this indicator. Almost all countries recommend influenza vaccination for health-care workers, but most of them reported vaccine uptake in this group to be less than 40%.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bit.ly/2C4jo6a">http://bit.ly/2C4jo6a</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>Funds for crisis in Yemen</title><p>The United Nations (UN) has released US$ 9.1 million to WHO to provide urgent health assistance to 630 000 vulnerable people in districts around Sana&#x02019;a and al-Hudayda in Yemen, including 189 000 internally displaced persons and 441 000 people from host communities.</p><p>The funds were released from the new UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) grant on 2 February.</p><p>&#x0201c;WHO is working with partners to fill critical gaps in the provision of basic health care, to respond to disease outbreaks, to strengthen disease surveillance, to distribute medical supplies and to deliver life-saving services to mothers and their children,&#x0201d; said Dr Nevio Zagaria, the WHO Representative in Yemen.</p><p>Only 50% of Yemen&#x02019;s health facilities are fully functional and some 16.4 million people in the conflict-torn country require assistance to ensure adequate access to health care with 9.3 million of them in acute need, he said.</p><p>As lead of the Health Cluster that coordinates the emergency health response in Yemen, WHO is working with 49 partners to deliver health services to 12.3 million people in need.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bit.ly/2EqMDoJ">http://bit.ly/2EqMDoJ</ext-link></p><boxed-text id="Bb" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Cover photo</title></caption><p>A woman washes clothes in a newly constructed water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facility that is supported by the United Nations Children&#x02019;s Fund (UNICEF) in the Bo District of Sierra Leone.

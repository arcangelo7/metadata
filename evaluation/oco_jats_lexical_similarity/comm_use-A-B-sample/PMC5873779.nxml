thrombus formation, but it can have deleterious effects on surgical
hemostasis. Anaemia, if present, gives additional risk to such patients. The

where DAPT was discontinued for more than 5 days prior to CABG (n=57). All

57% of total mortality. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is one of the most dramatic
subtypes of ischemic heart disease and represents an important challenge. Dual
antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), mostly with acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel (P2Y12
receptor inhibitor), has become the basis of ACS therapy. Indeed, it is well
established that DAPT in ACS significantly decreases the incidence of new thrombotic
and ischemic events<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>ACS patients rarely demand coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). However, up to 10%
of these patients may present with clinical findings requiring urgent or emergent
coronary surgery<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.
Noteworthy these patients constitute a surgical challenge due to the fact that
majority of them received DAPT prior to coronary angiography, as well as taking into
account their inherent hemodynamic instability and potential unknown or unrecognized
comorbidity<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. Furthermore, there is an
elevated surgical risk due to the deleterious effects of DAPT on hemostasis during
and after CABG<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Before CABG one must take into account the deterioration of platelet function by the
preoperative DAPT usage, as well as the impairment of platelet function due to
cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) <italic>per se.</italic> Up to date, the management of
preoperative antiplatelet therapy in CABG differs considerably among surgeons. In
this respect, there is conflict between guidelines and prejudices regarding the
preoperative aspirin usage. Indeed, in one hand, published data suggest that aspirin
treatment should be held for 7-10 days preoperatively in patients undergoing
elective CABG<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>,
whereas more recent reports indicate that patients with coronary artery disease
referred to CABG should continue aspirin treatment until the surgical
procedure<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. Likewise, clopidogrel usage was established to improve
outcome after ACS by reducing early stent failure and diminishing allcause mortality
and cardiovascular mortality<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>However, numerous studies have shown that CABG performed within 5 days of clopidogrel
administration is associated with increased postoperative bleeding, reoperation for
bleeding and prolonged hospital stay. Indeed, current guidelines recommend to
postpone CABG if possible for 5 or more days after clopidogrel
withdrawal<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. On the other hand, withdrawing all DAPT for more than
5 days before surgery can increase the risk of fatal and non-fatal ischemic events,
as well as increasing the mortality of patients with ACS<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>. Indeed, although
mediastinal bleeding after CABG is not uncommon, it has an important influence on
mortality and morbidity<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Sabatine et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>
showed that preoperative anemia, if present, is an independent predictor of major
adverse cardiovascular events in patients with ACS. In patients with ACS without ST
elevation, the risk for cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or recurrent
ischemia increases if hemoglobin levels are below 110 g/L. It is the same in
patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction, but when hemoglobin levels fall
below 140 g/L<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Low hemoglobin level is a strong predictor for postoperative need for transfusion,
especially in CABG patients operated using extracorporeal
circulation<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The aim of this study was to examine if DAPT affects postoperative bleeding in
patients with haemoglobin levels above 110 g/L, who underwent urgent or emergent
CABG, less than five days after stopping DAPT therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>From March 2008 to June 2012, 122 patients with ACS underwent CABG using CPB, in the
first 10 days after the coronary catheterization, by the same surgical team at the
Institute for Cardiovascular diseases in Sremska Kamenica (Novi Sad). All patients
received DAPT before coronary catheterization. All surgeries were described as
urgent or emergent. Exclusion criteria were elective patients, combined procedures,
reoperations, offpump revascularizations and preoperative anemia (hemoglobin levels
less than 110 g/L). The following data were recorded: standard demographics,
comorbidity and routine intraoperative and postoperative parameters, including blood
loss and transfusion requirements in the first 48 hours postoperatively. The primary
outcome was blood loss in the first 48 hours along with transfusion requirements,
and the need for reoperation for bleeding. The secondary outcome was in-hospital
mortality and hospital length of stay.</p><p>The patients were classified into two groups: 65 patients operated within 4 days
(group 1), and specifically (day 0, 26 patients; day 1, 18 patients; day 2, 10
patients; day 3, 10 patients; day 4, 1 patient), whereas 57 patients operated from
5<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> day after clopidogrel discontinuation (group
2).</p><p>All operations were performed in normothermia, using CPB. The standard circuit was
primed with a crystalloid solution. We were using roller pump in all patients.
Standard heparinization protocol was applied (300 U/kg). Tranexamic acid was given
to all patients in dosage of 30 mg/kg. Cold crystalloid cardioplegia (10-15 mL/kg)
was used for myocardial protection. After weaning from CPB, heparin was neutralized
with protamine sulfate (1 mg/100 U heparin).</p><p>The clinical criterion for platelet and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusion was
excessive bleeding despite the fact that the activated clotting time (ACT) value was
normal and that there was no recognized surgical bleeding. The criteria for
erythrocyte transfusion were a fall in hemoglobin below 90 g/L. The indication for
re-exploration was bleeding over 400 mL during the first hour, 300 mL for 2-3 hours,
or more than 200 mL/h during the next four hours despite the normal value of ACT.
The late re-exploration was indicated when there was an echocardiographically proven
pericardial effusion greater than 1.5 cm, or cardiac tamponade.</p><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 17.0 statistical software.
Continuous variables were evaluated using analysis of variance (ANOVA);
categorical variables were evaluated using &#x003c7;2 analysis or Fisher's exact
test. Multivariable models were created using logistic regression techniques for
dichotomous outcomes and linear regression techniques for continuous
outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Baseline characteristics of all patients are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>. There were no statistically significant differences in

postoperative blood loss and increased surgical complications and mortality. The
etiology of excessive postoperative blood loss is multifactorial, including small
body size, female gender and concomitant procedures<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>. In many patients with ACS, DAPT is not the only therapy
that can influence surgical bleeding. Preoperative anticoagulants can affect
hemostasis to a greater extent, and can be an important factor in the etiology of
excessive blood loss. Moreover, about 3% of all CABG patients require reoperation
for bleeding, which is followed by significant morbidity and
mortality<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. Under these circumstances,
disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, hemodynamic instability and death are not
uncommon. Furthermore, excessive blood loss is associated with increased blood and
platelet transfusions, as well as administration of coagulation factors.</p><p>Anemia, if present, increases the need for postoperative transfusions. Anemia is also
associated with increased mortality and postoperative morbidity in CABG
patients<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>. That is the reason why we
excluded patients with preoperative hemoglobin levels below 110 g/L in our
study.</p><p>The results of the present study show that the use of clopidogrel within 5 days of
CABG (in non-anemic patients) was not associated with increased postoperative blood
losses, as well as with an increased number of re-explorations for postoperative
bleeding. The preoperative use of clopidogrel, however, was associated with an
increased number of RBC and platelet transfusions.</p><p>Over the last years, different clinical studies on DAPT in ACS have shown conflicting
results. Differences in these findings and conclusions can be explained by
variations in surgical indications, presence of comorbidity, differences in
cardiological, anesthesiologic and surgical skills, as well as differences in
preoperative therapy. Indeed, many studies have shown that clopidogrel
administration prior to surgical revascularization is followed by increased
incidence of postoperative bleeding, transfusion requirements and re-explorations
with prolonged hospital stay<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Berger et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>
compared two groups of patients in relatively large retrospective study. In the
group of patients who received clopidogrel in less than 5 days prior to CABG, there
was an increased incidence of bleeding, re-explorations and increased hospital stay.
On the other hand, this group of patients had significantly increased incidence of
preoperative myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accidents, previous
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures and more urgent surgical
revascularizations. There were no differences in mortality and major adverse cardiac
and cerebrovascular events (MACCE)<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>. Furthermore, Yende et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> reported increased
re-exploration rate in patients with DAPT within 5 days of surgical
revascularization. The study by Hongo et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> demonstrated increased 24-hour chest tube
drainage, transfusion requirements, and reoperation rate for bleeding of patients on
clopidogrel within 7 days of operation. In summary, the authors of both studies were
against routine DAPT administration before PCI because of the increased morbidity
risk if emergent CABG was mandatory. In a small series of 55 patients receiving
clopidogrel preoperatively, significantly increased blood losses and transfusion
requirements were reported<sup>[<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>. A subgroup analysis of the Clopidogrel in Unstable
angina to prevent Recurrent Events trial (CURE) trial identified 912 patients who
had discontinued clopidogrel within 5 days of CABG In this group of patients, there
was an increased risk of minor bleeding complications and a trend towards an
increased risk of major bleeding complications, defined as substantially disabling
bleeding or requiring more than 2 units of packed RBC transfusion, was
shown<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>. On the other hand, in a
recent study by Chen et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup>, preoperative clopidogrel exposure was not associated
with increased RBC transfusion. Furthermore, there are some studies that underline
the influence of both surgical and institutional experience on the
results<sup>[<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In our study, only one surgical team (same surgeon and anesthesiologist) operated all
patients enrolled in a specialized institution. There were no elective patients, and
the decision of a surgical timing was made according to the clinical status of the
patient. When considering mortality and morbidity of patients enrolled, we can see
that there was no mortality in both groups of patients, but that patients in group 2
had a longer postoperative hospital stay compared to patients in group 1. However,
these observations were restricted to in-hospital mortality and 30-day
mortality.</p><p>According to current guidelines, it is suggested to optimally refrain from using
clopidogrel within at least 5 days prior to elective surgery to minimize the risks
of postoperative coagulopathy; that the emergent patients should proceed immediately
to surgery, while semi-urgent patients should be treated on a case-by-case
basis<sup>[<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>-<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The cardiologist, anesthesiologist and the surgeon must balance the risk of further
ischemic events against the risk of postoperative bleeding and, according to our
institutional policy, we operate all unstable patients and wait for 5 or more days
in patients who can be medically stabilized.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Urgent and emergent surgical revascularization using CPB in patients with ACS who
were on DAPT preoperatively (withdrawal period 1-4 days), whose hemoglobin level is
not less than 110 g/L, is a safe and effective procedure. The results of the present
study showed that preoperative use of clopidogrel did not increase the risk of
postoperative bleeding and did not affect the in-hospital and 30-day mortality.
Further prospective randomized studies in a larger number of patients with a longer
follow-up are needed to draw a conclusion that would benefit this important and
special subgroup of patients.</p><p>It should be noted that the particularity of the targeted patient group, in addition
to the ongoing recommendations, requires an integrated patient-to-patient approach
to determine <italic>pro et contra</italic> of early or emergent surgery despite an
alleviated risk of bleeding and complications.</p><table-wrap id="t5" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="5%" span="1"/><col width="95%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SMK</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Agreement to be accountable for all

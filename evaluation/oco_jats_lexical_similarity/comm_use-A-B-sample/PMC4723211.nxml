Organisational changes to the NHS have led to an increase in administrative tasks and overall workload that is perceived by GP participants to have fundamentally changed the doctor&#x02013;patient relationship. Lack of time with patients has compromised the ability to practise more patient-centred care, and, with it, GPs&#x02019; sense of professional autonomy and values, resulting in diminished job satisfaction. In this context, the additional pressures of increased patient demand and the negative media portrayal left many feeling unsupported and vulnerable to burnout and ill health, and, ultimately, to the decision to leave general practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>To improve retention of young GPs, the pace of administrative change needs to be minimised and the time spent by GPs on work that is not face-to-face patient care reduced.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>burnout</kwd><kwd>general practice</kwd><kwd>job satisfaction</kwd><kwd>professional autonomy</kwd><kwd>qualitative research</kwd><kwd>workload</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>It has been the policy of successive UK governments to address the challenge of the growing healthcare needs of the ageing population by transferring care into the community setting.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In the 10 years prior to 2011, the GP workforce in the UK had an annual average increase of 2.3%.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> However, this was only half the rate of other medical specialties.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Patient demand for GP services in England continues to grow, with an estimated 340 million patient consultations per year, an increase of 40 million since 2008.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The UK Department of Health (DH) has set a target that half of all medical graduates entering postgraduate specialty training should go into GP training.<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> However, despite the longstanding DH policy to increase GP training numbers in England to 3250 per annum, GP recruitment has remained below this target, at around 2700 per annum.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The cost of 5 years&#x02019; foundation and GP training programmes is &#x000a3;249 261 per GP.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> It is therefore imperative that these highly trained professionals are retained within the UK primary care workforce.</p><p>In the 5 years between 2009 and 2014, 45.5% of England&#x02019;s 12 690 GP leavers were aged &#x0003c;50 years, while 30.6% were aged 50&#x02013;59 years, and less than one-quarter were aged &#x02265;60 years.<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> This early loss of GPs is contributing to the GP workforce crisis.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In 2013, Health Education England and NHS England commissioned this mixed methods study to investigate why so many GPs leave the NHS below the age of 50 years.<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> This article summarises the main reasons for leaving.</p></sec><sec><title>METHOD</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design</title><p>A mixed methods study comprising an online survey, triangulated with qualitative interviews, was conducted.

Key drivers for leaving early relate to changes in the NHS, resulting in loss of professional autonomy, and in overwork, stress, and burnout. General practice in the UK has undergone a series of organisational changes culminating in an increase in day-to-day administrative tasks, which have come to adversely impact the doctor&#x02013;patient relationship. To improve retention of young GPs in practice, time spent on work that is not face-to-face patient care needs to be minimised.</p></sec></boxed-text></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Analysis</title><sec><title>Quantitative</title><p>Survey data were analysed using descriptive statistics.

Team members each coded three transcripts, before comparing their analyses for inconsistencies and agreement.

Their median age range was 40&#x02013;44 years. Forty-six (32.2%) stated that they still work as GPs but outside the EU, seven (4.9%) work as GPs in another part of the EU, and two (1.4%) in another part of the UK (not England). Nineteen (13.3%) do other clinical work, and 22 (15.4%) do non-clinical medical work. Thirteen (9.1%) said that they were full-time parents, and 14 (9.8%) were carers. A further nine (6.3%) had retired voluntarily, and six (4.2%) had retired on medical grounds. The remainder were in non-medical careers.</p><p>Of the 21 interviewees, 14 participants were female and seven were male, with an age range of 32&#x02013;54 years at the time of interview. They had been practising GPs in England for between 2.5 and 20 years; their ages when they left general practice in England ranged from 29&#x02013;50 years. Interviewees represented a maximum variation sample in terms of age, number of years as practising GPs, and geographical location.</p><p>At interview, five participants were working as GPs abroad; five had either retired early on medical grounds or taken jobs that accommodated their illness; eight worked in related fields, such as medical education, the tribunal service, managerial roles, and public health; two decided to focus on raising their families; one worked in a non-medical career.</p><p>Although many of the categories in the survey were also identified in the analysis of the qualitative interviews, the inductive and interpretative nature of the qualitative analysis generated a thematic summary that illustrates the complex and overlapping issues causing GPs to leave practice early (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The qualitative findings are therefore given primacy here and are supported by relevant statistical evidence from the survey.<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>All survey responders indicated that they had left English general practice for multiple reasons:

This is discussed in relation to the sub-themes: organisational changes; clash of values; increased workload; negative media portrayal; workplace issues; and lack of support.</p><sec><title>Organisational changes</title><p>Participants described a radically altered working environment caused by an unprecedented increase in organisational changes, many of which were felt to be made without any <italic>&#x02018;long-term vision&#x02019;</italic> (GP19), and for <italic>&#x02018;little health gain&#x02019;</italic> (GP15). Unhappiness with day-to-day life as a GP was indicated by 78.9% of survey responders, in particular, changes to the role of the GP (43.7%):
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;Cases were getting more complicated, more was being transferred from the responsibility of the hospital to the responsibility of GPs</italic> [&#x02026;]<italic>, I was spending more and more time doing administrative things and less and less time being able to devote my mental attention to the patients in front of me. I just felt more and more stretched.&#x02019;</italic></p><attrib>(GP3)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>As referral systems became more complex and hospitals more specialised, interviewees experienced a more fragmented and depersonalised healthcare system that was increasingly challenging for them to navigate:
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;One of the problems with hospital medicine is it&#x02019;s very fragmented</italic> [&#x02026;]<italic>, so if you sent somebody in with one thing, they have that sorted, but they don&#x02019;t look at the bigger picture, so they&#x02019;d come back out and there&#x02019;d be another thing that was developing so you&#x02019;d have to refer them to somewhere else, so the fragmented nature of hospital medicine makes general practice quite difficult.&#x02019;</italic></p><attrib>(GP4)</attrib></disp-quote></p></sec><sec><title>Clash of values</title><p>According to participants, continual organisational changes fundamentally altered their professional role to a &#x02018;government clerk&#x02019; or a <italic>&#x02018;data clerk for public health and for management&#x02019;</italic> (GP15). The increasing influx of administrative tasks left many feeling professionally compromised as they came to face conflicting priorities in the consulting room. Among survey responders, 55.6% stated that the goalposts were being moved too often and 52.1% disliked the &#x02018;target-driven&#x02019; approach to patient care:

Fifty per cent of survey responders thought that having too high a non-clinical workload was a factor in their decision to leave practice early, while 83.8% said that aspects relating to pressure of work featured in their decision:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;The consultation&#x02019;s length didn&#x02019;t change, but what you were expected to do in a consultation changed.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(GP11)</attrib></disp-quote></p><disp-quote><p>&#x02018;I felt I was cutting corners, I felt I wasn&#x02019;t offering a good service unfortunately.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(GP6)</attrib></disp-quote><p>The higher administrative workload reduced the time available to spend with their patients, leading to a fundamental change in the doctor&#x02013;patient relationship:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;You see it does change the doctor&#x02013;patient relationship because it changes how you react to people and how you interact with people. I mean it&#x02019;s obvious stuff, but when you&#x02019;re really stressed and you&#x02019;ve still got 15 people to see, you don&#x02019;t have the time for people, you don&#x02019;t have the interest.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(GP11)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>The conditions within which doctors were expected to function affected their ability to practise holistic, patient-centred care:
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;Patients are dissatisfied</italic> [&#x02026;] <italic>because they&#x02019;re not being given sufficient time to give their history properly and be investigated at the primary care level</italic> [&#x02026;] <italic>there isn&#x02019;t that reflective quality that allows differential diagnosis, use of time, the use of your personal knowledge of the individual and their social circumstances to be applied.&#x02019;</italic></p><attrib>(GP9)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>With more work shifting from hospital to primary care, combined with changes in patient population and demand, participants felt increasingly time-stretched. Strategies to cope included staying late at work, taking work home, or changing their appointment times:
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;I changed my work patterns because I kept getting migraine headaches, because I was getting stressed because of time pressures</italic> [&#x02026;] <italic>I found it very stressful, having patients just waiting, because I was running late on a regular basis.&#x02019;</italic></p><attrib>(GP2)</attrib></disp-quote></p></sec><sec><title>Negative media portrayal</title><p>Factors relating to patients and the media were cited by 63.4% of survey responders. Concerns about media attacks on the medical profession were indicated more frequently (57.0%) than fear of litigation (25.4%) or complaints (17.6%).</p><p>Rather than feeling supported in their efforts to meet patient demands, or to cope with the pressures inherent in a high-risk working environment, participants instead felt worn down by negative media representations:

<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;One of the frustrations is that I think there was definitely a political spin against general practice</italic> [&#x02026;] <italic>It doesn&#x02019;t help when you&#x02019;ve had a bad day at work and you come home and watch the 10 o&#x02019;clock news and you see somebody on the telly saying &#x0201c;Oh these GPs aren&#x02019;t working very hard and patients can never get appointments&#x0201d;</italic> [&#x02026;] <italic>Just constant criticism in the press about the fact that GPs were getting paid an awful lot of money and they weren&#x02019;t having to do the out-of-hours and they weren&#x02019;t working nights and weekends.&#x02019;</italic></p><attrib>(GP6)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>Not only did participants feel misrepresented by &#x02018;political spin&#x02019;, but they also felt frustrated that the more positive aspects of their hard work and professionalism went largely unreported:

These issues within practices were exacerbated by the lack of time for more informal interactions and support among colleagues. Although all participants felt supported during their training and registrar years, once fully qualified they became increasingly isolated in practice:
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;I did sometimes feel quite isolated at the practice</italic> [&#x02026;] <italic>I think the thing that possibly my training hadn&#x02019;t prepared me for was sort of feeling like a lone worker in many ways, particularly in comparison to working in a hospital where you were always part of a team.&#x02019;</italic></p><attrib>(GP3)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>Participants expressed the view that more was being expected of them by government, without the necessary support in place:

<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;There is a really aggressive, vicious, bullying culture that permeates management in the NHS. That then flows all the way down to whoever your locality middle managers are. It&#x02019;s a dreadful, awful, bullying culture and to shift from that to a non-overseeing, facilitative, hands-off, trusting culture is ... I don&#x02019;t know if people are capable of that cultural shift.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(GP15)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>In light of this reported culture of bullying, several interviewees expressed the need for more support, particularly in the form of a more &#x02018;robust&#x02019; occupational health service for doctors.

These pressures, intensified by a perceived <italic>&#x02018;blame culture&#x02019;</italic>, led to disillusionment and a raised anxiety about the risk of making a mistake:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;I found that I was increasingly anxious about the patients that I was seeing. I think because I was so often quite time-strapped with all the things that I was trying to fit in during the day.

These included organisational changes resulting in a clash of values and diminishing professional autonomy as health care became more centralised, standardised, and depersonalised; an unprecedented increase in administrative workload; and a lack of support not only from government, but also across services and the wider community due to an ongoing negative media campaign.</p><p>This combination of factors led to reduced job satisfaction and ultimately affected wellbeing. In some cases, participants grew to hate their job:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;I think I got to the point where I hated it and, that&#x02019;s a really strong word.

<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;I don&#x02019;t think I was medically ill, but I was certainly quite grumpy and I was quite fed up and I just wasn&#x02019;t enjoying work and I got to the stage when I was driving to work and I used to have this sort of sense of dread the nearer I got to the practice and I thought &#x0201c;Oh no, another day is coming&#x0201d;. I thought this isn&#x02019;t right, I shouldn&#x02019;t be feeling like this!&#x02019;</p><attrib>(GP6)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>Others decided to act upon these early-warning signs and leave:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;Before getting to the point where I really thought I was going to burn out and really hit a very low point mentally and psychologically, I thought actually, I think I recognised those warning signs and I thought it better to go do something different at this point while I still have the wherewithal to go and do it.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(GP12)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>Personal factors were cited by 90.8% of survey responders, in particular, feeling overworked (53.5%), a wish to improve their work&#x02013;life balance (49.3%), the work being too stressful (43.0%), and lack of enjoyment of the work (41.5%).</p><p>Overall, participants felt that their job was not meeting expectations, particularly among GPs who had been in practice for &#x02265;10 years, it was felt that their current job was unrecognisable from the professional role they had initially taken on.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Summary</title><p>Participants had been attracted to GP work in the expectation that it would offer continuity of patient care, professional autonomy, and flexibility in working hours, along with the intellectual challenges inherent in problem solving. However, participants described factors that were both cumulative and multifactorial, leading to their decision to leave practice early in their careers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>The extent and rapidity of organisational changes to the NHS, which had led to an increase in day-to-day administrative tasks and overall workload, were perceived by participants to have fundamentally changed the doctor&#x02013;patient relationship: the very hallmark of general practice.</p><p>Lack of time with patients meant the ability to practise patient-centred continuity of care was perceived to be compromised and, with it, the GPs&#x02019; professional autonomy and values, resulting in diminished job satisfaction. Once their job satisfaction had become negatively impacted, the combined pressures of increased patient demand and the negative media portrayal left many feeling unsupported and vulnerable to burnout and ill health, and, ultimately, to the decision to leave general practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>GP training, recruitment, and retention in the UK is fast approaching crisis point as more GPs leave the profession at a younger age. This study triangulates interview findings with survey results to provide an in-depth exploration of the reasons why this is happening. Participants were self-selecting and therefore may have had particularly strong views. However, interviewees represented a maximum variation sample in terms of age, number of years as practising GPs, and geographical location.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with existing literature</title><p>Although current evidence points to an impending crisis in the recruitment and retention of GPs in the UK,<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> this is by no means a new phenomenon,<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> nor one which is unique to the UK workforce.<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> In 2001, a survey carried out by the BMA revealed that one-quarter of GPs wanted to quit,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> while a number of surveys, carried out before and since, have continued to monitor GP training, retention, and recruitment, particularly in relation to contractual reforms, job satisfaction, and burnout.<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Much research has been carried out on factors associated with stress, anxiety, depression, and burnout among doctors in the UK and abroad.<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> There has also been a renewed focus in the research literature upon educational initiatives, preventive measures, and therapeutic interventions that could help combat what is perceived to be a growing malaise within the healthcare profession.<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p><p>In a recent BMA survey, 80% of 1000 responders rated work pressure as &#x02018;high or very high&#x02019;, with their main workplace stresses being &#x02018;meeting patients&#x02019; demands, lack of time, and excessive bureaucracy&#x02019;.<xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> In a study looking at motives for early retirement among GPs in the Netherlands, policies related to workload reduction were considered the most useful instruments to control retention and retirement.<xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> The current mixed methods study complements and extends this literature, by showing the cumulative, inter-related, and multifactorial reasons as to why GPs are leaving practice early in their careers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Implications for research and practice</title><p>The early loss of GPs causes a considerable drain on NHS resources.

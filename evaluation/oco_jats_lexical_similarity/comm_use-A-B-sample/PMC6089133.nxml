urban violence have contributed to a significant rise in the number of heart
injuries by firearm projectiles. Such injuries are associated with the highest
mortality rates among penetrating cardiac injuries and may involve one or more
cardiac chambers. We present the case of a police officer who, in an approach to
five robbers, suffered a transfixed cardiac injury by firearm with the
projectile having been lodged inside the right ventricle. This patient was
successfully operated, 65 days after the injury, at our institution.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Heart injuries</kwd><kwd>Wounds and Injuries</kwd><kwd>Wounds, Gunshot</kwd><kwd>Cardiac Surgical Procedures</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Despite advances in medicine that have high technology to support critical patients,
penetrating cardiac injuries still pose a challenge to cardiothoracic surgery teams
because of the high mortality rates. The high number of deaths in the prehospital
phase impairs the calculation of the real mortality rates, but values are estimated
between 16% to 97%<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. The mechanism of trauma, the clinical conditions at
hospital admission, and the presence of lesions in multiple cardiac chambers are the
most important variables for the determination of the outcome in these
patients<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. The main causes of death are the hypovolemic shock
due to exsanguination, and the cardiac tamponade<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. Currently, heart
injuries have been more common due to the rampant growth of urban violence and the
easy access of the civilian population to firearms<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>CASE REPORT</title><p>LSA, a 34-year-old male police officer, came to the office to report that he had been
discharged 16 days after being treated for chest injury by firearm. He reported that
the projectiles (two) were still in his body. He reported having been treated in the
public hospital emergency room with two projectiles orifices entries in the lateral
side (subaxillary), on the average height of the right hemithorax, provoked during
the approach of robbers in an attempt of assault. According to a copy of the
admission record, he was slightly discolored, peripheral perfusion maintained,
tachycardic, and with decreased vesicular murmur on the right chest. Initial
stabilization support measures were established. Chest X-rays showed one projectile
in anterior cardiac topography, near the apex of the heart and another in the right
rectus abdominis, near the thoracoabdominal transition. In addition, it showed
moderate right pleural effusion. Computed tomography of the chest ratified the
radiographic findings and showed discrete pericardial effusion. The right hemithorax
was drained, and then the patient was transferred to a private hospital, where the
radiographs and tomography of the chest were repeated, besides transthoracic and
transesophageal echocardiograms. None of them report the presence of a projectile
within the heart. All reports referred to the presence of a projectile in topography
around the heart - nearby. During the hospitalization, the patient had a right
pulmonary embolism, and was anticoagulated with rivaroxaban, being discharged after
two weeks. Upon analyzing the case in detail, we could not rule out the possibility
that one of the projectiles was lodged inside the heart. New imaging exams were
requested from the outpatient in another institution. However, the reports remained
imprecise as to the exact location of the projectile in cardiac topography. After a
clinical meeting for discussion of all the exams, a new echocardiogram was elected,
which, this time, showed the projectile inside the right ventricle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). The patient was promptly hospitalized
and underwent surgical intervention. Access to the thoracic cavity was made by
median sternotomy. No hematoma was observed in the pericardial fat, and after the
pericardiotomy, the orifice of entry of the projectile in the pericardial cavity was
not found. Only discrete sero-sanguineous effusion was found. Extracorporeal
circulation was established by drainage of both vena cava and infusion by the
ascending aorta. A tactile inspection of the diaphragmatic wall of the right
ventricle was performed under total aortic clamping and cardioplegic arrest with
Custodiol(r). This maneuver allowed us to feel the presence of the projectile near
the apex of this ventricle. Unbelievably, the diaphragmatic wall of the right
ventricle did not show the projectile's inlet orifice. A ventriculotomy of
approximately 3 cm was performed on the diaphragmatic face of the right ventricle
followed by removal of the projectile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure
2</xref>). Right ventricle closure was performed with separate "U" points (3.0
polypropylene) anchored in two Teflon(r) bars. Extracorporeal circulation was
discontinued as soon as hemodynamic conditions allowed. Through the median incision
the other projectile, which had been lodged in the right rectus abdominis, was
located and removed. Surgery was completed with the revision of hemostasis,
mediastinal drainage, and closure of the thorax. Trans and postoperative
echocardiograms did not show the presence of interventricular communication. The
patient presented a good evolution when he was discharged, thus returning to his
normal healthy life.</p><p>

penetrating cardiac injuries die before their admission to a
hospital<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. Most are caused by white weapons or firearm
projectiles<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>, although such injuries may also be caused by
foreign bodies, costal or sternal fractures<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup><sup>]</sup> under more rare circumstances.
Penetrating cardiac injuries by white weapons are more frequent than firearms, but
the increase in urban violence rates has contributed to the growing importance of
the firearms injuries<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. Degiannis et al.<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>, analyzing 117 patients
with cardiac trauma by white weapons or firearm projectiles, showed that in the
victims of firearm injuries, mortality reached 81%, being statistically significant
when compared to the 15.6% associated with injuries due to white weapons. The same
data were not found by Rodrigues et al.<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>, whom, in an analysis of 70 patients
with penetrating cardiac wounds by white weapons or firearms, found no statistical
differences in mortality between the two groups. As said previously, the high number
of deaths in the prehospital phase impairs the calculation of the real mortality
rates and may justify, at least in part, the observed differences. Degiannis et
al.<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>
also found no differences in mortality rates when comparing wounds in one or
multiple cardiac chambers. Lone et al.<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup><sup>]</sup> studied 40 patients considering only
heart injuries by projectiles of firearms and shrapnel and showed that 87.5% had a
lesion in a single chamber and that in this group survival was 62.8%. The 12.5% with
lesions in more than one chamber presented 100% mortality. The present patient had a
transfixing lesion that affected the right ventricle, with the projectile lodged
inside this cardiac chamber. This occurrence characterizes it as a rare case, given
the mechanism of the trauma, the final location of the projectile and the outcome
presented. After all, it did not evolve either to death due to cardiac injury nor to
the resulting pulmonary embolism. Similar to this report, is Meira et
al.<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>
report case, in which the projectile lodged inside the right ventricle was removed
18 days after the trauma. In this particular case, the projectile was also lodged
inside the right ventricle, but 65 days were elapsed between the lesion and its
removal. Ventricular penetrating lesions tend to bleed less intensely than atrial
ones because they are stagnant during myocardial contractions<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>, a fact that may have
been relevant to the favorable outcome presented here. In this way, another relevant
point may have been the location near the apex of the right ventricle, a trabecular
region, which may have contributed to the containment of the bleeding.</p><table-wrap id="t1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="10%" span="1"/><col width="90%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MAV</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Substantial contributions to the

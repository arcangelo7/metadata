decrease the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and consequently reducing death, and the
relief of anginal symptoms. While in the setting of acute coronary syndrome, the role of
myocardial revascularization is well established, interventional procedures in patients
with stable disease, especially percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), remains
controversial.</p><p>In this context, the recently published ORBITA trial<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup><sup>]</sup> in The Lancet journal, has
brought important responses to this debate, involving unconventional and disruptive
concepts in the field as placebo and nocebo effects. As the first blinded randomized,
placebo-controlled trial to test the efficacy of drug eluting stents
<italic>versus</italic> optimized medical treatment (OMT), the study enrolled 230
patients with stable angina and coronary artery stenosis &#x02265; 70% to receive a sham
<italic>versus</italic> current PCI. During 6 weeks after the false or true
procedure, both groups underwent to OMT, and the endpoints of exercise time, peak O2
consumption and control of angina were compared. Coronary lesions had mean area stenosis
of 84.4%, and fractional flow reserve of 0.69. No significant difference in the primary
endpoint of exercise time increment between groups (PCI minus placebo 16.6 s, 95% CI -
8.9 to 42 - <italic>P</italic>=0.2) was observed and also no deaths reported. Serious
adverse events included four pressure-wire related complications in the placebo group,
and five major bleeding events, including two in the PCI group and three in the placebo
group. Contrary to the concepts derived from previous non-randomized studies, the
authors concluded that in patients with medically treated angina and severe coronary
stenosis, PCI did not increase exercise time by more than the effect of a placebo
procedure.</p><p>These apparently surprising results are supported by an impressive methodological rigor
and careful conduction of the study. The measurement of the placebo effect, with the
creation of the sham group, is an innovation, and the researchers were impeccable in
controlling bias. Another impressive point was the strict clinical control: for 6 weeks,
patients could call a cardiologist 24 hour by 7 days a week, who would evaluate their
medications and make sure they were understanding side effects. And medicines were
adjusted a couple of times a week to get people maximally tolerated antianginal
therapy.</p><p>As the key message, ORBITA delivered that the common clinical observation of symptomatic
improvement from PCI might well contain a large placebo component.</p><p>Previously to the ORBITA trial, the benefits of routine revascularization in stable
ischemic heart disease have been questioned, in terms of death and MI rates, in several
randomized studies: Medicine, Angioplasty or Surgery Study (MASS II), Clinical Outcomes
Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation (COURAGE), Bypass Angioplasty
Revascularization Investigation 2 Diabetes (BARI 2D) and more recently, the ongoing
International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness with Medical and Invasive
Approaches (ISCHEMIA) trial.</p><p>In the MASS II trial<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>, 611 patients with proximal multivessel disease and
documented ischemia were randomly assigned to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG),
PCI, or OMT. The 10-year mortality rates in the 3 groups were 25.1%, 24.9%, and 31.0%,
respectively (<italic>P</italic>=0.09). The 10-year MI rates were 10.3%, 13.3%, and
20.7%, respectively (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01). Freedom from angina at 10 years was
64% with CABG, 59% with PCI, and 43% with OMT (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001).</p><p>In the COURAGE trial<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>, randomization of 2.287 patients to PCI plus OMT
<italic>versus</italic> OMT alone did not reduce the long-term rate of death or MI.
Nor, however, did PCI worsen prognosis, and crossover to PCI for progressive symptoms or
acute coronary syndrome was required in 32% of OMT patients during a median 4.6-year
follow-up. Moreover, patients randomized to PCI had less documented angina, were more
likely to be angina-free (despite requiring fewer nitrates and calciumchannel blockers),
and had improved quality of life for up to 3 years (8.35). The reduction in angina
(assessed by the Seattle Angina Questionnaire) with PCI <italic>versus</italic> OMT was
most evident only in those with the greatest level of baseline angina.</p><p>In the BARI 2D trial<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>, 2.368 patients with type 2 diabetes (90% with stable
ischemic heart disease) were randomized to prompt revascularization with intensive
medical therapy (MT) or to intensive MT alone, with randomization stratified by intended
PCI <italic>versus</italic> CABG. The 5-year rates of death (the primary endpoint) and
major adverse cardiac events (MACE - death, MI, or stroke) were not significantly
different with either strategy. However, patients in the CABG stratum had more advanced
coronary artery disease (including more triple-vessel and proximal left anterior
descending coronary artery disease) than those in the PCI stratum, and patients
randomized to CABG <italic>versus</italic> intensive MT had lower 5-year rates of MACE
(22.4% <italic>vs.</italic> 30.5%; <italic>P</italic>=0.01), driven by less MI (7.4%
<italic>vs.</italic> 14.6%). In patients with less extensive coronary artery
disease, there was no difference in MACE with PCI <italic>versus</italic> intensive MT.
Compared with intensive MT, prompt revascularization resulted in significantly greater
freedom from angina for up to 4 years. Most measures of quality of life through the
4-year follow-up were also improved with routine revascularization compared with
intensive MT only, and revascularization was ultimately required in 42% of MT patients
during follow-up.</p><p>Of note, bare-metal stents (BMS) were used in most PCI <italic>versus</italic> MT trials,
including the MASS II, COURAGE, and BARI 2D studies. In fact, first-generation
drug-eluting stents (DES) may reduce recurrent ischemia compared with BMS, resulting in
fewer hospitalizations for repeat revascularization. However, data from meta-analysis
have been controversial to demonstrate advantage of DES in reducing late mortality or MI
rate, comparing to BMS. Kirtane et al.<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup><sup>]</sup> evaluated the safety and efficacy of DES among
"real-world" patients and those enrolled in pivotal randomized clinical trials (RCTs)
and data from 9,470 patients in 22 RCTs and from 182.901 patients in 34 observational
studies were included. In RCTs, no significant differences were observed in the
long-term rates of death or MI after DES or BMS use for either off-label or on-label
indications. Only in real-world observational studies, with greater numbers of patients
but the admitted potential for selection bias and residual confounding, DES was
associated with reduction of MI and mortality,</p><p>The specific evaluation of patients with stable coronary disease who underwent
implantation of BMS or DES, even showed more intriguing results. In the Norwegian
Coronary Stent Trial (NORSTENT) trial<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>, 9.013 patients were randomised to receive the
implantation of DES or BMS. In the group receiving DES, 96% of the patients received
either everolimus or zotarolimus-eluting stents. The primary outcome was a composite of
death from any cause and nonfatal spontaneous MI, after a median of 5 years of
follow-up. Secondary outcomes included repeat revascularization, stent thrombosis, and
quality of life. There were no significant differences in the components of the primary
outcome, and quality-of-life measures did not differ significantly between the two
groups. Only the rates of repeat revascularization were lower in the group receiving
DES.</p><p>On the other hand, the value of the decision making between aggressive or conservative
approach of stable coronary disease, made after invasive study of coronary anatomy, has
been questioned. In the ongoing International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness
with Medical and Invasive Approaches (ISCHEMIA) trial<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup><sup>]</sup> (NCT01471522), the main
difference in study design is to randomize patients with stable coronary disease to
invasive or conservative strategies, before catheterization. This is a multicenter
randomized controlled trial with a target enrollment about 5.000 patients with at least
moderate ischemia on stress imaging. The primary aim is to determine whether an initial
invasive strategy of cardiac catheterization and optimal revascularization (with PCI or
CABG, as determined by the local heart team) plus OMT will reduce the primary composite
endpoint of cardiovascular death or nonfatal MI, in stable patients with moderate or
severe ischemia and medically controllable or absent symptoms, comparing with an initial
conservative strategy. Enrollment began in late 2012 and is projected to end in 2017.
Average follow-up will be approximately 3 years. There are currently around 300
participating sites in more than 30 countries. The ISCHEMIA Trial thus aims to address
limitations of previous strategy trials by: 1) enrolling patients before
catheterization, so that anatomically high-risk patients are not excluded; 2) enrolling
a higher-risk group with at least moderate ischemia; 3) minimizing crossovers; 4) using
contemporary DES and physiologically guided decision making (FFR) to achieve complete
ischemic (rather than anatomic) revascularization; and 5) being adequately powered to
demonstrate whether routine revascularization reduces cardiovascular death or nonfatal
MI in patients with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) and at least moderate ischemia.
The results of the ISCHEMIA trial will have important implications regarding global
guidelines for performance and reimbursement of revascularization procedures in patients
with stable coronary disease.</p><p>However, while we wait the results of ISCHEMIA trial and other ongoing studies, the
ORBITA study is the best designed trial comparing conservative and interventional
strategies in patients with stable angina. The rigor with which the trial was carried
out and the conclusion that PCI has a powerful placebo effect, should have impact in
forthcomings guidelines of stable coronary disease.</p></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Al-Lamee</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Thompson</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Dehbi</surname><given-names>HM</given-names></name><name><surname>Sen</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Tang</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Davies</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><etal/><collab>ORBITA Investigators</collab></person-group><article-title>Percutaneous coronary intervention in stable angina (ORBITA): a

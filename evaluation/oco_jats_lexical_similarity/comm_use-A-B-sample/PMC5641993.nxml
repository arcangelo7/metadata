Additional anxiety related to hospitalization, social situation, and long-term body image compound the problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Frequent procedures and interventions, in which children cannot cooperate with or understand the need for, make the pediatric burn patient rife for significant anxiety and distress both at the time of and after injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Left untreated, anxiety can intensify into a pathway of fear, sleeplessness, depression, and helplessness that may render patients psychologically incapable of coping with their illness or treatment at the time of and after burn injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Early burn research contributed to the original classification of posttraumatic stress disorder in DSM-III; post-traumatic stress disorder criteria are met in 30% of severely burned children 6&#x000a0;months after injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">The purpose of this review is to define sedation and analgesia, define how burn injury impacts analgesic requirements, and describe the current pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic methods of treating pain and anxiety in children with burn injuries.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Review</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Definition of terms</title><p id="Par4">Understanding the differences between pain, distress, and fear is essential to establishing appropriate treatment algorithms for optimal pediatric burn sedation.</p><p id="Par5">Distress is defined as &#x0201c;an organism&#x02019;s response to aversive internal and external stimuli&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Anxiety is a response based on worry or apprehension, which may be linked to a perceived or real threat. Agitation is identified as a more intense level of nervous anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Fear differs in that it is an unpleasant emotion due to the belief that someone/thing is dangerous, may cause pain, or is a threat.</p><p id="Par6">Fear and anxiety may be difficult for medical providers to distinguish from pain, particularly in younger children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Distress and pain are difficult to discriminate, as these experiences may occur simultaneously, influence each other, and present with comparable responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Burn pain, specifically, is one of the most severe forms of acute pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Uncontrolled moderate to severe pain can impede proper wound care, physical therapy, and lengthen hospitalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A primary medical task of the burn unit is the relief of pain and anxiety, each of which can exacerbate the other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Sedation is defined as a calm tranquil state that allays anxiety and excitement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Sedation is further described as a medical procedure involving administration of sedative drugs, generally to facilitate a medical procedure, such as endoscopy, vasectomy, or minor surgery with local anesthesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. As such, sedation can be used to allay distress and/or fear. The first known use of sedation was in 1543 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Non-pharmacologic interventions for distress (or Anxiety), pain, and fear</title><p id="Par8">Initially, anxiety should be allayed with attempts to normalize the child&#x02019;s surroundings with non-pharmacologic interventions. Communication, continuous reorientation, reassurance, and the presence of relatives at the bedside can allay anxiety, while environmental factors such as noise reduction, utilization of adequately lighting to promote an adequate sleep awake cycle, promoting time to rest and sleep to maintain a circadian orientation, restricting procedures to daytime, keeping the patient in a comfortable position using cushions, and attention to fluids and feeding may improve comfort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Non-pharmacologic interventions to reduce stress, such as live or recorded music, have primarily been studied in adults, but make sense for children as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Use of earplugs, eye masks, noise reduction, and darkness for sleep promotion is uncommon in critical care settings; however, efforts to normalize the patient&#x02019;s routine may allow the child to feel more secure and less anxious [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">The normal young child spends a majority of his or her time in play. When children are confined to their ICU bed, both their schedule and their sense of self and normalcy are compromised. The play specialist has an important role in the pain, fear, and distress management in the Pediatric and Burn ICU, assessing children and introducing individualized distraction therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Beyond scheduling, the hospital environment is significantly different from a child&#x02019;s daily norm. Light and noise, for example, can be disturbing. Allowing children to wear ear plugs, asking staff to speak softly, and preventing ongoing alarm sounds can be helpful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Environmental noise in critical care units ranges from 60 to 84&#x000a0;dB, with the World Health Organization defining 55&#x000a0;dB as serious annoyance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. For children, in an environment that is foreign, it is even more important to provide calm soothing sounds to minimize disturbances or provoke nighttime fears [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Pharmacologic interventions for sedation</title><p id="Par11">Non-pharmacologic interventions continue to have importance in the care of the burned child, but frequently are inadequate to fully treat pain and anxiety. Analgesia and sedation are essential elements in patient care in the ICU to control pain, anxiety, and agitation; prevent the loss of devices or accidental extubation; and improve the synchrony of the patient with mechanical ventilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The ideal sedative agent should have rapid onset, short duration of action, minimal active metabolites, few side effects, predictable pharmacokinetics (PK), and cost-effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Additional issues to consider are hemodynamic changes, patient and family satisfaction, ease of maintaining desired level of sedation, recovery time, and risk of adverse events. To achieve the best possible outcome, interdisciplinary collaboration of nurses, physicians, and hospital pharmacists/clinical pharmacologists is warranted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Sedation is a wide-ranging topic with multiple subcategories. There are two main types of sedation in burn patients: procedural sedation and ongoing sedation, particularly in the intubated patient.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Procedural sedation</title><p id="Par13">Procedural sedation is defined as using amnestic, anxiolytic, or analgesic agents to prevent the child from remembering or feeling painful procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The number of noninvasive and minimally invasive procedures performed outside of the operating room has grown exponentially over the last several decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Although procedures are an integral part of the care of burn patients, they can also be disruptive. Regular burn wound care procedures can cause extreme pain and fear, which can result in posttraumatic stress disorder, psychological sequelae, or chronic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Percent of total body surface burned is associated with increased procedural anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Once sedation is determined to be necessary, the provider needs to determine the depth of sedation that will be required (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Minimal sedation (anxiolysis) is a drug-induced state during which patients respond normally to verbal commands. Although cognitive function and physical coordination may be impaired, airway reflexes and ventilatory and cardiovascular functions are unaffected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This level of sedation is ideal for non-pharmacologic modalities. Moderate sedation (conscious sedation) is a drug-induced depression of consciousness during which patients respond purposefully to verbal commands, either alone or accompanied by light tactile stimulation. No interventions are required to maintain a patent airway, spontaneous ventilation is adequate, and cardiovascular function is usually maintained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Patients should be monitored continuously with noninterruptive technologies such as continuous pulse oximetry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Deep sedation is a drug-induced depression of consciousness during which patients cannot be easily aroused but respond purposefully following repeated or painful stimulation. Although cardiac function is maintained, the ability to independently maintain respiratory function may be impaired; hence, the patient may require assistance in maintaining a patent airway, and spontaneous ventilation may be inadequate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Deep sedation for children, with its higher risks of complication, requires use of the appropriate drug that is prescribed and administered by qualified personnel under strict guidelines to avoid potential complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. For wound care, any sedation above the minimal&#x000a0;level requires qualified personnel prepared to manage an airway, given that a greater depth of anesthesia may occur than what was anticipated/planned.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Sedation levels (DDD)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Minimal sedation</th><th>Moderate sedation</th><th>Deep sedation</th><th>General anesthesia</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Responsiveness</td><td>Normal response to verbal stimulation</td><td>Purposeful response to verbal or tactile stimulation</td><td>Purposeful response following repeated or painful stimulation</td><td>Unarousable even with painful stimulus</td></tr><tr><td>Airway</td><td>Unaffected</td><td>No intervention required</td><td>Intervention may be required</td><td>Intervention often required</td></tr><tr><td>Spontaneous Ventilation</td><td>Unaffected</td><td>Adequate</td><td>May be inadequate</td><td>Frequently inadequate</td></tr><tr><td>Cardiovascular function</td><td>Unaffected</td><td>Usually maintained</td><td>Usually maintained</td><td>May be impaired</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>
</p><p id="Par15">Pediatric sedation and analgesia practices differ from adults due to characteristics inherent to children, including small size and cognitive immaturity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Serious associated risks are associated with pediatric sedation including hypoventilation, apnea, airway obstruction, laryngospasm, and cardiopulmonary impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The risks increase as the level of sedation deepens. Further, adverse outcomes may be increased when two or more sedating medications are administered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. And since every child is different, the risks will vary. In particular, children with developmental disabilities have a threefold increased incidence of desaturation compared with children without developmental disabilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Challenges for sedation in burned children, not presented in other population, include donor site pain and complex wound care, inhalation injury, presence of burn hypermetabolism, and pain associated with burn wounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Burn injury markedly alters the PK and pharmacodynamics (PD) of many drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">The stress of inpatient treatment, specifically a burn dressing change, has been compared with &#x0201c;inescapable shock&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;learned helplessness&#x0201d; for pediatric burn patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The degree of dissociative symptoms measured shortly after the burn is a direct predictor of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Early usage of appropriate sedation for burn wound care allows for early aggressive wound debridement, virtually eliminating the need for operating room debridement, and may eliminate patient discomfort and fear often associated with subsequent debridements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Ongoing sedation in the ventilated patient</title><p id="Par17">Perhaps one of the most challenging components of pediatric critical care is sedation of mechanically ventilated children. The goal of sedation for both intubated and nonintubated patients is to attain a calm but responsive state that protects the young patient from self-harm. An ideal level of sedation in ventilated patients, however, is described as a state in which the patient is sleepy, responding to environmental stimuli, without risks and excessive movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In an intubated patient, this means that a child is conscious, breathes in synergy with the ventilator, and is tolerant or compliant to other therapeutic procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. An arousal target of light sedation in this setting is most likely to improve patient outcome from critical illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Administration of sedatives to critically ill patients may be complicated by unpredictable PK and PD due to internal factors (impaired organ function, drug interactions, altered protein binding, and fluctuating volumes of distribution) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. External factors that can change PK and PD of sedative drugs include renal replacement therapy, ECMO, and hypothermia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The age distribution of children admitted to pediatric intensive care units with associated differences in metabolism of many drugs due to variable enzyme kinetics complicates optimal dosing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Appropriate sedative and analgesic therapy of intubated, critically injured, pediatric burn patients is challenging due to the severity of the child&#x02019;s illness, burn-associated alterations in drug metabolism, and rapid development of tolerance to the most commonly used sedative agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Burn injury also alters the metabolic clearance of many sedatives and analgesics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The stress caused by the burn injury itself, together with the co-administration of opiates and sedatives, can induce tolerance and even opiate-induced hyperalgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Thus, in patients who need protracted mechanical ventilation, the &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; doses of benzodiazepine and opiate medications often become inadequate, resulting in dose escalation or addition of other drugs, to achieve effectively the desired effect.</p><p id="Par19">The inability to communicate is compounded by the child&#x02019;s cognitive limitations, making sedation particularly challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Over 90% of infants and children supported on mechanical ventilation receive some form of sedative therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Appropriate use of sedatives, in these difficult-to-treat patients, reduces anxiety, optimizes patients&#x02019; comfort, and improves outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Contrary to procedural sedation, which has a fixed duration and specific purpose, ongoing sedation has indeterminate duration and sedation depth. Also, unlike procedural sedation, continuous sedation infusion is but one part of a multilayered and complex care plan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Lack of consensus guidelines for sedation and analgesia delivery to pediatric intensive care unit patients result in practice variation, and regional attitudes can influence the practices and management of sedation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. To achieve optimal sedation in critically ill patients, the use of sedation guidelines, protocols, and algorithms has been advocated by various societies as a means of improving practice and standardizing care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The level of sedation should be regularly assessed and documented using a validated scoring system, each patient&#x02019;s desired level of sedation should be identified and regularly reassessed, and doses of sedative agents should be titrated to produce the desired level of sedation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A system for determining sedation efficacy is important because sedation is a continuum and individual patient responses are unpredictable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Despite widespread recommendation for the use of sedation guidelines, protocols, and algorithms in critically ill children, there is a paucity of high-quality evidence to guide this practice. More robust studies are urgently needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">Inadequate sedation, whether insufficient or excessive, has common side effects, such as an increase in the duration of mechanical ventilation, hospital-acquired infections (in particular ventilator associated pneumonia), hemodynamic instability, unplanned extubation or failure of extubation, development of withdrawal syndromes, and long-term adverse neuropsychological outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Excess sedative medications increase morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Profound sedation in the first 24&#x000a0;h increases mechanical ventilation duration by 12&#x000a0;h, in-hospital mortality by 10%, and 180&#x000a0;day mortality by 8% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Insufficient or excessive sedation is likely to add to the personal and financial burden of intensive care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">In one study, optimal sedation was achieved in 57.6% of sedation assessments, undersedation in 10.6% and oversedation in 31.8% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. After implementation of protocols for systematic management of sedation, analgesia, and delirium, the mean ICU length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation is shorter (5.43 vs 6.39 and 5.95 vs 7.27) and the proportion of patients with appropriate sedation increases from 57 to 66.6% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Patients who were managed using sedation protocols are 23% more likely to be taken off all sedation compared to physician-directed approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], and the median duration of sedation is reduced in sedation guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. All members of the complex critical care team, doctors, nurses, therapists, and techs, need to have a common understanding of the goals of sedation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Medications</title><p id="Par23">The appropriate techniques for sedation/analgesia are dependent on the experience and preference of the individual practitioner, requirements, or constraints imposed by the patient or procedure, and the likelihood of producing a deeper level of sedation than anticipated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The choice of sedative agent depends on the efficacy and safety profile of the agent as well as its relative safety and efficacy compared to other medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. For burn patients specifically, one must not only consider the age of the patient but also the location of the burn, burn depth, burn extent (percent), and time of debridement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].

The catecholamine responses to burn injury are compounded by increased renin-angiotensin activity, particularly in burned children. These endogenous vasoactive hormones result in hypertension or maintenance of normotension even during relative hypovolemia after burn injury. The use of any sedative drug in burned patients, who have high sympathetic tone, may require high fluid volumes to maintain normotension whether it be dexmedetomidine, midazolam, or morphine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In a study of 42 pediatric burn patients, comparing dexmedetomidine to midazolam, hypotensive episodes were more common in the midazolam group (mean 29.7 vs 15.8) with midazolam having twice the number of incidents per day (1.5 vs 0.7).

Addiction is a complex pattern of behaviors characterized by the repetitive compulsive use of a substance, antisocial or criminal behavior to obtain the drug, and a high incidence of relapse after treatment. Psychological dependency and addiction are extremely rare after the appropriate use of sedative/analgesic agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p id="Par60">Having patients who are both pediatric and burn injured compounds the difficulties of tolerance and dependency. Burn injury causes pathophysiologic alterations to plasma protein concentrations and renal and hepatic function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The skins hold much of the body&#x02019;s albumin stores, which are directly lost after an extensive burn injury. As a result, plasma free fraction, volume of distribution, and clearance of drugs may be affected. Drugs usually bound by albumin, such as benzodiazepines, may undergo faster clearance in the burn patient, because the drug exists as free fraction for glomerular filtration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Thus, maintaining appropriate sedation and analgesia in pediatric burn patients can be quite challenging and often requires high doses of analgesics and anxiolytics because tolerance quickly develops. Escalating doses of opioids and benzodiazepines provides little additional benefit while increasing the incidence of side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Some have postulated that if the sedation regimen is rotated, it may decrease or delay the onset of tolerance, but this theory needs more study prior to widespread adaption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Withdrawal</title><p id="Par61">Withdrawal, also referred to as abstinence syndrome, includes the physical signs and symptoms that manifest when the administration of a sedative or analgesic agent is abruptly discontinued in a patient who is physically, tolerant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. This tends to be the problem of continuous infusions, rather than intermittent dosing for wound care. The risk of withdrawal increases with prolonged administration of high doses of medications, rising to over 50% after 5&#x000a0;days of continuous infusion or around-the-clock administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Withdrawal is often associated with cumulative doses greater than or equal to 60&#x000a0;mg/kg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p><p id="Par62">The abrupt discontinuation or rapid weaning causes central nervous system hyperirritability, autonomic system dysregulation, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and motor abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Most common symptoms are agitation, irritability, anxiety, insomnia, tachycardia, hypertension, and sweating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. But the presenting symptoms vary and may be affected by several factors including the agent involved, the patient&#x02019;s age, cognitive state, and associated medical conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Time to onset of withdrawal symptoms may vary depending on the half-life of the agent and the half-life of active metabolites, which may be several times longer than the parent compound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Withdrawal usually occurs from 1 to 48&#x000a0;h after tapering off or discontinuation of a drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], but may be as late as 6&#x000a0;days after commencement of tapering greater than 10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Thus, signs and symptoms vary from patient to patient in number, severity, and presentation causing confusion and difficulty with diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p id="Par63">Withdrawal estimates vary from 10 - 34% of all PICU patients in Europe to 34&#x02013;70% in international PICU patients with subsequent increased morbidity, length of stay, and psychological alterations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In pediatric burn centers, 53.7% reported the presence of withdrawal signs and symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The incidence of withdrawal syndrome specific to midazolam has been estimated between 17 and 30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par64">Withdrawal symptoms for benzodiazepines and opioids had a large overlap for symptoms such as agitation, anxiety, tremors, insomnia, hyperpyrexia, diaphoresis, tachypnea, and tachycardia. Symptoms such as hallucinations, psychomotor agitation with perceptual disorders, depersonalization, and seizures have been described primarily as benzodiazepine withdrawal in PICU patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Other symptoms include frequent yawning, sneezing, hypertonicity, clonus, and nasal stuffiness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Withdrawal is more likely in patients treated with propofol for &#x0003e;1&#x000a0;day. Symptoms of withdrawal include confusion, tremulousness, hallucinations, seizures, generalized twitching, and jitteriness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p id="Par65">To date, there are no reports that demonstrate withdrawal after the prolonged administration of ketamine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Strategies to mitigate sedation complications</title><p id="Par66">The most common method for decreasing sedative use is the daily scheduled sedation &#x0201c;vacation.&#x0201d; Wake-up protocols, where infusions are held until there is reversal of sedation and patients are able to follow commands, are associated with decreases in mechanical ventilation duration, length of ICU-level care, and complications such as a ventilator-associated pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, and sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Recent studies have demonstrated successful use of daily interruption in PICUs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Daily sedation interruption in children is feasible and safe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p id="Par67">A parallel strategy for decreasing dosing and duration of sedation is to target light sedation levels consistently throughout the day using validated sedation scoring scales. Combining targeted light sedation with daily sedation interruption may be more beneficial than either method alone if sedation doses are reduced and arousal and mobility are facilitated during the ICU stay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Regardless of the strategy employed, a consistent finding across all trials of daily sedation interruption and/or targeted light sedation is that clinical outcomes are improved when sedative doses are significantly reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p id="Par68">Prevention of withdrawal includes slowly tapering the intravenous administration or, depending on the drug, switching to subcutaneous or oral administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. A validated opioid or benzodiazepine weaning regimen does not exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Based on a few prospective studies, several authors recommend a daily tapering rate of 1&#x02013;20% for children who receive benzodiazepines and/or opioids for more than 5&#x02013;7&#x000a0;days. This strategy did not result in the absence of withdrawal symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Seemingly, much of the burn community agrees, as a survey found that most centers gradually wean off agents to mitigate withdrawal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Adjuncts used to decrease withdrawal include methadone, lorazepam, and clonidine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par69">Unfortunately, again, the PICU practitioners seem to be behind the adult units with incorporating these techniques into daily practice. A Canadian survey of PICUs in 2015 found only 5% of respondents practiced daily interruption of continuous sedation and analgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Pediatric burn units appear to be more in line with literature. A survey in 2016 found that 60.9% of pediatric burn units report practicing sedation holidays &#x0201c;always&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;usually&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par70">Further study needs to be undertaken to create consensus and &#x0201c;gold standards&#x0201d; for pediatric sedation practices. Practices need to be based on valid, high fidelity research. Areas in need of further study include sedation scoring systems, techniques for avoidance of tolerance and dependency, ways to minimize withdrawal and delirium, and mechanisms for limiting sedative medication dosages and duration. Further, we need to further explore non-pharmacologic methods for sedation such as music therapy, maintenance of sleep hygiene, and ideal family presence. As elegantly stated in a survey of pediatric burn centers, best practices for administration and monitoring of pediatric sedation have not been clearly defined, but objective sedative and analgesia measures and targets are worthy pursuits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>None</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par71">The authors received no funding for this work.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par72">Not applicable</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p id="Par73">AF and TLP contributed to the concept, writing, content, and editing of this manuscript.

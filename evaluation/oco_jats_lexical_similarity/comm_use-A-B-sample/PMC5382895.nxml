Surgery (BJCVS) in 2016, rewarding the good reviewers for their excellent performance is
a goal set by the publication team.</p><p>The reviewers are the ones who are responsible for spreading the valorization and the
qualification of our scientific publications in the national and international
scope.</p><p>In an article published in Nature<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> in
2014, the author expresses concern about the sustainability and quality of the peer
review system, a fact proven by his own experience and his colleagues when receiving
inadequate opinions, showing a lack of understanding of the content by the reviewer. The
increasing number of online journals in recent decades has been contributing to
reviewers&#x02019; overload. In addition to that, the editorial policy of some open access
journals is to publish articles whose methodology is valid and which &#x0201c;has its accuracy
and validity certified, regardless of the evaluation of its content.&#x0201d; This
recommendation may sound to reviewers as a signal to approve articles only based on
analysis of methods and statistics sections, without considering the reasons why it was
conducted and its broader context.</p><p>According to Lilian Nassi-Cal&#x000f2;<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>, a Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO) collaborator, &#x0201c;Peer
evaluation has been going through a transition period and many believe it is necessary
to redefine its principles and practices in order not to delay or impede the scientific
progress. In this regard, alternatives to the traditional arbitration model have
recently emerged, which is usually closed, maintaining the identity of the reviewers
(single-blind system) and also the authors (double-blind system) confidential. It is
interesting to point out that since 1833 closed and anonymous opinions prevailed, since
it was not considered appropriate or cordial to publicly review a colleague&#x02019;s work,
moreover, opinions were not considered a personal expression, but represented the
author&#x02019;s hierarchy.</p><p>There are several models to reward the reviewers, but the most cogitated one in recent
times proposes the public recognition of the evaluators to give prestige to this
important stage of the publishing process of scientific publication and, consequently
help improve the quality of revisions.</p><p>The BJCVS, with the intention of honoring its reviewers, joined the [Publons], a website
that was created to record the input of peer reviewers and influence researchers to
offer their experiences as reviewers.</p><p>According to an online interview, see below the opinion of Andrew Preston<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>, co-founder of [Publons]. All reviewers
should sign up at [Publons] to register their revisions both before and after the online
publication. The manuscript, prior and after to the reviews, is not disclosed, unless
allowed by the journal. However, we request the authors the review certificate or we
check with the editors to make sure the review was performed by the one selected for
such task. To increase our performance, we are working to automate the system, speeding
up the update of all reviewers. Even when a journal opts for anonymous reviews, our
platform may give credit to reviewers. It&#x02019;s easily understood that when you are selected
as reviewer of an article, the publisher is demonstrating that you are considered a
specialist in that subject. [Publons] is a great way to highlight this experience. Our
users are beginning to use their certificates as reviewers on their curriculums, and
also to be recommended for the journals&#x02019; boards, or selected as associate or full
editors.</p><p>Predicting that the reviewer&#x02019;s activity would be one day recognized, the BJCVS has been
issuing certificates for each review carried out by its collaborators since 2002.</p><p>These data are also filed in our databases, and can be obtained by their request.</p><p>In order to make the reviewer&#x02019;s activity more recognized, we have long been claiming that
&#x0201c;CAPES - Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel in Brazil&#x0201d;
should consider this procedure of high relevance, essential to guide authors in
correcting flaws, either in form or content, increasing the quality of journal&#x02019;s
articles, fundamental measure for the research&#x02019;s be cited, resulting in the increase of
the Impact Factor, placing our country in the spotlight of the Concert of Nations. One
day, we hope to be able to obtain this benefit by valuing the revisions as if they were
&#x0201c;scientific articles&#x0201d;. The [Publons] may represent a new argument with the CAPES
leaders, so that our idea can be accepted. For this reason and for the benefit it
represents in curriculum content, we recommend that all associated editors and reviewers
of the BJCVS, as well as the authors, who will at some point be invited to be reviewers,
sign up for [Publons] by accessing the link: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://publons.com/home/">https://Publons.com/home/</ext-link>.</p><p>I hope that reading this first issue of 2017 will be interesting for all who can find in
our journal a source of knowledge and incentive to promote it nationally and
internationally.</p><p>Warmest regards!</p><sig-block><sig><bold>Domingo M.

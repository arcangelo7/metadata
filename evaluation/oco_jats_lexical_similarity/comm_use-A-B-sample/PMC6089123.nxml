ranged from 10 days to 145 months; 30 (50.8%) patients had single left
ventricle and 29 (49.2%) had single right ventricle (48.2% of these
presented with hypoplastic left heart syndrome [HLHS]). Patients with single
left ventricle had a higher percentage of reintervention-free survival, but
without statistically significant difference. 40% of the patients had no
complications and 35% of them presented with thrombosis at some point in the
follow-up period, with ventricular dysfunction being the second most
frequently found complication (15% of cases), mainly among patients with
single right ventricle morphology (<italic>P</italic>=0.04). Between the
patients currently under follow-up, 20 (35%) of them had been evaluated by
ultrasonography and had some degree of hepatic congestion and/or
hepatomegaly. 16.7% of the patients with such alteration had HLHS

different anatomical combinations that culminate in a common characteristic: a
single ventricle responds by both the systemic and pulmonary circulations. In most
cases, it is possible to confirm the presence of two distinct ventricles, right and
left, one being hypoplastic and called rudimentary and the other being well formed
and called the main chamber.</p><p>One of the most common anatomic forms is the tricuspid atresia, with different
presentations, which is responsible for 1.5-3% of congenital heart diseases and is
present in approximately 0.6 out of every 10,000 live births. Another dominant left
ventricular presentation is the pulmonary atresia, with intact interventricular
septum, which accounts for about 1% of congenital heart diseases, occurring in about
0.7 out of every 10,000 newborns. Regarding to the dominant right ventricle, the
main anatomical representation is the hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), which
represents about 2% of congenital heart diseases, being present in approximately
four out of every 10,000 newborns.</p><p>The natural history of single ventricular hearts is quite unfavorable: 64% of the
patients were diagnosed during childhood and 50% in the neonatal period.</p><p>Treatment is usually performed through surgical staging, with interventions beginning
in the neonatal period and culminating in the completion of a total cavopulmonary
operation (Fontan)<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>, as a final stage.</p><p>The total cavopulmonary bypass allows close-to-normal saturation to these patients,
decreasing the demand of the systemic ventricle. Despite this, it maintains altered
hemodynamics leading to a series of late complications, among them, physical
capacity reduction, ventricular dysfunction, intra- or extracardiac thrombi,
arrhythmias, protein-losing enteropathy (PLE), and cirrhosis.</p><p>We carried out this study in order to evaluate the complications presented in the
population submitted to total cavopulmonary bypass, with late follow-up at our
institution, and to assess factors that may predispose to these complications, in
addition to estimate the reintervention-free survival.</p><sec><title>Primary Goals</title><p>

the Single Ventricle Heart outpatient clinic of the Hospital do
Cora&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o (S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil). To do so, we considered all
patients undergoing total cavopulmonary bypass between 2000 and 2014. Patients with
early death (in-hospital) and those under ambulatory follow-up at other institutions
were excluded.</p><p>Anatomical and surgical data were obtained through a medical record survey conducted
during in-hospital period and then outpatient follow-up.</p><p>Regarding the data of the surgical moment, we evaluated: diagnosis, staging
performed, age of total cavopulmonary derivation, fenestration, pulmonary artery
angioplasty/stenting, preoperative pulmonary pressure, preoperative pulmonary
strength, and need for reintervention.</p><p>Concerning the late follow-up, we evaluated the occurrence of main late
complications, such as: thrombi, arrhythmias, ventricular dysfunction, PLE, plastic
bronchitis, and changes in hepatic parenchyma through abdominal USG.</p><p>Considering main late complications, we tried to identify factors that could
interfere in the occurrence of complications and reintervention-free survival.</p><p>Initially all variables were analyzed descriptively. Analysis of quantitative
variables was done by observing the minimum and maximum values and calculating
means, standard deviations and median. Absolute and relative frequencies were
calculated for qualitative variables. To test the homogeneity between proportions,
chi-square test<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup><sup>]</sup> or Fisher's exact test was used.</p><p>The study of time until reintervention was performed through Kaplan-Meyer curve with
log-rank test<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. The software used for the calculations was SPSS
17.0 for Windows(r).</p><p>The level of significance used for the tests was 5%.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>During the study (from 2000 to 2014), 150 total cavopulmonary shunt operations were
performed with an extracardiac conduit. Of these, 59 patients were followed-up at

patients currently undergoing follow-up, 20 (35%) have been evaluated by USG and 10
(50%) presented with some degree of hepatic congestion and/or hepatomegaly. Between
patients with this alteration, 16.7% of them had HLHS (<italic>P</italic>=0.057),
60% presented with pulmonary pressure &#x0003e; 15 mmHg and in 54% of them the tube was
not fenestrated (<italic>P</italic>=1.00).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Evolution and improvement in diagnosis, indication, surgical techniques, and
postoperative care of patients with univentricular hearts have allowed an increasing
survival rate of these patients, with quality of life quite close to normal. Thus,
learning about the late complications to which this group of patients is subjected
is fundamental. To improve care, it is essential to look at this group of patients
in order to assess their demands.</p><p>Current late complications still very much resemble those found in recent years in
the literature, even with the improvement of the technique proposed by Fontan in
1971<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>.</p><p>With the use of the technique based on extracardiac tube (technique used in all
patients in this study), the difference in morbidity and mortality was mainly due to
the occurrence of arrhythmias: the use of extracardiac tube to derive the flow from
the inferior vena cava to the right pulmonary artery reduced significantly this
occurrence<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>.</p><p>The use of the extracardiac polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tube in all cavopulmonary
bypass surgeries at our service without atrial scarring and without altering the
atrium architecture justifies the absence of arrhythmias in the follow-up group at
our center.</p><p>Currently, at the Hospital do Cora&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o, all patients undergoing total
cavopulmonary shunt are maintained using subcutaneous enoxaparin sodium, dose of 1
mg/kg/dose, 12/12 hours, until stabilization and possibility of oral
anticoagulation. Oral anticoagulation is the prophylaxis of choice for thrombosis in
these patients in the first two postoperative years and it is not performed in
patients with social contraindication or drug intolerance. After two years, in the
absence of episodes of thrombosis, all patients started to use ASA as prophylaxis,
indefinitely. During follow-up, all patients underwent transesophageal
echocardiography to evaluate the possibility of thrombi in the Fontan circuit, in
five days, 90 days, 180 days, nine months, one year, 18 months, and two years
postoperatively; after two years, they were evaluated once a year or whenever it was
necessary. Thrombosis occurred in 35% of the patients, a higher occurrence than it
is usually shown in the literature: 0-16% and 4.6%, according to some
reports<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>, especially in the extracardiac tube and with no
difference between the groups using ASA or oral anticoagulant, similar to a finding
in a multicenter study published in 2011, which has found a 21% occurrence of
thrombosis in the ASA group and 24% in the oral anticoagulant
group<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>.</p><p>Another prospective study carried out in our department followed for two years a
group of 40 patients submitted to cavopulmonary bypass, 20 in use of antiplatelet
agent and 20 in use of oral anticoagulant, evidencing the absence of a statistically
significant relation in the occurrence of thrombosis between the two groups, but
showing a trend towards a greater deposit of material on the wall of the
extracardiac tube, which was evidenced by computed tomography, in patients taking
ASA<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>.</p><p>PLE is a serious event; its occurrence is found in most of the literature ranging
from 1% to 5% of the patients and it has a 50% mortality rate in 5
years<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>.</p><p>Of the patients followed-up in our center, 7% developed with such complication. Among
them, one required surgical intervention for the correction of major mitral valve
insufficiency, with resolution of the condition. In a second case, we chose to
perform a fenestration, and the child evolved to death postoperatively. Since the
beginning of the use of oral budesonide in our service for the treatment of PLE, all
other patients had this condition resolved, maintaining a serum level of albumin
&#x0003e; 3 g/dL.</p><p>Regarding the ventricular dysfunction, it is a constant concern in the late follow-up
of patients with univentricular heart morphology, because in addition to the cardiac
insufficiency manifested in patients with ventricular dysfunction of any nature, it
may compromise the operation of the Fontan type circuit, leading to pulmonary
venocapilar congestion. Its occurrence was higher in patients with single ventricle
of right morphology in our series and because of this the concern to preserve this
ventricle is greater since the beginning of the follow-up. A study based on records
from Australia and New Zealand of patients undergoing Fontan surgery (1268 in 2015)
showed 7% of patients on (angiotensin converting enzyme) ACE inhibitors in order to
preserve normal function and 36% systolic or diastolic dysfunction of the single
ventricle. The use prevailed in patients with right ventricular morphology
(70%)<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>.</p><p>Among the patients currently under follow-up, 35% have already underwent abdominal
USG and 50% of them have alterations characterized by hepatic congestion. Between
those, 16.7% of the alterations are in patients with HLHS (P=0.057). Hepatic
impairment has been widely studied these days, being found from congestion to liver
fibrosis and cirrhosis, changes that are directly related to the time since total
cavopulmonary derivation<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>.</p><p>Current studies have shown a concern in proposing a protocol to evaluate liver
changes in relation to periodicity of computed tomography, magnetic resonance
imaging, and liver biopsy in search for precursor changes of
hepatocarcinoma<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Complications such as thrombi and PLE were present in the assessed group during
outpatient follow-up, but no notable relation with any of the pre or intraoperative
factors assessed was found, so it remains a challenge to establish the best way to
prevent and treat such complications in patients undergoing total cavopulmonary
shunt.</p><p>No patient so far has evolved with arrhythmias or plastic bronchitis. Among the
patients in follow-up, two had death as an outcome.</p><p>Among the evaluated causes that could interfere in the complications found, only the
right ventricular morphology was statistically significant with ventricular
dysfunction.</p><p>Regarding the hepatic congestion, the abdominal USG has shown signs of hepatic
congestion in 50% of the evaluated cases, and a significant portion of them has been
diagnosed with HLHS.</p><p>In order to evaluate parenchymal alterations, the indication of computed tomography
and liver biopsy may be considered in patients with sign of congestion.</p><p>It is important to consider a better evaluation throughout this follow-up, trying to
identify tissue changes, which are possibly precursors of hepatocellular
carcinoma</p><table-wrap id="t4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="5%" span="1"/><col width="95%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CFXP</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Substantial contributions to the

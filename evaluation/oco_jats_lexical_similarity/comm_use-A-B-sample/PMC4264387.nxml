The European region of WHO has also seen an upsurge in measles cases with outbreaks in several countries including Georgia, Turkey and Ukraine.</p><p>In 2010, the World Health Assembly (WHA&#x000a0;63.18) established three milestones to be achieved by 2015 on the road towards measles eradication.</p><p>One milestone is to increase to 90% the percent of children aged 1&#x000a0;year who have received the first of two recommended doses of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1), but this coverage has been stagnant at around 83% since 2009.</p><p>The other goals &#x02013; to reduce and maintain annual measles incidence to fewer than 5&#x000a0;cases per million and to reduce measles deaths by more than 95% of the estimated level for the year 2000 &#x02013; are also off track.</p><p>&#x0201c;Poor progress in increasing measles vaccination coverage has resulted in large outbreaks of this highly contagious disease, throwing the 2015 elimination targets off track,&#x0201d; said Dr&#x000a0;Peter Strebel from the WHO Department of Immunization, Vaccines, and Biologicals.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/wer">http://www.who.int/wer</ext-link>

As a result, the number of people diagnosed with this form of tuberculosis has tripled globally, reaching 136&#x000a0;000 in 2013, but only 97&#x000a0;000 of them were put on treatment in that year, according to the WHO report.</p><p>&#x0201c;With improved diagnostic tools and access [to them] we are now detecting and treating more cases,&#x0201d; says Dr&#x000a0;Karin Weyer, coordinator for Laboratories, Diagnostics and Drug Resistance at WHO. &#x0201c;But the gap between detecting and actually getting people started on treatment is widening and we urgently need increased commitment and funding to test and successfully treat every case.&#x0201d;</p><p>A special supplement to this year&#x02019;s WHO report marks 20&#x000a0;years of anti-tuberculosis drug-resistance surveillance.

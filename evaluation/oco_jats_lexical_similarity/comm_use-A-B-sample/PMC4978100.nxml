In this study, an androgen receptor (AR) inhibitor called ASC-J9 is used to demonstrate the concept and feasibility of fabricating drug-loaded scafolds via electrospinning. Inhibition of androgen is known to promote skin wound healing. The novel ASC-J9 &#x02014; loaded porous scafold was fabricated for skin wound repair using electrospun fibers of collagen and polycaprolactone (PCL) blend. Our preliminary results indicated that ASC-J9 &#x02014; loaded scafolds facilitated more efficient attachment and ingrowth of dermal fbroblasts, compared to the control collagen-PCL scafold. A signifcant increase of cell proliferation was observed with the drug-loaded scafold over a 28-day period. The drug-loaded scafold also accelerated keratinocyte migration and wound closure in a contraction-inhibited mouse wound model over 21 days. The data indicated a sustained release of ASC-J9 from the scafold and its potential to accelerate wound healing by promoting cell proliferation and migration over an extended period of time. More importantly, our results proved the concept and feasibility of fabricating drug-releasing or bioactive dermal scaffolds for more efective wound healing.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Key words</title><kwd>Wound healing</kwd><kwd>electrospun scafold</kwd><kwd>adrogen receptor inhibition</kwd><kwd>ASC-J9</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2013</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>The patients with extensive burn injuries always have limited donor sites for skin grafting.

Dermal regenerative bioscaffold, stem cell resources, and various biofactors are essential for skin tissue engineering. Currently, there are many researches of skin engineering that have focused mainly on scaffold structures and morphology, especially the properties such as porosity and pore size, and how they influence cell-scaffold interactions. While current dermal regenerative templates promote wound healing and provide wound closure, they are still far from being perfect. The niche environment of current dermal scaffolds usually lacks a sufficient level of biological cues that could induce or stimulate cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation to accelerate wound healing and better skin regeneration. Consequently, delayed wound healing could lead to severe scarring and wound contraction. The unsatisfactory outcome, in fact, highlighted an aspect of skin tissue engineering that needs further improvement, which is to develop a better scaffold that could provide biological cues as well as a temporal and spatial environment for scaffolding of cells.</p><p>Deliveries of various biofactors including epidermal growth factor (EGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) have been a trendy strategy for promoting angiogenesis, wound healing, and tissue engineering. Hormones and growth factors including androgen, EGF, FGF, and angiogenic factors are known to play critical roles in skin regeneration. They could stimulate the proliferation and migration of keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells to promote angiogenesis and wound healing.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] The regulation of androgen and its receptors could modulate wound healing.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] The hydrogel or gelatin microsphere was proved effective as matrices for controlled delivery of growth factors for wound healing.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] However, to produce a growth factor-releasing electrospun scaffold remains a challenge as the growth factor could lose its bioactivity during the harsh process of scaffold fabrication.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] In this study, we tried an alternative strategy to incorporate a chemical compound that was demonstrated to regulate the activities of androgen in wound healing. The drug chosen for this study was ASC-J9 (5-hydroxy-1,7-bis (3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-1,4,6-heptatrien-3-one), a synthetic anti-androgen agent[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] which enhances androgen receptor (AR) degradation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] It is of the same family as flutamide that blocks the interaction between androgens and their receptors to promote wound closure.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] ARs have been found to be expressed in the keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts of healing skin[6] and are able to induce collagen expression in dermal fibroblasts.[10] ARs are also thought to indirectly modulate fibroblast proliferation in addition to collagen synthesis via Transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b2;1.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] A previous study showed that topical application of an ASC &#x02014; J9 &#x02014; containing cream accelerated re-epithelialization which was likely to be a result of suppression of local tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1; expression.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] Due to ASC-J9&#x02019;s chemical stability and advantageous results in promoting wound healing, it was chosen for this study to demonstrate the principle of drug release from electrospun scaffolds for wound healing.</p><p>The aim of this study was, therefore, to develop a bioactive scaffold which harnessed the properties of ASC-J9 to accelerate wound healing in a collagen &#x02014; polycaprolactone (PCL) &#x02014; ASC-J9 (CPA) composite scaffold. The bioactive scaffolds could potentially facilitate more efficient cell migration, growth, and differentiation for wound healing and skin regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Materials</title><p>Rat tail collagen type I was purchased from BD Biosciences, San Jose, USA.

While bioscaffolds provide structural support, and guidance for the attachment and migration of dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes, the biochemical factors and their regulation further induce and promote the cell proliferation, ingrowth, and differentiation for more effective wound healing and regeneration of dermal and epidermal tissues. In cell culture, the defined media provide a rich source of essential nutritious ingredients, biofactors, and other supplements. Under <italic>in vivo</italic> situation, the essential supply needed for wound healing and skin regeneration could only depend on the diffusion of nutritious ingredients, vascularization, and blood supply in the wound region. Fabrication of bioactive factors in the scaffold would provide the cells with extra supplements to ensure more effective cell migration, proliferation, or differentiation in addition to bioscaffolding and, therefore, accelerate tissue regeneration and wound closure.</p><p>Electrospun CP and CPA scaffolds were produced and they displayed fibrous, porous structures with fiber diameter ranging from 0.1 to 4.0 &#x003bc;m [<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>]. The electrospun fibers were morphologically similar to native extracellular matrix fibers and provided a large surface area to volume ratio, thereby promoting cell interactions and new tissue formation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] HDFs were shown to attach, migrate, and proliferate on the CP scaffold [<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">b</xref>] with enhanced cell proliferation, compared to PCL only scaffolds (data not shown). This finding suggested that the collagen polymer protruding on the surface of CP scaffolds enhanced surface hydrophobicity and resulted in favorable cell interaction, proliferation, and migration. SEM analysis of seeded fibroblasts at day 14 on CP scaffold revealed large numbers of attached cells in contact with the surface [<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>]. Pronounced flattening and spreading of cells was observed at days 7 and 14 [<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">b</xref>], obscuring the underlying polymer surface, with cellular processes connecting the flattened cell bodies. This behavior suggests strong cell adhesion with the underlying substrate via local contacts and provides a measure of the biocompatibility of the polymer. However, HDF penetration of the CP scaffolds was not observed due to either the small pore size in the range of 1.0-13.6 &#x003bc;m of the scaffolds, uneven distribution of collagen throughout the fibers, or the limited time available for cell ingrowth to occur. These findings are broadly in line with those of Powell <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] who found that collagen-PCL solution with more than 30% (w/v) PCL resulted in separation of the collagen and PCL phases within the fibers. The lack of uniformity may slow or impair cell attachment and migration, as the cells have to attach to a natural polymer domain and then a synthetic polymer domain. Furthermore, the harsh processes of CP electrospun fabrication could also reduce the effectiveness of collagen element in the CP composite for cell migration.</p><p>In the study, we explored the feasibility of making a bioactive scaffold, not only for drug delivery but also to improve the scaffold&#x02019;s functionality for better cell growth, migration, and accelerated wound healing. An important aspect of drug delivery is the stability and activity of the drug during formation and throughout the release period. Although electrospun scaffolds were used for controlled delivery of low-molecular-weight hydrophilic drugs, growth factors, and proteins, to retain a lasting activity of delivered factors has always been a challenge due to the harsh processes of fabrication.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] Compared to other protein factors such as EGF and FGF, the AR inhibitor, ASC-J9, is a chemically stable compound that could better survive the process and retain its activity. Under SEM, the CPA scaffolds displayed uniformly thinner fibers and relatively more porous structures, compared to CP scaffolds [<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>]. In comparison with CP fibers, fiber morphology by SEM analysis revealed that CPA fibers were thinner with much rougher fiber surface. The absence of obvious drug particles on the CPA fiber surface suggested that dispersed ASC-J9 was effectively coated by collagen-PCL polymers during fiber formation. The <italic>in vitro</italic> data demonstrated that CPA scaffolds enhanced faster cell proliferation and better cell&#x02014;matrix interaction over the time course of 28 days, with significantly increased overall cell numbers in the scaffolds post-cell seeding, particularly from day 7 onward. This demonstrated that the drug and scaffold were not cytotoxic to the cells. These findings reflected a highly efficient delivery and sustained release of active ASC-J9 from CPA scaffolds over 4 weeks, which was also evident by DAPI staining that revealed HDFs migrated through to the central region of the CPA scaffolds on day 7 and by day 14 post-cell seeding. The observation of gradually accelerated cell migration and distribution in CPA scaffolds was encouraging, as it proved the feasibility of utilizing CP electrospun scaffolds for incorporation and delivery of bioactive molecules to promote cellular activities including cell&#x02014;scaffold interaction, cell proliferation, and migration.</p><p>In our animal model, CPA scaffolds were superior to CP scaffolds in promoting wound healing. Significantly accelerated migration of epidermal migration and wound closure was associated with CPA-grafted wounds, with only a mild inflammatory response observed, when compared to CP scaffolds. The newly formed skin had a well-differentiated epidermis with multiple layers of keratinocytes and a vascularized neodermis, both important components for functional skin. Our <italic>in vivo</italic> findings together with the above <italic>in vitro</italic> data were in agreement with the previous studies which demonstrated that topical application of ASC-J9 cream on mice resulted in accelerated wound repair via increased fibroblast proliferation and keratinocyte migration following inhibition of AR function.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] In comparison to topical treatment using cream or gel, CP electrospun scaffolds could serve as a good delivery device for not only structural scaffolding but also sustained delivery of bioactive compounds or molecules with minimal burst release for more effective wound healing and re-epithelialization.</p><p>Taken together, accelerated fibroblast proliferation, re-epithelialization, and wound healing were associated with grafting CPA scaffolds. These results were achieved via the sustained release of ASC-J9 from CPA scaffolds into the wound area to promote cell proliferation and migration in addition to the structural support and guidance. More importantly, this study demonstrated the principle of using electrospun CP scaffolds for releasing drugs or active molecules into the wound. It could enable the tissue regenerative scaffold, with extra biofactors or cues, to speed up skin cell growth, migration, wound closure, and re-epithelialization. Future studies will focus on refining the process to improve the fabrication of CP scaffolds for delivering ASC-J9, and possibly multiple biofactors, as well as characterizing host - scaffold interactions including inflammation, cell recruitment, and synthesis of key proteins in relation to wound healing, skin regeneration, and scar development.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Chong C, Wang Y, Maitz PK, Simanainen U, Li Z.

Currently in the UK such opportunities are largely confined to GP waiting rooms.</p></sec><sec><title>Aim</title><p>To investigate the reasons why people do or do not use BP self-screening facilities.</p></sec><sec><title>Design and setting</title><p>A cross-sectional, qualitative study in Oxfordshire, UK.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p>Semi-structured interviews with members of the general public recruited using posters in GP surgeries and community locations were recorded, transcribed, and coded thematically.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of the 30 interviewees, 20% were hypertensive and almost half had self-screened. Those with no history of elevated readings had limited concern over their BP: self-screening filled the time waiting for their appointment or was done to help their doctor. Patients with hypertension self-screened to avoid the feelings they associated with &#x02018;white coat syndrome&#x02019; and to introduce more control into the measurement process. Barriers to self-screening included a lack of awareness, uncertainty about technique, and worries over measuring BP in a public place. An unanticipated finding was that several interviewees preferred monitoring their BP in the waiting room than at home.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>BP self-screening appeared acceptable to service users. Further promotion and education could increase awareness among non-users of the need for BP screening, the existence of self-screening facilities, and its ease of use. Waiting room monitors could provide an alternative for patients with hypertension who are unwilling or unable to monitor at home.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>hypertension</kwd><kwd>primary health care</kwd><kwd>qualitative research</kwd><kwd>screening</kwd><kwd>self-care</kwd><kwd>self-monitoring</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Blood pressure (BP) self-monitoring is an increasingly common and accepted activity for patients with hypertension, and is usually undertaken in the home.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Meta-analyses of trial data suggest that, after training and as part of an ongoing management plan, self-monitoring leads to clinically significant reductions in BP<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and improved medication adherence.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Qualitative studies describe how self-monitoring empowers patients, enabling them to better understand their condition,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> although patients need clinician support and education regarding how to interpret results and when to seek assistance.<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Some clinicians have also expressed concerns about the potential for bias by patients when reporting self-monitoring data,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and the accuracy of unsupervised measurements<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> taken on potentially uncalibrated monitors.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>BP self-screening whereby members of the public check their own BP using open-access monitors<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> is now possible with the development of easy-to-use, clinically validated automatic solid-cuff sphygmomanometers.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> This type of cuff does not require fitting by a healthcare professional (HCP) and therefore such monitors can be utilised by lay people following simple instructions without training or supervision. BP self-screening offers the opportunity for BP measurements to be made outside their traditional setting of healthcare consultations. It is estimated that BP self-screening kiosks in the US &#x02014; typically found in pharmacies and work sites &#x02014; are used over a million times a day.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> It has been suggested that the presence of self-screening stations reduces undiagnosed hypertension and improves treatment rates.<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>A recent systematic review<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> identified three studies of self-screening: a UK pilot study of BP monitors in community settings;<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> a Canadian study that extracted the data from BP self-screening kiosks in 341 pharmacies;<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and a study of self-screening kiosks in US pharmacies and grocery stores.<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Patient experience was investigated in the UK study only. Thirty structured interviews were undertaken with a randomly selected sample of patients who had self-screened a normotensive result. Of these, five (17%) preferred an HCP to measure their BP and 11 (37%) preferred to self-screen, primarily because of the improved convenience, with the remaining participants expressing no preference. Seven (23%) would have liked more privacy. The study did not report whether there were any differences in acceptability depending on the location of the self-screening equipment. Nor did it include people who had not screened.</p><p>In a linked study, it was found that the only BP self-screening opportunities routinely available to the general public in an English county were located in GP surgery waiting rooms.<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Such facilities are seen by primary care staff and GPs as a method of achieving BP screening performance targets and freeing up clinician time;<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> however, little is known about how they are viewed by members of the public.

Interviewees were recruited via posters displayed in three Oxfordshire GP surgeries with BP self-screening equipment, a library, and a community centre in Oxfordshire. An advert was also placed in an Oxford community newsletter and on their webpage. The posters and adverts invited adults (aged &#x02265;18 years) to contact the research team if they were willing to share their views and experiences, if any, of checking their BP in the community. The researcher then sent them a participant information sheet, consent form, and brief demographic survey for completion and return in a post-paid envelope if they were interested in participating. Recruitment continued until data saturation.<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Responders&#x02019; demographic details were monitored during recruitment to ensure a balance of ages, sexes, and self-screening experience. Interviewees were offered a &#x000a3;20 gift voucher as an acknowledgement of their time and reimbursed their travel expenses if attending the university for the interview.</p><p>An interview schedule was developed based on the study&#x02019;s objectives and refined after initial use. Topics covered included knowledge and attitudes towards BP, whether they had self-screened, and the process of BP self-screening and other types of BP measurement. Interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed, and checked for accuracy. NVivo (QSR International, version 9) was used to organise the transcripts and record the coding process. A coding framework was developed; initial coding was undertaken independently by two researchers. Codes used were refined using the constant comparison method.<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The One Sheet of Paper analysis method was used to compile all the issues raised for a single code and these were grouped to form themes.<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The themes that emerged could be grouped into barriers and facilitators.</p><p>All interviewees gave written, informed consent before participation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The planned sample size of 30 patients was interviewed: 15 (50%) were working, 14 (47%) were female, and six (20%) were hypertensive (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). It was felt that data saturation was achieved. Interviews were conducted on a 1:1 basis apart from a couple who requested to be interviewed together (BPSS111, BPSS112). For logistical reasons, one telephone interview and three interviews were conducted at interviewees&#x02019; homes rather than at the university. <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1">Box 1</xref> lists the abbreviations used to describe the interviewees.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Characteristics of interviewees, <italic>n</italic> = 30</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="middle" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold><italic>n</italic></bold></th><th valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>%</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BP self-screening service user</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">47</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1">

Another interviewee&#x02019;s GP noticed:

They self-screened to fill the time waiting for their appointment and to confirm their normotensive status. For patients with hypertension or those with a history of elevated results, the process was more considered. By self-screening, they gained control by deciding when they checked their BP and whether to disclose the results to their HCP.</p><p>Although BP self-screening removed the presence of an HCP, it introduced new anxieties associated with measuring BP in a public place, such as doubts about ability to use the equipment and about interpreting the results, which formed barriers to self-screening.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>To the authors&#x02019; knowledge this is the first qualitative study investigating patient reasons for using public BP self-screening facilities. A recent systematic review of hypertension detection identified few existing studies that addressed barriers to attending screening, possibly because of the difficulty of conducting population-based research rather than using the &#x02018;captive&#x02019; populations within hypertension clinics.<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>Although the predominantly white sample reflects the ethnic make-up of Oxfordshire,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> it limits the generalisability of the study findings to more diverse settings. Public BP measurement &#x02014; including the removal of outer clothing &#x02014; may be less acceptable in other cultural groups: the BP-Eth study, conducted in Birmingham (UK), found that people of South Asian and African Caribbean ethnic groups rated BP monitoring to be less acceptable than white English people.<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> This included ambulatory, office, and self-monitoring measurements, although the acceptability of measurements taken in the waiting room was not studied.</p><p>The present sample included six self-reported patients with hypertension and several more who described themselves as borderline. No interviewee had their first experience of an elevated reading using the waiting room monitor, however, and therefore future studies could explore the experience of self-screening triggering a change in BP status and the impact of not having an HCP present at this time.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with existing literature</title><p>BP self-screening users accepted measurements taken in the waiting room as accurate, with some believing them to be superior to home readings, or free from the WCE. Although the diagnostic and prognostic accuracy of home BP measurements<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and the phenomenon of the WCE<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> are well characterised, the present authors are aware of only one study examining the accuracy of BP measured in a waiting room.<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> That study found such measures were comparable with the &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019; of ambulatory BP measurements, but the results are of limited comparability with those of the current work as the previous study used a BpTRU device not a solid-cuff monitor that had been specifically designed for waiting room use. Another trial showed that regular use of self-monitoring in the waiting room led to lower BP, at least in the short term.<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><p>Those who rarely attended their surgery or were less engaged with their health were unaware of the availability of open-access BP monitors in their GP surgery. Several male interviewees expressed reluctance to attend their surgery. GP consultation rates are known to be higher in females than males, significantly so in younger adulthood (15&#x02013;44 years).<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Meanwhile, national surveys have shown that, in those aged &#x0003c;70 years, hypertension is more prevalent in males than females,<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> suggesting a mismatch between the need for screening and accessibility of waiting room BP monitors, which may have little promotion outside the GP practice.<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Some interviewees felt that self-screening was unnecessary as they would sense if their BP was elevated. The perceived symptomatic nature of hypertension has been reported elsewhere, as has the close link between elevated BP and stress.<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Among clinicians, BP is an accepted measure of cardiovascular health, but patients may be using self-screening to monitor other parameters of their wellbeing such as their stress levels. The present findings also concur with a systematic review that concluded a lack of knowledge regarding the importance of BP screening and the potential consequences of hypertension were the most common barriers to hypertension detection.<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>The present finding that some patients preferred to monitor their BP in the waiting room rather than in their own homes was unanticipated, partly because of the reduced convenience. This contrasts with an earlier survey of BP self-monitoring trial participants who preferred to monitor at home rather than in the waiting room.<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> This variation in findings may result from differences between samples and, in practice, one mode of BP monitoring may not suit everyone.</p><p>Unlike BP measurements taken during consultations, self-screening introduces the opportunity for non-disclosure of results by patients to their HCPs. A similar phenomenon has also been observed in patients self-monitoring their BP at home.<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Qualitative research found that this was because of perceived lack of interest from the clinician and fear of being prescribed additional medication.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Using a waiting room monitor placed there by the HCPs may diminish the former reason for non-disclosure but HCPs should be aware that their patients may be checking their own BP in the waiting room and not telling them.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Implications for research and practice</title><p>The present results suggest that general practices with BP monitors located in the waiting room may wish to consider the methods by which they promote their presence to patient groups who rarely attend primary care and/or infrequently have their BP measured. They should also reflect on their physical location within the practice to maximise acceptability to patients. Healthcare professionals should also be aware that patients may not report self-screened results unless they are directly asked or there is a clearly signposted system in place to encourage them to submit them for review.</p><p>Central to consolidating the role of waiting room monitors in primary care BP screening and hypertension management is confirming their utility. Monitors such as those in most waiting rooms have been clinically validated but no data currently exist to show that such equipment can lead to better rates of diagnosis or control.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Waiting room monitors could then offer a halfway house for patients unwilling or unable to monitor at home and play a role in diagnostic and management pathways. Future research could evaluate interventions that seek to promote the use of BP self-screening monitors in clinics.</p><p>Given the finding that patients screen themselves to confirm their normotensive status, it would be helpful to investigate the impact of elevated self-screened results without an HCP on hand, perhaps using a &#x02018;think aloud&#x02019; technique,<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> in particular to better understand if and when patients decide to disclose such a result. This information would help to better characterise the utility of self-screening as a tool to reduce the burden of untreated hypertension, and the potential for community-based self-screening programmes.</p><p>The process of self-screening in the waiting room was generally well liked by service users. It is not currently accessed by all eligible patients, however, because of a lack of awareness about its existence or the perceived stigma of being seen (attempting) to measure BP. Several questions must be answered about BP self-screening in the relatively controlled environment of the waiting room before community BP self-screening should be considered, especially in the face of the limited public demand reported in this study.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>Many thanks to the study participants and to the GP practices and community venues that displayed recruitment posters.</p></ack><notes><sec><title>Funding</title><p>The views expressed are those of the author(s) and not necessarily those of the NHS, the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), or the Department of Health.

procedure and persisting for more than 2 months without other apparent causes such
as infection or the underlying disease that motivated the surgery<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The concept of CPOP was first proposed by Crombie, in 1998<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>; thereafter, various studies
have been performed in an attempt to identify, define, quantify, and stratify the
associated factors leading to CPOP. Median sternotomy is the most widely used
approach in cardiac surgery and, despite all the advances in this field, a large
number of patients report postoperative chest pain. The incidence of chronic
post-sternotomy pain (CPSP) varies between 17% and 56%<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>-<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>; in approximately one-third
of these patients, CPSP can compromise quality of life, affecting their sleep
patterns and impairing their working ability<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In addition to the diverse characteristics of pain in the various body tissues,
sensitivity to pain varies between individuals depending on age, gender, and the
underlying disease itself<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. Other psychosocial factors such as depression, anxiety,
low education level and fear of surgery are established risk factors for
CPOP<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>,<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Even though CPOP is frequently regarded as expected or irrelevant, it should be seen
as a major clinical - and even social - issue. Chronic pain is often responsible for
delayed return to work, which entails greater burden on the public health system and
social security.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to determine some factors associated with CPSP in
patients who underwent cardiac surgery at the Santa Casa de Miseric&#x000f3;rdia
Hospital in Ponta Grossa, Paran&#x000e1;, Brazil.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>After approval by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Universidade Estadual de
Ponta Grossa (Ponta Grossa State University) under Formal Opinion 159.531, we
performed an observational analytical case-control study to examine the influence of
a number of factors on the development of CPSP following heart surgery.</p><sec><title>Patients</title><p>We evaluated 453 consecutive patients with more than 6 months post-sternotomy for
cardiac surgery assisted at the Heart Surgery and Cardiology Outpatient Clinic
and private practice office of the Heart Surgery Service of the Santa Casa de
Miseric&#x000f3;rdia Hospital of Ponta Grossa in the years 2013 through 2014. The
time from surgery to evaluation ranged from 6 to 279 months, mean 58 months. All
of these patients agreed to complete a pain questionnaire. Clinical and surgical
data were complemented with data from the patients' medical records. Patients
were included if they had undergone valve surgery, coronary artery bypass
surgery, interatrial communication closure, aortic surgery, left ventricle
aneurysm repair, myxoma resection or combined procedures in which sternotomy was
the selected approach to the thoracic cavity.</p></sec><sec><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Patients with less than 6 months of surgery and patients with connective tissue
disorders were excluded. There weren't other exclusion criteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Variables</title><p>The patients were inquired with respect to the presence of chest pain, its
characteristics, and intensity ranging from 1 to 10. For the aim of our study,
only the binary variable "presence or absence of pain" was taken into account.
Chronic pain was defined as new-onset pain that arose postoperatively,
persisting for more than 6 months after the surgery. Macrae<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> defined CPOP as pain
originated after a surgical procedure and lasting at least 2 months. In the
present study, as a factor of safety, we only included patients with a
postoperative period &#x0003e; 6 months. Any sternal or anterior chest pain,
regardless of its intensity, was taken into account and provided that the pain
was present at the time of evaluation.</p><p>The patients were allocated into a group with chronic pain and a control group
without pain (dependent variable). The following independent variables were
included in the Cox regression model: (a) age; (b) gender; (c) foreign descent
(patients whose parents were not born in Brazil. There are a lot of European
descents in the study and it was intended to assess whether this population has
different sensitivity to pain); (d) use of internal thoracic artery (ITA) grafts
in coronary artery bypass surgery; (e) depression or anxiety that needed use of
antidepressant medication at any point in time for treatment to exclude any
minor episode of depression or anxiety that did not need use of medications; (f)
diabetes mellitus (only patients who were in treatment for diabetes at the time
of evaluation); (g) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) clinically
confirmed by patient history, physical examination, and use of COPD medication;
(h) systemic arterial hypertension (SAH) (only patients in antihypertensive
treatment at the time of evaluation; (i) hypothyroidism (patients with confirmed
disease by TSH level and on thyroid hormone replacement therapy); (j)
dyslipidemia (patients with history of dyslipidemia and using lipid-lowering
agents); (k) surgical wound complication (resolved superficial wound infection,
cured mediastinitis, keloid formation, or dehiscence of healed wound), and (l)
patient on disability benefits or scheduled for a consultative medical
examination for retirement purposes.</p><p>The clinical criteria were based on history, laboratorial exams and disease
treatment, since the patients were receiving optimized medical treatment and in
the late postoperative period with multiple medications.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The data were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards model. The Cox model
makes it possible to determine which independent variables have an intensifying
effect when analyzed as a set, and computes their statistical significance
within a confidence interval (CI) 95%. Thus, we were able to estimate the hazard
ratio (HR) of each of these variables. Values of <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 were
considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>We evaluated 453 patients; 178 (39.29%) of these had CPSP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). The prevalence of factors related to the event of CPSP

sample, which showed an incidence rate of 39.29%.</p><p>An extensive review of the literature allowed us to conclude that the present study
involved the world's largest number of published cases of patients interviewed
face-to-face in CPSP research.</p><p>In our study, 67.4% of the patients with CPSP had received an ITA graft. Mailis et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>
described the association between postoperative thoracic pain and the use of ITA
grafts in myocardial revascularization and indicated the possibility of a pain
syndrome resulting from the use of that artery. This finding prompted studies aimed
at proving the source of the pain. Eng &#x00026; Wells<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> reported that the use of ITA grafts resulted
in a high incidence of CPSP compared with venous grafts in revascularization
surgeries. Thus, the use of ITA coronary grafts emerged as one of the risk factors
for chronic pain. This finding corroborates those of Alston &#x00026;
Pechon<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>,
who affirmed that damage to the intercostal nerves could occur in the dissection of
the ITA bed using diathermy.</p><p>Intraoperative nerve injury is a major cause of pain manifest postoperatively as
hyperalgesia and allodynia, both typical symptoms of neuropathic
pain<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>.
Van Gulik et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>, in a prospective cohort study with 146 patients who
underwent heart surgery by sternotomy, found that 54.8% of the patients with CPSP
had received ITA revascularization (OR=1.27; 95% CI, 0.60-2.70), values that are
close to those of our study (67.4 %; HR=1.39; 95% CI, 1.08-1.80). Because OR and HR
are effect size measures, both resulting from a regression study, OR and HR values
are comparable.</p><p>The proportional hazards regression of Cox made it possible to demonstrate the
relationship between CPSP and depression or anxiety disorder. Romano &#x00026;
Turner<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>
performed a study that provided evidence of the association of chronic pain with
depression. Ohayon &#x00026; Schatzberg<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>, in a 2010 study with 3243 patients, informed that
66.3% of the patients with depression reported chronic pain in the most diverse
locations. In the present study, 65.2% of the patients with CPSP had depression or
anxiety disorder. If analyzed separately, 59.4% among the patients diagnosed with
depression or anxiety disorder had chronic pain, which is close to the percentage
found in the Ohayon &#x00026; Schatzberg<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> study. Nevertheless, data are still lacking in the
literature correlating CPSP to depression or anxiety disorder.</p><p>The origin of this type of pain can be explained by a number of theories, with
depression or anxiety disorder and pain being related on the most diverse levels,
such as the psychological, behavioral, and neurobiological. Neurotransmitters such
as serotonin and noradrenaline, both implicated in depressive or anxiety disorders,
act on the neurobiological level and play an important role in the modulation of
pain. Osterweis et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> stated that, on account of the action of
neurotransmitters, pain conduction can in fact be altered by depression in the same
way as a nociceptive impulse is capable of inducing or exacerbating a given mood. It
has been hypothesized that, psychologically, chronic pain is a particular form of
somatization in which negative emotions are expressed through physical complaints -
including pain. Somatosensory amplification is a related concept that has been
defined as a person's increased propensity to feel and express pain. Based on the
explanation for these complex mechanisms, Von Korff &#x00026; Simon.<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> were able to prove the
relationship between pain and depression, which was also found in the present study
sample.</p><p>About dyslipidemia, all of the patients were using statin. Although statin can cause
muscle pain there wasn't statistical differences in this variable. Hypothyroidism
was also more common in the group of patients with CPSP. Many reports can be found
in the literature concerning thyroid hormones and their functions; however, studies
of their connection with pain are scarce. The thyroid gland has a prominent role in
tissue metabolism and development; in addition, the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid
axis is central to the modulation and neurotransmission processes in the central
nervous system<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Aloisi et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>, in
a pilot study with a group of 200 women with chronic pain - whose medical history
was investigated - found that 19% of them had some degree of thyroid dysfunction.
That rate is similar to the overall value of 16.3% found in our analysis.</p><p>Despite the number of existing studies, the hypothesized relationship between
hypothyroidism and chronic pain is still far from understood. The origin of pain
could be neuropathic; this is one of the key points to be elucidated, as neuropathic
pain is prominent in somatosensory system injury<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>. Aminoglycan deposits surrounding nerves,
primary axonal degeneration, and segmental demyelination mechanisms have been
proposed for the peripheral nerve dysfunction in hypothyroidism, as demonstrated in
rodents<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>.
Another piece of evidence is the low oxygen consumption and high blood pressure
frequently found among hypothyroid individuals, leading to regional hypoxia and
eventually to muscle spasms due to the inadequate supply of blood and nutrients for
the muscles<sup>[<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>.
This could explain some of the mechanisms involving hypothyroidism and pain.</p><p>As evidenced by Cox regression, sternal surgical wound complications are associated
with the outcome under study. Sternal wound complications increase the risk of CPSP,
ranging from superficial infections to sternal instability and
mediastinitis<sup>[<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>. Marques et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> pointed out that although wound
complications following sternotomy are rare, infection is a threatening occurrence
because it could extend to other areas, thus causing future complications.</p><p>Einsenberg et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>
suggested that sternal surgical wound infection is one of the likely causes of CPSP.
This had already been indicated by Ottino et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> in 1987. Although there are reports on the
relationship between surgical wound complications and chronic pain, concrete data to
evidence this association were still lacking.</p><p>Another risk factor for CPSP was identified in the patients who were receiving
disability benefits or were scheduled for a consultative medical examination to
apply for early retirement by the National Social Security Institute. Although no
reports can be found in the literature addressing this specific variable and its
relationship to CPSP, similar studies have been developed. In 1995, Rosomoff et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup>
studied the relationship between the perception of chronic pain by patients who
derived some form of secondary gain from their complaint of pain and those who did
not have such gain. Even though those authors suggested that there could be a link
between altered perception of pain and the benefits obtained, they also stated that
they were not able to demonstrate a difference between the group receiving benefits
and the group without benefits.</p><p>Along these lines, Vaccaro et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup>, in a 1997 retrospective study with 24 patients who
had chronic low back pain, found that 11 out of the 13 patients who had applied for
worker's compensation showed poor outcomes in the management of their chronic pain
while 9 of the 11 patients in the group of non-claimants had excellent results.
Those authors concluded that although the sample size was small and the study was
retrospective, worker's compensation and litigation claims were strongly associated
with worse outcomes in the management of chronic pain.</p><p>Our clinical experience shows that the patients who have not yet retired and are not
working complain of chronic pain more often, which was evidenced in the present case
population. Psychological and behavioral mechanisms may be implicated in the
enhanced pain of patients who expect to be granted social security benefits or who
fear losing those benefits, since these beneficiaries have to undergo frequent
consultative medical exams for years. On the other hand, given that patients with
pain are more likely to seek disability benefits, CPSP may be either the cause or
the effect in the case of patients on disability benefits.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In the case patients of the present study, the factors associated with increased
incidence of chronic post-sternotomy pain were: (a) use of ITA grafts; (b) history
of depression or anxiety that needed use of antidepressant medication; (c)
hypothyroidism; (d) surgical wound complications, and (e) patients on disability
benefits or scheduled for a consultative examination.</p><table-wrap id="t5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-top-style:solid"><th colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1">

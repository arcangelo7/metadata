Presence of respiratory symptoms was determined from self-report of chronic productive cough and breathlessness assessed using the British Medical Research Council (MRC) breathlessness scale. Self-reported physical and mental health were measured using the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12). Hypertension was assessed from mean blood pressure measured at the health check and/or self-reported use of antihypertensive medication. Other comorbidities were assessed from self-report. Logistic regression models were fitted assessing the association between respiratory symptoms and comorbidities. Linear regression models were fitted to investigate the association between respiratory symptoms and self-reported health scores. All models were adjusted for age, education and smoking status.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The age-standardised prevalence of cough and breathlessness was 20.9% (prevalence with breathlessness MRC grade 3 or above 3.7%). The majority of men with respiratory symptoms (87.3%) were current smokers. Cough and breathlessness were associated with substantially worse self-reported physical and mental health (test for trend with severity of breathlessness p&#x0003c;0.001). Those with chronic cough and grade 3 or above breathlessness had higher odds of having hypertension (OR 3.03; 95% CI 1.36 to 6.74), diabetes (OR 10.55; 95% CI 2.69 to 41.37), angina pectoris (OR 7.54; 95% CI 3.61 to 15.73), previous myocardial infarction (OR 7.61; 95% CI 2.10 to 27.4) and previous stroke (OR 6.61; 95% CI 1.75 to 23.34) compared with those without respiratory symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The prevalence of respiratory symptoms was high.

This was a follow-up study of 1941 men living in Izhevsk originally recruited as population controls in a case&#x02013;control study of the association between hazardous alcohol consumption and premature mortality in 2003&#x02013;2006.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The original controls were living men frequency matched by age to cases (men aged 25&#x02013;54&#x02005;years who had died in the past year) selected at random from the population list of Izhevsk in 2002. In IFS-2 (2008&#x02013;2010), 1515 of these men were followed up, interviewed by a trained interviewer and invited to attend a health check. The health check conducted by a doctor included questions on medical history, three measurements of blood pressure and collection of a blood sample. There were four different doctors who conducted the health check. Participants were also given a self-completed questionnaire which included the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) questions.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> For the majority of men, the health check took place in a polyclinic, but those who were unable to attend the clinic were offered the option of having this done in their own home.</p><p>Out of the 1515/2041 men successfully reinterviewed as part of the IFS-2 study, 1052 attended the health check. For the purposes of this study, the sample was restricted to 983 men, with complete data collected on self-reported respiratory symptoms.

The impact of this was assessed in sensitivity analyses.</p><p>Chronic productive cough was defined by one positive answer to the following questions: &#x02018;Do you usually cough up any phlegm from your chest first thing in morning in winter?&#x02019;, and/or &#x02018;Do you usually cough up any phlegm from your chest, during the day or at night in winter?&#x02019;, and/or &#x02018;Do you bring up phlegm like this on most days for as much as 3&#x02005;months each year?&#x02019;.</p><p>Breathlessness was defined as a positive answer to one or more of the questions: (1) &#x02018;Are you troubled by shortness of breath when hurrying on level ground or walking up a slight hill?&#x02019;, and/or (2) &#x02018;Do you get short of breath walking with people of your own age group on level ground?&#x02019;, and/or (3) &#x02018;Do you have to stop for breath when walking at your own pace on level ground?&#x02019;, and/or (4) &#x02018;Have you had attacks of wheezing or whistling in your chest at any time in the last 12&#x02005;months?&#x02019;, and/or (5) &#x02018;Have you at any time in the past 12&#x02005;months been woken at night by an attack of shortness of breath?&#x02019;.</p><p>Breathlessness questions 1, 2 and 3 are part of the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) breathlessness scale, a validated tool for measuring disability associated with breathlessness,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and were used to further divide men with respiratory symptoms into those with breathlessness grade 2 or less, and those with breathlessness grade 3 or higher.

Quantity of alcohol consumed was measured using total volume of ethanol consumed in the past year calculated from questions on the frequency and usual quantity of beer, wine and spirits consumed. Using an approach developed in our previous work, men were also classified as non-drinkers, non-hazardous drinkers and hazardous drinkers.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Men were classified as hazardous drinkers if they reported twice weekly or more frequency of hangover and/or excessive drunkenness and/or sleeping in clothes at night because of drunkenness and/or failing their family or personal obligations because of drinking and/or drinking non-beverage alcohols (sources of ethanol not intended for drinking such as eau de cologne) and/or one or more episodes of zapoi (a period of 2 or more days of drinking during which a participant is withdrawn from normal social life).</p></sec><sec id="s2d5"><title>Medication use</title><p>Men were asked to report all medications they were taking at the time of the health check coded by a cardiologist. Use of medication for a respiratory problem was assessed by self-reported use of medications classified as bronchodilators, glucocorticoids and mucolytics.

Models were adjusted for age and education as a priori confounders and then additionally for smoking status. Smoking was considered as a potential confounder because it is strongly associated with both respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. However, smoking status could also be affected by both respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and as people may stop smoking due to illness, adjustment could also lead to spurious associations due to reverse causality. Models were, therefore, considered with and without adjustment for smoking status. Although alcohol consumption was considered a priori as a potential confounder, no strong associations were found between the two different measures of alcohol use and respiratory symptoms in univariate analysis; therefore, alcohol consumption was not included as a confounder in the final model.</p><p>The associations between self-reported physical and mental health components of the SF-12 and serum lipids (total cholesterol, HDL-C and triglycerides), BNP and BMI were assessed using linear regression models with self-reported respiratory symptoms as exposure variables.

There was strong evidence of an association between self-reported symptoms of chronic cough and breathlessness and education. The proportion of men with higher education decreased as severity of breathlessness increased. Different patterns emerged for the two measures of alcohol use: total volume consumed was highest among men with chronic cough and MRC breathlessness of grade 2 or less, but lowest among men with chronic cough and MRC breathlessness grade 3 or less. Conversely, the proportion of hazardous drinkers in the sample increased with severity of breathlessness. However, there was only weak evidence for an association with either measure of alcohol use and self-reported symptoms of chronic cough and breathlessness.</p><table-wrap id="BMJRESP2015000104TB2"

The substantive associations between self-reported cough and breathlessness and the other health outcomes were not altered under either scenario with the exception that in both the sensitivity analyses, no associations were seen between self-reported respiratory symptoms and total cholesterol (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this sample of working-age men living in the industrial city of Izhevsk, the age-standardised prevalence of self-reported symptoms of chronic cough and breathlessness was 20.9% (age-standardised prevalence of chronic cough with grade 3 or above breathlessness was 3.7%). The prevalence of chronic cough was 44.0% and breathlessness grade 2 or above was 33.9%. This is high compared with a prevalence of self-reported cough and/or breathlessness from the BREATHE study of 12.2% among 31&#x02005;418 men living in 11 countries in the Middle East and North Africa.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> The prevalence of cough and breathlessness among men in Izhvesk was higher than for any of the countries included in the BREATHE study (range 6.1% in the United Arab Emirates to15.9% in Pakistan). Chronic cough and breathlessness are both symptoms of COPD and the high prevalence of these symptoms suggests prevalence of COPD is likely to be high in this population. This is consistent with the one previous study which has investigated prevalence of COPD in Russia using spirometry; the study estimated overall prevalence in both men and women of 15.3%<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> compared with an international prevalence of 10.1% in the BOLD study (11.8% in men).<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Further studies in Russia using spirometry are needed to provide more reliable estimates of the burden of COPD.</p><p>In this study, self-reported symptoms of cough and breathlessness were associated with poorer self-reported physical and mental health as assessed by the SF-12. There was a particularly strong association with physical health; men with chronic cough and grade 3 breathlessness or above had a physical health score 11.6 points (95% CI 9.3 to 13.8) lower than men without any respiratory symptoms, indicating the severe impact of impaired respiratory function on quality of life for these men. Men with chronic cough and grade 3 or above breathlessness also had much higher odds of several comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, angina pectoris, MI and stroke) compared with men without respiratory symptoms, even after adjusting for smoking status. These strong associations are consistent with the findings from other countries that respiratory diseases, in particular COPD, are associated with substantial cardiovascular morbidity.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;13</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;20</xref> The association between respiratory symptoms and cardiovascular morbidity has not been investigated previously in Russia. The strong associations with other health conditions found in this study have implications for management of patients with respiratory symptoms; these patients could benefit from identification and treatment of comorbidities. Along with increased odds of cardiovascular comorbidities, men in Izhvesk with respiratory symptoms also had on average a worse cardiovascular risk profile with higher BMI and lower HDL-C levels; however, total cholesterol was also lower and no association was found with triglycerides. There was also strong evidence of higher levels of BNP with respiratory symptoms. Some of this association may be due to misclassification of heart failure as a respiratory problem in this study since breathlessness is a symptom of both; however, this finding is consistent with previous studies which have found both higher levels of BNP among patients with COPD compared with healthy controls<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> and that heart failure is a common comorbidity among those with COPD.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> There were only weak associations found in this study between alcohol consumption and respiratory symptoms despite strong associations between hazardous alcohol consumption and blood pressure, cardiovascular disease and BNP.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40&#x02013;43</xref> Given the very high levels of cardiovascular mortality in Russia, the identification of patients with respiratory problems as a potentially high-risk group who may benefit from primary and secondary prevention could be particularly important. Conversely, respiratory function should also be investigated among those with cardiovascular disease.</p><p>In this study the majority of men (87.3%) who reported respiratory symptoms continued to smoke. This was the case even for men experiencing more severe breathlessness (81.6% current smokers). Smoking cessation is a key part of treatment for many respiratory conditions. This is the single most effective treatment for COPD with an important role in slowing the disease progression.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> An estimated 62% of patients with COPD in the UK are current smokers estimated from a random sample of patients with COPD in the UK population registered with general practitioner practices in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Although not directly comparable, the findings from Izhvesk are consistent with findings from this study and studies in clinical populations that a large proportion of those with COPD continue to smoke despite their disease.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Smoking cessation treatment has been found to be effective for reducing smoking in patients with COPD<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46&#x02013;49</xref> and should be offered routinely to those reporting respiratory symptoms.</p><p>There were several limitations to this study. First spirometry was not carried out at the health check. Self-reported symptoms of cough and breathlessness were used here to make some inference about chronic respiratory disease burden overall and its associations with cardiovascular comorbidities in this population. We would like to use these findings to make some inferences particularly about COPD, but this should be done with caution given that the case definition used here is less specific than COPD as determined by spirometry, and that some men with cough and breathlessness in this study may have had other lung conditions such as asthma or tuberculosis. In addition, all comorbidities were also self-reported which is an additional source of measurement error. A further limitation in considering the prevalence estimates is that the study population was a small subset of men aged 25&#x02013;59&#x02005;years living in the city of Izhevsk; therefore, the results on prevalence are not generalisable to women, older men or to men living elsewhere in Russia and estimates of prevalence are likely to be imprecise. However, the finding that prevalence of chronic cough and breathlessness is high is consistent with findings from other studies in Russia.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> There may also have been some selection bias in the study since only 65% of men interviewed at IFS-2 went on to attend the health check. However, no differences were found between men included in this study and all men taking part in IFS-2.</p><p>A further limitation was that no data were collected about clinical diagnoses and data collected on treatment were limited. Men were asked about what medications they were taking. However, this question did not refer specifically to inhalers and it is possible many men did not report these. Only 10 men reported the use of bronchodilators in the sample overall, but it is not possible to disentangle whether this is due to very low levels of treatment with bronchodilators or under-reporting of use of these medications. There seems to be a very low level of use of bronchodilators given that some men are likely to have been prescribed bronchodilators for asthma, though it is worth noting that bronchodilators could be expensive for a substantial proportion of the population as Russian patients need to pay the full cost of their medications. It was, however, possible to look at the prevalence of smoking cessation, an important aspect of treatment for respiratory disease. The high proportion of current smokers with respiratory symptoms supports findings from medication data that treatment levels in this population are low. Finally there was a low prevalence of several of the comorbidities included, in particular stroke, diabetes and MI; therefore, results are based on small numbers and a limited number of potential confounders were included. Despite these limitations, the finding of a high level of self-reported chronic cough and breathlessness in this study is important given the very limited data available on the burden of chronic respiratory conditions in the Russian Federation.</p><p>In conclusion, in this sample of working-age men living in Izhevsk, the prevalence of chronic cough and breathlessness was high and associated with worse self-reported physical and mental health and higher levels of cardiovascular comorbidities. Despite the importance of smoking cessation in treatment for respiratory diseases, the majority of men with chronic cough and breathlessness in this population continued to smoke, thus showing that this is not being tackled sufficiently. Chronic respiratory disease is an important public health issue for Russia, but the low levels of research published suggest this is a neglected area. More research is needed, specifically around the levels of diagnosis and treatment in Russia. The association between respiratory symptoms and cardiovascular comorbidity is of particular importance given the extremely high levels of cardiovascular mortality in Russia.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Vladimir Shkolnikov and Arytom Gil for reviewing a draft of this paper.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> SC and JKQ conceived the idea for this paper.

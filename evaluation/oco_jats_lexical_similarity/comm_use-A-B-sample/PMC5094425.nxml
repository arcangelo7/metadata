country. Reperfusion, although essential, is considered a factor of clinical
deterioration of the patient due to the formation of toxic reactive oxygen species,
promoting cell injury, bacterial translocation and systemic inflammatory response,
with no effective treatment at this time<sup>[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Although intestinal ischemia accounts for only 800 in 100,000 admissions<sup>[<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>, it has high mortality rates,
ranging from 60% to 100%<sup>[<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>, due to
local lesions and distance, and it may occur as a result of multiple organ
dysfunction. In this case, the liver is a major organ involved, thus its study in
this process becomes relevant<sup>[<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Aiming to address the various situations of ischemia avoiding reperfusion lesions, a
large number of substances and procedures have been studied, including its remote
and local effects. Some of the published proposals obtained good experimental
results, but without proven success in clinical practice<sup>[<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In 2003, Zhao et al.<sup>[<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> proposed an
alternative treatment of ischemia and reperfusion (I/R), ischemic postconditioning
(IPC), which consists of performing one or more cycles of reperfusion followed by
one or more cycles of ischemia, before the reperfusion phase, demonstrating a
protective effect on myocardial ischemia in animals.</p><p>In mesenteric I/R, IPC was initially assessed by Santos et al.<sup>[<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>, who also observed its
effectiveness in this process, which was subsequently verified and published by
other authors. However, there are no studies assessing IPC's ability to reduce liver
damage in mesenteric I/R, making it necessary to carry out further studies to define
its role in this condition.</p><p>The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of IPC in preventing reperfusion
injury in the liver of rats subjected to mesenteric I/R by comparing two different
methods of IPC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Federal University of Mato
Grosso do Sul. All ethical rules established by the Brazilian College of Animal
Experimentation were followed.</p><p>Thirty rats (<italic>Rattus norvegicus albinos,</italic> Rodentia, Mammalia), Wistar
male adult, were obtained from the vivarium of the Federal University of Mato Grosso
do Sul and divided into three groups:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Group A - I/R: comprised of ten rats subjected to intestinal ischemia by
occlusion of the cranial mesenteric artery with a vascular clamp for 30
minutes, followed by reperfusion for 60 minutes.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Group B - IPC 1: comprised of ten rats subjected to ischemia by occlusion of
the cranial mesenteric artery with a vascular clamp for 30 minutes and
reperfusion for 60 minutes. Between ischemia and reperfusion, two
reperfusion cycles (two minutes each) interleaved with two ischemia cycles
(two minutes each) were performed.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Group C - IPC 2: comprised of ten rats subjected to ischemia by occlusion of
the cranial mesenteric artery with a vascular clamp for 30 minutes and
reperfusion for 60 minutes. Between ischemia and reperfusion, four
reperfusion cycles (30 seconds each) interspersed with four cycles of
ischemia (30 seconds each) were performed.</p></list-item></list><p>The animals were weighed on an electronic scale and anesthetized by intraperitoneal
injection of 2:1 solution of 50 mg/mL ketamine hydrochloride
(Cetamin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>), and 20 mg/mL xylazine
(Xilazin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>), at a dose of 0.1 mL/100g.</p><p>The rats were maintained under spontaneous ventilation throughout the procedure.
Median longitudinal laparotomy of about four centimeters, externalization of the
small intestine, as well as identification and dissection of the cranial mesenteric
artery were performed.</p><p>In group A, the cranial mesenteric artery was occluded by atraumatic vascular clamp
for 30 minutes (ischemia phase). After placing the clamp, the small intestine was
repositioned in the abdominal cavity and the wound was closed with continuous suture
of the skin with nylon monofilament 4-0 (mononylon<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>). After the
ischemia phase, the abdominal wall was opened again by removing the suture and the
vascular clamp was removed, beginning the reperfusion phase, which lasted 60
minutes. In all three groups, reperfusion was initiated, the abdomen was closed once
again by continuous suture of the skin with nylon monofilament 4-0 until the end of
the experiment.</p><p>In group B, 30 minutes of ischemia and 60 minutes of reperfusion were carried out.
Preceding the reperfusion, IPC was performed, by carrying out two reperfusion cycles
(removal of atraumatic vascular clamp of the cranial mesenteric artery), lasting two
minutes each, interspersed with two ischemia cycles (occlusion of the cranial
mesenteric artery by atraumatic vascular clamp), also lasting two minutes each.</p><p>In group C, 30 minutes of ischemia and 60 minutes of reperfusion were carried out.
Preceding the reperfusion, IPC was performed, by carrying out four reperfusion
cycles (removal of atraumatic vascular clamp of the cranial mesenteric artery),
lasting 30 seconds each, interspersed with four ischemia cycles (occlusion of the
cranial mesenteric artery by atraumatic vascular clamp), also lasting 30 seconds
each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p><fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Schematic demonstration of time used for ischemia and reperfusion in

</p><p>After reperfusion, in the three groups, the abdominal wall was opened again by
removing the suture and the left lobe of the liver was resected, washed with saline
and placed in a 10% solution of formaldehyde for subsequent histological analysis.
The animals were euthanized by increasing the anesthesia level.</p><p>After fixation in 10% formaldehyde solution, the resected liver segments were
submitted to histological processing. The slides were stained with hematoxylin-eosin
and analyzed in optical microscope by a pathologist without prior knowledge of the
group each rat belonged to, who then ranked them according to the degree of tissue
injury. To this end, the following rating was used, according to prior publication
of Takeda et al.<sup>[<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>: Grade 0 - no
histological changes; Grade 1 - centrilobular congestion; grade 2 - centrilobular
congestion with some degeneration of hepatocytes in one or two central veins; and
grade 3 -multifocal centrilobular congestion and degeneration of portal
hepatocytes.</p><p>The results were analyzed statistically using ANOVA variance test, and were

duration, and many of the resulting injuries are developed during the tissue
reoxygenation stage. One of the organic mechanisms of greater impact for cell
homeostasis is oxidative stress and the production of free radicals, resulting from
two major pathophysiological events: ischemia followed by reperfusion and the
inflammatory process culminating with local and/or systemic changes<sup>[<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Mesenteric ischemia is one of the most serious diseases of the gastrointestinal tract
and, depending on its development time, the process can evolve to necrosis when
blood flow is restored, aggravating the damage occurred in the ischemic phase.
Injury to the intestinal mucosa from I/R is well known, but little is known about
the involvement of the digestive tract portions, the focus distance of the primary
lesion, even though remote injury has been extensively documented in other
situations of I/R<sup>[<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Seifi et al.<sup>[<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> evaluated the
protective effect of IPC on liver damage after kidney I/R. Rats underwent renal
ischemia for 45 minutes and IPC was carried out in four cycles of I/R, each with a
10-second duration. It was observed that the kidney I/R caused a significant
increase in liver function indices, such as increased transaminases. On the other
hand, those parameters were significantly reduced in the IPC group, showing induced
reduction of malondialdehyde levels in the liver and increased superoxide dismutase
activity. In this study, although the organ subjected to I/R was the liver, carrying
out a larger number of shorter cycles in the same IPC was not more efficient than
performing a smaller number of cycles of longer duration.</p><p>In the evaluation of IPC in aortic I/R of rats, Dorsa et al.<sup>[<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> also studied its effectiveness in
protecting a distant organ, showing less damage to the lung parenchyma in this group
compared to the control group. The authors performed aortic clamping for 30 minutes
and reperfusion for 60 minutes, with three cycles of IPC lasting two minutes each.
In this study, IPC performed with the same time span used by Dorsa et al.<sup>[<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> did not result in hepatic
protection, obtaining results similar to the I/R group. However, there is still a
lot of controversy in the literature on the outcome of remote protection of IPC.
Recently, Santos et al.<sup>[<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> also
evaluated the possible protective action of IPC on lung parenchyma when performing
mesenteric I/R in rats and found no benefits in using this technique. Similarly, the
research presented here showed no liver protection with IPC on mesenteric I/R,
leaving some possibilities to be considered, still with no clear answers. First, the
times employed in IPC and the number of cycles can influence the result. This would
be true when comparing these two studies evaluating IPC pulmonary action, since
there was a difference in the method and this has been the greatest difficulty when
comparing the numerous studies of IPC - the wide variation in the method used. The
second question refers to the origin of ischemia: Dorsa et al.<sup>[<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> performed aortic clamping while
Santos et al.<sup>[<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> and the present
study used mesenteric ischemia. This factor may have some influence since in the
aortic clamping, the harmful products of the I/R would spread to all the organs and
tissues, whereas in the intestinal I/R, all blood is primarily drained to the liver,
thus leading to increased toxic concentration of reactive oxygen species on this
organ. Thirdly, one should consider that there may be some differences in resistance
to reperfusion injury; therefore, a valid protection mechanism for the lung tissue
cannot display the same efficacy in the liver parenchyma.</p><p>The effectiveness of IPC in minimizing liver reperfusion injury had already been
demonstrated by Santos et al.<sup>[<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>,
through the evaluation of its effect directly on liver I/R, as opposed to this
study, which analyzed its remote effect. That study showed the effectiveness of the
method with three cycles of IPC lasting 30 seconds each, which corroborates the
findings of this research, which also found better results with shorter cycles,
although there was no statistically significant difference.</p><p>The literature shows evidence that there may be possible differences in response
between the various organs studied for IPC. This technique has already been proven
as effective in intestinal I/R protection<sup>[<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>, nevertheless, Nakamura et al.<sup>[<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> recently demonstrated that five cycles with a
duration of thirty seconds each for IPC were not able to prevent reperfusion injury
in rats. Failure to protect tissue through IPC using short cycles had already been
published previously by Bretz et al.<sup>[<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>, who performed jejunal I/R in rabbits. The authors used IPC
for four cycles of 30 seconds each, as used here, without showing advantages over
the control group. It is important to note, however, that both aforementioned
studies only made the assessment in tissue subjected to the I/R process and not in
distant organs such as the present research.</p><p>Although several publications have demonstrated the effectiveness of IPC in different
situations of I/R since its original publication, there are still doubts about its
best application in terms of the number of cycles and their duration, especially
when considering their action at a distance. This research has shown that, in
intestinal I/R in rats, there was no difference between the two methods of IPC
applied and that they were unable to minimize reperfusion injury. Further studies
should be performed in order to conclude how it could be more effective for remote
I/R.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>IPC was unable to minimize reperfusion injury in rats undergoing mesenteric ischemia

The searches were based on the strategy developed for Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE) (details available from the authors on request) but revised appropriately for each database. Searches were carried out using the following databases: the Cochrane Library, Ovid MEDLINE 1946 to March 2015, Ovid Embase 1974 to March 2015, Web of Science, EBSCO Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) plus 1937 to March 2015, and Ovid PsycINFO 1806 to March 2015. Any systematic reviews of rehabilitation interventions in the acute period following a TIA or &#x02018;minor&#x02019; stroke were screened for additional references. The titles and abstracts of publications from the search strategy were independently screened by two authors. Additional studies were identified from reviewing the reference lists of the retrieved papers through a hand search. Articles not meeting the inclusion criteria were discarded. A standardised form (details available from the authors on request) was used to select the trials eligible for inclusion in the review with, if necessary, a third review author resolving disagreements. A record was kept of all articles excluded at this stage and the reason for their exclusion. No language restrictions were made, although all papers were written in the English language.</p><p>Data on methodological issues, eligibility criteria, interventions (including the number of participants treated and intervention provider), and study design, study duration, follow-up, comparisons, outcome measures, results, withdrawals, and adverse events were extracted independently by two review authors.

Where continuous outcomes were pooled on different scales, standardised mean differences were used. Where available, changes from baseline (mean change scores) were used in preference to follow-up scores. When combining results for the individual studies, mean differences and a random effects model were used apart from two variables, deaths and falls, when odds ratios with a random effects model were used.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessing for heterogeneity</title><p>Diversity across the studies was assessed qualitatively in terms of intervention (content, duration, frequency, provider, and setting), participant demographics, outcome measures, and follow-up.

Many other potentially eligible studies were excluded from the review because they did not present results specifically for patients who had experienced TIA or minor stroke, the focus of previous research being on moderate or severe stroke secondary prevention and rehabilitation. A meta-analysis found no evidence of significant effects on subsequent stroke risk or on vascular risk factors, although two studies reported improved measures of exercise capacity.<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p><p>This review, the first to report collated observations on the behaviour change techniques used in studies of comprehensive rehabilitation programmes for patients with acute TIA or minor stroke, suggests that providing individualised instruction to patients about how to perform specific behaviours and behavioural goal setting are key programme components but many other behaviour change techniques have been used. One programme, which reported improved exercise capacity,<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> was the only one that included discussion of behavioural consequences with patients, hinting at the importance of using this behaviour change technique in future programmes. As the emphasis on early recognition of stroke and TIA in clinical practice increases, it is important to know more about appropriate comprehensive management programmes for these patients who may not have obvious residual disability and whose needs for non-pharmacological support and rehabilitation may be overlooked.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This review attempted to identify all studies of potential relevance by developing a comprehensive search strategy and then supporting this through hand searching reference lists of all the full text articles examined in the review. The authors sought to include all eligible studies regardless of publication language, although all studies were in English.</p><p>This systematic review and meta-analysis is limited by the few studies available in this expanding and novel area of research: only four met the inclusion criteria. The authors acknowledge that the search strategy focused on &#x02018;rehabilitation&#x02019; rather than secondary prevention programmes, so may have missed potentially relevant studies. However, this has served to highlight the lack of research focus on rehabilitation or early initiation of lifestyle interventions in secondary prevention for patients with TIA. The most common reasons for exclusion of potentially eligible studies from this review were that the studies included moderate and severe strokes, with no focus on TIA/minor stroke or outcomes specified for these patients, and that the rehabilitation programme was not initiated in the acute period following diagnosis. If data were available for the patients experiencing TIA and minor stroke in studies that were excluded because they did not differentiate stroke severity for their participants, further meta-analysis could be performed to add to the strength of evidence available.</p><p>A limitation of the included studies was the lack of consistency in the outcome measures used and combining results in a meta-analysis was therefore difficult. Another study limitation related to the duration of follow-up, which varied from 6 weeks to 2 years. Data collected were pooled at the end of the study as per protocol. The results should therefore be interpreted with caution because shorter study durations may not allow sufficient time for the rehabilitation interventions to produce an impact on modifiable vascular risk factors.</p><p>Intervention intensity is generally a poorly defined concept,<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> and differences in this are considered to be a source of heterogeneity within complex interventions.<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Intervention intensity was different across the included studies and could be a potential source of bias within the review.</p><p>Further, while patients with TIA often have residual functional impairment, with fatigue and psychological issues,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> there was little recognition of this within the outcome measures used in the studies reviewed.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with previous literature</title><p>Evidence is growing regarding the contribution of change in modifiable risk factors to reductions in cardiovascular deaths,<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> and there is a need to consider how to promote non-pharmacological measures in secondary prevention.<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Indeed, five modifiable risk factors are reported to account for 82% of strokes: hypertension, smoking, obesity, unhealthy diet, and physical inactivity.<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> A pilot study of a community-based cardiac rehabilitation post-TIA and &#x02018;mild&#x02019; stroke, for patients up to 1 year post-event, showed reductions in biological markers linked to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular mortality, including aerobic capacity, lipid profile, waist circumference, body mass index, body weight, and smoking status at 6 months, but did not include a control group.<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Similarly, Kirk and colleagues<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> found that community-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes for 12 patients post-TIA and minor stroke can be effective at reducing modifiable vascular risk factors. Reviews identifying effective components of rehabilitation following the diagnosis of a TIA and &#x02018;minor&#x02019; stroke have begun to emerge,<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> but, to the authors&#x02019; knowledge, this is the first systematic review of the use of comprehensive rehabilitation programmes in the acute period (within 90 days) of the diagnosis of a TIA or &#x02018;minor&#x02019; stroke.</p><p>No significant effect on vascular risk factors was found in this review. However, Brook <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> reviewed non-pharmacological treatment effects on blood pressure and found Class 1, level A evidence for the blood pressure-lowering effects of exercise in patients with cardiovascular disease. Billinger and colleagues<xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> performed an 8-week exercise programme in 10 subjects with moderate severity stroke in the sub-acute period following their diagnosis, with a reduction in resting heart rate and improvement in the 6-minute walk test performance post-intervention. Mackay-Lyons and Makrides<xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> showed no change in peak systolic blood pressure when following survivors of stroke, undifferentiated by severity, for 6 months despite improvements in aerobic capacity. Duncan <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> found that an 8-week home-based therapist-supervised exercise programme undertaken three times a week within 30 to 90 days of a mild-to-moderate stroke improved 6-minute walk test performance in the intervention group. Thus, while previous work shows improvements in vascular risk factors associated with exercise for survivors of stroke, this review highlights the lack of evidence of this effect following rehabilitation programmes initiated early after a TIA and/or &#x02018;minor&#x02019; stroke. It is possible that patients who entered these studies have been given optimal pharmacological management and that there is limited opportunity to show statistically significant differences between groups but it was noted that none of the studies included in this review were powered to detect changes in blood pressure. This is clearly an important area that requires urgent further research.</p><p>No significant reduction in the number of falls was found in this meta-analysis. However, Taylor-Piliae and colleagues<xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> found that exercise, particularly Tai Chi-based programmes, improved balance and reduced falls in patients aged &#x0003e;50 years, who had suffered a stroke up to 3 years previously. A 12-week supervised exercise programme in survivors of sub-acute stroke also demonstrated improvements in balance.<xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> However, a Cochrane Review<xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> has shown no consistent evidence for exercise programmes preventing falls in survivors of stroke. Thus the evidence is mixed in relation to falls reduction and further high-quality studies are required in this area.</p><p>No excess deaths were found in those undergoing rehabilitation programmes compared with those not undergoing rehabilitation and thus acute rehabilitation programmes appear safe in this patient cohort. Indeed, exercise guidelines for survivors of stroke have been established, with exercise in this cohort of patients considered to be safe.<xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></p><p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence published guidance in 2014 on individual-level behaviour change interventions for promoting change in modifiable cardiovascular risk factors.<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> These guidelines recommended that behaviour change programmes, including lifestyle management programmes, should include behaviour change techniques relating to goals and planning, feedback and monitoring, and social support. In keeping with these guidelines,<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> the most frequent behaviour change techniques found in this review were facilitating patients to set goals for behavioural changes and providing instruction on how to perform the new behaviours. However, the provision of social support was only implemented in two of the four studies,<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> These specific behaviour change techniques represent only a small fraction of those available in Michie&#x02019;s taxonomy, so that there is clear scope for further research. This review highlights the poor reporting of behaviour change techniques used in interventions. It is clearly important to identify the specific behaviour change techniques used in studies to allow their replication. Future studies of rehabilitation and secondary prevention following a TIA and &#x02018;minor&#x02019; stroke should develop descriptions of the use of these techniques within their interventions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Implications for research and practice</title><p>Few studies have reported the effects of early initiation of comprehensive rehabilitation programmes, with or without pharmacological interventions, on secondary prevention for patients who have experienced a TIA or &#x02018;minor&#x02019; stroke. Rather, the focus of previous work has been on patients having &#x02018;moderate&#x02019; and &#x02018;severe&#x02019; strokes. Gaps have been identified in the knowledge regarding the effectiveness of comprehensive rehabilitation programmes, that include pharmacological and lifestyle measures, initiated in the acute period following a TIA or &#x02018;minor&#x02019; stroke when the risk of further vascular events is highest. Further randomised controlled trials, which include lifestyle interventions and details regarding the behaviour change techniques used for these patients are needed. In particular, further studies should be carried out to determine the value of initiating comprehensive secondary prevention, including non-pharmacological management, in the acute period following a TIA/minor stroke. One such emerging study is SPRITE,<xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> which aims to examine the effectiveness of a home-based rehabilitation programme, promoting the role of primary care in managing cardiovascular risk factors in the acute period following a TIA/minor stroke, particularly via non-pharmacological methods, for example, smoking cessation advice and physical activity promotion.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the assistance provided by the medical librarian, Dr Richard Fallis, in helping to formulate and then carry out

fast-track the research needed to improve approaches to disease treatment and
prevention through scientific collaborations such as the Human Heredity and
Health in Africa (H3Africa) initiative. Integral to this type of research is the
availability of samples and data for research. The need for broad access brings
along a host of ethical concerns, including those related to privacy and
confidentiality, as well as fairness and equity in access and capacity to
utilise these samples between scientists from the high income and low income
countries. Addressing these concerns while promoting genomic research,
especially in Africa, requires the implementation of a sound governance
framework. In this paper, we describe the contents of a Framework for Best
Practice for Genomics Research and biobanking in Africa that was developed,
under the auspices of the H3Africa initiative. This framework is broad enough to
be used and adapted by African countries to facilitate the development of
country-specific guidelines and to help improve the conduct and governance of
genomics research.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>genomics research</kwd><kwd>biobanking</kwd><kwd>governance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">The complete mapping of the human genome<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> brought along with it possibilities to better understand human health
and its determinants which would help improve the way diseases and health conditions
are managed. Since then, the number of genomic research studies and the need for
biobanking has been growing globally<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, with a steady increase
in the number of such studies being conducted on the African continent<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. Further scaling up genomics research with samples and
data from diverse African populations<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> has
great value considering that only a small portion of human diversity is found
outside Africa<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. Towards addressing this gap,
a $76 million initiative referred to as the Human Heredity and Health in Africa
Initiative (H3Africa) was funded jointly by the National Institutes of Health in the
US and Wellcome Trust in the UK<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. In order to
fast-track realization of the benefits inherent in genomics research, the global
community agreed to principles of &#x02018;open science&#x02019;, which promotes the
value of sharing and reuse of data and samples as a critical component of the
contemporary scientific landscape<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. Although this has
the strong potential to facilitate scientific discovery, it also raises a number of
ethical concerns which includes appropriate model of consent that will allow for
such sharing of data and samples while upholding participant autonomy<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>;
issues of withdrawal of consent<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>; ownership of samples and data<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>; privacy and confidentiality<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>; and benefit sharing<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. Such issues are not
peculiar to African countries, but require a different lens in further elucidating
the contextual concerns in African settings. Furthermore, there are concerns about
trust<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and fairness in research
collaborations<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, increased vulnerability of research participants due
to lower socio-economic levels, a history of exploitation of local populations and
researchers<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, and cultural issues that
all must be considered in the governance of genomics research and biobanking in
Africa.</p><p id="P5">In addition to these ethical concerns, regulatory frameworks for health
research in Africa are either non-existent, or where they exist, do not respond to
the specific concerns raised by genomics research and biobanking<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. Towards addressing this gap, the H3Africa
Initiative considered it expedient to develop an ethics framework describing best
practice for genomics research and biobanking. Described in terms of core principles
and elements, the Framework considered African political history of exploitations
from the West and accounts of ethical concerns in conducting genomics research and
biobanking<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> to inform the choice of these core principles and
elements. The phenomenon of &#x0201c;parachute research&#x0201d; &#x02013; where fully
equipped research teams from other countries arrive at the site where research is
needed, conduct their research independently of others, and then leave, has been
long cited as a challenge for genuine collaborative research in Africa as well as
other developing countries in the world. That such practices are not part of the
past was highlighted during the recent Ebola epidemic in some West African countries
where international researchers are said to have carted specimens away from the
affected countries without any form of oversight or recourse to local regulations or
regulators<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>. A permutation of these
practices is where African researchers are reduced to the role of data and sample
collectors, without genuine attempts to ensure their involvement beyond such
functions. One way to remedy such practices is by fostering sustainable capacity
building for African intellectual leadership in the conceptualization, design,
implementation and reporting of locally appropriate studies<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> &#x02013; this is one of the core elements of
the framework described here. It is also one of the main goals of the H3Africa
initiative including support for equipment and infrastructure to enable researchers
to develop biobanks and conduct large-scale genomics studies.</p><p id="P6">The aim of this framework is to guide governance, address sample and data
sharing concerns, as well as to serve as a resource for countries to develop their
local regulations. The process of engagement that led to the development of this
framework is reported in another manuscript. This paper highlights the key contents
of this framework and plans for its implementation across the African continent.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>An overarching philosophical basis</title><p id="P7">In developing this ethics framework, it was important for key stakeholders to
identity the overarching philosophical basis that should guide the development of
ethical best practice for genomic research and biobanking. The issues of unfair
research collaboration, lack of trust in research collaborations with scientists
from the &#x0201c;West&#x0201d; and the related scepticisms among experts and
community representatives<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> were
key considerations. These remain genuine concerns that need to be addressed to
promote inclusion of Africans in genomics research as the field progresses and the
world benefits from its outcomes<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. To ensure
that African patients and researchers partake in genomic research to optimal
benefit, we thought it important to adopt a normative basis from African cultural
philosophy. &#x0201c;Ubuntu&#x0201d; is a largely South African worldview that focuses
on the interrelatedness of humans in their quest for mutual co-existence and is one
such African philosophy that was initially selected as a foundation for the
framework<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>. However, given its strong
historical links to an era of struggle in apartheid South Africa and several
accounts limiting it as a southern African philosophy, its acceptance during our
consultations as a philosophical basis for the framework met with some resistance
from stakeholders in other parts of Africa. Instead, upon consultation we agreed
that the framework should adopt a more generic communal or solidarity-based
worldview. Such a worldview recognises that individuals are shaped by their
relations to people around them and emphasizes respectful and harmonious
relationships between them. In the African research context, we agreed that a
communitarian perspective would place central importance on reciprocity,
consultation and accountability as key ethical values.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Core Principles and Elements</title><p id="P8">The framework proposes a set of five core principles that ought to underpin
guidance for genomic research and biobanking initiatives in Africa. Whilst these
principles are not new, they need to keep of being emphasized to address particular
concerns of African communities and scientists regarding trust and unfairness in
research collaborations. A number of these principles have been echoed in a parallel
initiative, the San Code of Ethics, which seeks to define how researchers ought to
conduct their work when dealing with the San population in South Africa<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>.
The five core principles of our framework emphasize the need for research to: a) be
sensitive and respectful of African values and cultures; b) be designed primarily to
benefit the African people, while acknowledged it may equally benefit the global
population; c) ensure genuine and active intellectual participation of African
investigators and other stakeholders in research and in dissemination of findings;
and d) promote relationships characterised by respect, fairness, equity and
reciprocity. As core principles, these aspects are non-negotiable and should be
incorporated in the design and conduct of genomics research and biobanking
initiatives in Africa.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Key elements of the Framework for Best Practice</title><p id="P9">In addition to these core principles, the Framework also describes ten key
areas that need to be addressed in order to ensure that the core principles
elucidated in the framework are realised. They include: African intellectual
leadership; Consent; Community engagement; Ethics review; Avoidance of group harm
and stigma; Benefit sharing; Capacity building; International collaboration and
export of samples; Feedback of individual genetic findings; and Good governance.
These core elements are not mutually exclusive. For instance, high-level capacity
building is key to ensuring African intellectual leadership.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Highlights of the key elements of the framework</title><p id="P10">Because sample and data sharing are essential to genomics research and
biobanking, it is important that the <bold>consent process</bold> allows sharing and
re-use whilst still respecting participant choice. While there are several models of
informed consent that may support genomics research<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, our framework promotes the use of broad consent. It is important to
differentiate this from blanket consent, which is consent for sharing and use of
data and specimen without any restrictions. Broad consent as understood in the
framework allows for &#x0201c; <italic>use of samples and/or data for unspecified
future studies, but with conditions. These conditions can involve, for instance
a restriction on the types of studies or diseases that samples/data can be used
for; a specified oversight and approval process for future use; ongoing
consultation with sample donors about future use, if possible; and a process
allowing participants to withdraw samples or data from the storage facility that
holds them</italic>&#x0201d;. Although debates about appropriate consent models
for genomics and biobanking continue, there is growing consensus that it may be the
&#x02018;best compromise&#x02019; consent model<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>. In their critical presentation of the outcomes of a workshop which
aimed to identify the appropriate consent model for collection of biospecimen for
use in future research, Grady <italic>et al.</italic> (2015) submitted that broad
consent was considered &#x0201c;ethically appropriate, and preferable to lack of
consent for the majority of biospecimen collection for future research
uses&#x0201d;<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>. Furthermore, Tindana and
De Vries (2016) in their paper on the perspectives of broad consent for genomics
research in LMICs concluded that there are no <italic>a priori</italic> reasons
against the use of broad consent for genomics research in Africa<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>. Empirical research conducted since then suggests that
participants may also be supportive of broad consent if done sensitively and
respectfully<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>. The proposed framework for acceptable broad consent
includes initial consent, oversight of future research projects, and, when feasible,
mechanisms for maintaining contact and communication with specimen donors. There is,
however, an agreement among most proponents of broad consent that for optimal
participant protection, whenever broad consent is used in genomics research to allow
for future research use, it needs to be accompanied with a mechanism that promotes
accountability and equity<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> in sharing
specimen and/or data with other researchers while also ensuring that
participants&#x02019; choice are respected<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>.</p><p id="P11">The Framework considers that genuine <bold>community engagement</bold> is a
key component of ensuring best practice in genomics research and biobanking in
Africa, not in the least because it promotes respect for community values and
perspectives and maximizes the social value of research<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>. Community engagement is one way to ensure that
research conduct is aligned with a communitarian worldview. Furthermore, genuine
community engagement is proposed as a condition for the use of broad consent<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>.
Community engagement should take place along the entire spectrum of research
activities, from initial planning phases and data collection, to include the return
of general study findings when projects end.</p><p id="P12">The framework recommends that all primary genomic research and biobanking
studies must be reviewed by a competent research <bold>ethics review</bold>
committee based in the country where samples are collected or stored. Research
ethics review fulfils an important role in promoting ethical best practice and is
key to the protection of research participants Such a role is very important in the
African research that takes place in the context of a high burden of disease, poor
access to basic necessities and healthcare, low average income and literacy levels
as well as unfamiliarity of most of the people with biomedical research generally
and genomic research specifically. A particular challenge is the limited capacity of
research ethics committees in Africa to review genomics research and biobanking
projects<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>. Using a matrix that maps the various elements of this
framework against important issues that ethics committees are recommended to
consider, <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> is proposed as a practical
tool for ethics committees to provide oversight for good governance in genomics
research and biobanking.</p><p id="P13">The <bold>avoidance of group harm or stigma</bold> is considered important
particularly in the African research context where researchers may work with members
of many different population groups, each characterised by their own language,
culture and belief systems, some of which may be marginalised or discriminated
against. Research may also involve groups of people suffering from stigmatised
conditions or outlawed or stigmatising behaviours, phenotypes or lifestyles. In such
a context, the reporting of genomic research results could aggravate existing stigma
or marginalisation. An example is the way in which genomic research on the San
included findings that were considered potentially stigmatising<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>. In this example, Namibian San leaders were approached
for participation in genomics research<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
without involvement of San political leadership or individuals with experience in
science who could have properly explained the research project and who could have
helped the research team in designing more appropriate consent processes. Whilst
presented internationally as an example of &#x02018;best practice&#x02019; for the
involvement of &#x02018;indigenous&#x02019; African populations<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, this project, as well as its inconsiderate
presentation of research results, was perceived as deeply offensive by the Namibian
and South African San Councils and led to the development of the San Code for Ethics
referenced earlier.</p><p id="P14">Because of this and other experiences, the framework requires researchers to
be mindful of whether and how groups are identified in genomics research, and how
research results are reported. Importantly, the framework suggests that community
engagement may be one way to alleviate the potential for stigma. Genuine
intellectual leadership by senior African researchers and their meaningful
involvement in the preparation of manuscripts is equally important to ensure the
respectful engagement with African populations and the responsible reporting of
study findings.</p><p id="P15">In terms of <bold>benefit sharing</bold>, the framework proposes that
genomics research and biobanking may bring intangible benefits in the form of
general study results, social recognition, knowledge production and translation of
relevant knowledge to healthcare practice. Whilst there may be some tangible
benefits emanating from genomics research and biobanking in the form of (patentable)
innovations or technologies, these are rare and should not be the focus of benefit
sharing discussions. The framework describes, first, that it is imperative that
researchers ensure that intangible benefits accrue to researchers and communities
and they should be aware of this. It also describes that researchers should be
mindful not to raise unrealistic expectations, and to clearly describe to
communities and individuals the nature of potential benefits they can expect and
those that they cannot.</p><p id="P16">
<bold>Capacity building</bold> for African scientists is one of the central elements
of the framework, and has been identified as one of the primary benefits emanating
out of ongoing research endeavours such as H3Africa<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>. Building a critical mass
of scholars in genomics and biobanking is essential to ensure the sustainability of
these research approaches in Africa. Similarly, such a critical mass is needed to
ensure that this research can be conducted by African research teams and under
African intellectual leadership in the future, provided that capacity is built along
the entire academic hierarchy and includes junior scientists as well as more senior
ones. Importantly, capacity building would need to focus not just on training in
genomics science and bioinformatics, but also in grants administration, contract
negotiation, ethics and in transferable skills such as grant writing which enables
sustainability of the genomics research. The expectation is that broad capacity
building would ensure that research is responsive to the health needs of Africans,
is sensitive to African ethical, legal and social issues, and that there is a strong
avenue for the implementation of relevant research findings into national health
policy and clinical practice.</p><p id="P17">With regard to the <bold>export of samples</bold> to other countries, the
framework acknowledges that this is often viewed as problematic by research ethics
committees and other regulators, not in the least because it is viewed as
perpetuating inequality. For this reason, the framework proposes that export should
only be permitted where researchers can outline how their work will contribute to
reducing global health inequality and what measures they have put in place to
strengthen the research system in the country where the samples were collected. One
example would be where junior and senior African students and researchers are
meaningfully involved in all aspects of the research process, including aspects that
happen in non-African laboratories and universities. Material Transfer Agreements
are fundamental to underpin the fair export of samples, and guidance offered for
instance by the</p><p id="P18">Whilst the framework offers some guidance on the <bold>feedback of
individual genetic research results</bold>, it mainly proposes a range of
questions that need to be considered in determining whether and under which
conditions the return of research results may be appropriate in the African research
context. Given the complexity of the issues, the H3Africa Consortium is developing a
policy guiding researchers in how to decide which results to feedback, which expands
on the summary guidance given in the framework.</p><p id="P19">Lastly, implementing a <bold>good governance</bold> regime is recommended in
order to tie all these elements together towards optimal protection of participant
in genomics research and biobanking. This should be a mechanism that provides
oversight for re-use of samples and data sharing in line with the principles and
elements set out in the framework. Such oversight is expected to among other things,
ensure that decisions to provide access to sample and data for secondary use are
sensitive to the need to promote genomics scholarship from African scientists and
facilitate preferential use of data and access to samples for such scientists for a
reasonable period of time. Such a preferential use provision is expected to further
support African scientists, who may have challenges in engaging with the data and
specimen available as fast as their counterparts due to systemic challenges such as
poor power supply, poor access to academic databases for research, poor access to
fast and reliable internet and so forth; or infrastructural challenges such as the
availability of databases with comparable security protections that will allow for
sharing data across countries and continents. In making these decisions however, it
is important to find an appropriate balance between over-protection, which may
hinder good science with potential benefit to humanity derivable from it. Typically,
such a governance regime is achieved through the establishment of Sample Access
Committees and Data Access Committee<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>.
However, each country that seeks to use the framework, as a guide may have to
develop a structure that works best considering local peculiarities.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Implementation mechanisms and amendments</title><p id="P20">The next step in our quest to consolidate and harmonize standards for
African genomics research and biobanking is to engage broadly around the framework,
and to develop template guidelines for adaptation.</p><p id="P21">Firstly, the framework provides the basis for further discussions and
engagement with professional organisations, regulators and ethics committees across
Africa. Through our consultation processes, we have built up a rich network of
contacts with regulators and ethics committees at local, regional and national
levels across the continent, and we are liaising with all of these to create
awareness of the minimal standards described in the Framework. We are also liaising
with professional science organisations including for instance the African Academy
of Sciences (AAS), to explore how that organisation can take a leadership role in
advancing ethical standards of genomics research and biobanking on the
continent.</p><p id="P22">In terms of ensuring the incorporation of the standards outlined in the
Framework into research practice, we are preparing more detailed guidelines that
expand on the items in the Framework. This resource will be publicly available for
use by ethics committees across the continent, and the hope is that ethics
committees and national ethics councils will adapt and adopt the guidelines so that
they become the gold standard for national regulation of genomics and biobanking. In
order to ensure that they do, we will continue our engagement activities with
committees and national councils. In addition, we are increasingly involved in
offering training to national and local ethics committees, which are invaluable in

Working Group on Ethics. All authors are part of the task force assigned by this
Working Group to develop the Framework. They are reporting on the Framework on
behalf of the Working Group. The process involved consultations with funding
institutions - NIH and Wellcome Trust, stakeholders involved in genomics research
and biobanking &#x02013; the Bridging Biobanking and Biomedical Research across
Europe and Africa (B3Africa) initiative and the Academy of Science of South Africa,
as well as selected ethics committee members from Botswana, Uganda and Ethiopia.
Akin Abayomi, Adamu Addissie, Julius Ecuru, Mark Guyer, Mary Kasule, Michael Pepper
and Godfrey Tangwa, Ebony Madden, Patricia Marshall, Odile Ouwe Missi Oukem-Boyer
provided comments through the H3A Working Group on Ethics. Clement Adebamowo and
Michele Ramsay provided extensive comments through the H3Africa Steering Committee.

biobanking in Africa, which is valuable in the African public health context and to
address global health inequality. The article is well-written and concise in its
summary of the core principles and key elements of the framework. We see the
contribution of the framework in the context of ELS implications of genomics and
biobanks in its emphasis on the need for research to be sensitive and respectful of
diverse cultures, values and belief systems of African populations. Also of
significance is the goal to enhance capacity building and genuine intellectual
participation of African researchers and stakeholders in genomics research. The
authors of this article are to be commended for this important work.</p><p id="P65"> Overall, the manuscript will make an important contribution. We have only
minor suggestions for improvement. Although the key elements of the framework are
well-presented, the authors do not address potential challenges that may be
encountered while applying those key elements. We realise that the purpose of the
article is to lay out the framework, and so does not address implementation issues.
However, some additional detail may be good to add, in particular in the context of
community engagement, which the authors emphasize as a key component for ensuring
best practice in genomics research and biobanking in Africa. However, it is not
clear from the framework what the authors mean by &#x0201c;genuine community
engagement&#x0201d;. There is a&#x000a0;rich literature on engaging community members in
research and the values and challenges of doing so. Community engagement goes beyond
the meaningful involvement of African researchers to include individuals from the
broader population and specific groups, and will need to address issues such as
power dynamics between researchers who are considered experts and community
members.</p><p id="P67">
<underline>Other issues:</underline>
</p><p id="P69"> On p. 3. The authors mention that &#x0201c;The process of engagement that
led to the development of this framework is reported in another manuscript.&#x0201d;
A reference to this manuscript should be provided.</p><p id="P71"> The paragraph on export of samples to other countries is incomplete (p.
6).&#x000a0;</p><p id="P73"> The &#x0201c;implementation mechanisms and amendments&#x0201d; section (p. 7)
describes the next steps for raising awareness and engaging health organisations and
national councils with the framework. It would be great to have more detail
regarding future evaluation of the framework and the Working Group&#x02019;s
engagement activities.</p><p id="P74">We have read this submission. We believe that we have an appropriate level
of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard.</p></body></sub-article></article>

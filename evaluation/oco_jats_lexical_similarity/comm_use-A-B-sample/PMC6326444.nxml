al.<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>
analyzed the inflammation resulting from myocardial revascularization techniques
with (on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting - ONCAB) and without (off-pump
coronary artery bypass grafting - OPCAB) cardiopulmonary bypass. The authors
concluded that there was an increase in us-CRP in the postoperative period compared
to the preoperative period. This increase occurred in all moments assessed
postoperatively. There was no difference in the us-CRP behavior between the two
myocardial revascularization techniques<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Despite the unexpected result in differentiating the two coronary artery bypass
grafting techniques, the importance of the inflammatory reaction triggered by
cardiopulmonar bypass is always a contradictory subject. One has the impression that
the issue is overestimated, considering the incidence of systemic inflammatory
response syndrome (SIRS) in the milieu of cardiac surgery<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. The search for
biomarkers of inflammation is a constant concern, especially considering the
cost-benefit ratio. In this regard, cytokine dosage is not justified in clinical and
surgical practice.</p><p>In the search for markers of the inflammatory reaction, the chemiluminescence dosage
of the stable nitric oxide (nitrite and nitrate-NOx) products, although low cost,
was not relevant<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. Still taking into account the nitric oxide release
pathway, the determination of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) could be more
sensitive, but the methodology is expensive and difficult to apply in the operating
room. Thus, the tendency to search for an inexpensive and easy-to-use biomarker is
observed, increasing interest in "old biomarkers" such as C-reactive protein,
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR). This
trend may be noted in recent publications in the Brazilian Journal of Cardiovascular
Surgery (BJCVS)<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>NLR is a new addition to the long list of these inflammatory markers. NLR, which is
calculated from complete blood count with differential, is an inexpensive, easy to
obtain and widely available marker of inflammation, which can aid in the risk
stratification of patients with various cardiovascular diseases, in addition to the
traditionally used markers. Recently, NLR has been reported as a prognostic marker
for the outcome from coronary artery bypass grafting<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Despite being a non-specific marker of inflammation, C-reactive protein (CRP) and
alkaline phosphatase are routinely measured by hospital laboratories and therefore
would be useful in cardiac surgery. Also, neutrophil/lymphocyte (N/L) and
platelet/lymphocyte (P/L) ratios have become useful inflammatory biomarkers. Aldemir
et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>
showed a significant increase in total leukocyte and neutrophil counts and N/L ratio
and a decrease in lymphocyte counts were observed at all time points after surgery
in both groups. N/L ratio was significantly higher in the with cardiopulmonary
bypass (CPB) group compared to the OPCAB group on the first postoperative day, but
this difference disappeared on the fifth postoperative day.</p><p>Elevated CRP levels have been associated with severe adverse cardiac events,
including death. However, the causal association of CRP with atherogenesis is less
clear, and there are data suggesting that it is a bystander rather than a true risk
factor. It is importante to note that CRP levels decrease in response to
anti-inflammatory agents, making it useful for monitoring the efficacy of new
anti-inflammatory drugs. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and CPR analyses are the
oldest markers of inflammation and acute myocardial infarction and are still useful
in clinical practice<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In 1930, Tillet and Francis published the first report on the occasional discovery of
CRP. In 1943, the first clues to the possible connection between CRP and
atherothrombotic events were described by Lofstrom and later by
Kroop<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. Looking at the "eternal pursuit" of credible and
economically viable markers, are not we "going back to the past"? The current data
is suggestive...</p></sec><sec><title>Heart Team and the Indian Philosophy and the Suggestion of an Editors' Heart
Team</title><p>The specific term 'Heart Team' is quite recent and was incorporated into European and
American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines
subsequent to the pivotal SYNTAX trial. Surely, it gained popularity based on the
context of coronary interventions and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)
and other complex endovascular interventions. However, the 'Heart Team' concept
deserves some criticism: 1) The 'Heart Team' can certainly compromise the basis of
medical practice based on the doctor-patient relationship; 2) The way we practice
the concept of 'Heart Team' today is quite fragmented, inconsistent and uneven with
"shades of grey all over"; 3) Unfortunately, there are physicians who can do routine
work masquerading as emergency to avoid the 'Heart Team' for doing routine coronary
interventions through an emergency route, for better reimbursement and for not
putting the patients on the waiting list.</p><p>These points are highlighted by Yadava<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>: 1) Thinking philosophically, the concept of
'Heart Team' is a reality or is it a 'Platonic Illusion'? 2) The concept of ' Heart
Team' in cardiovascular medicine is ahead of its time? 3) The 'Heart Team' may
reduce culpability for wrong decisions and subsequent medical-legal litigation; 4)
Most of it has been an empty rhetoric, suiting the medical fraternity, but much to
the indignation and disadvantage of the hapless patient.</p><p>When we chose 'Heart Team' as the opening theme for this edition, in the search for
literature data, we find the brilliant text of Yadava<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>, which incorporated our
ideas one hundred percent. Any attempt to compose the text made clear the plagiarism
of ideas.</p><p>Dr. Yadava is CEO and Chief Cardiac Surgeon at the National Heart Institute, New
Delhi and Editor-in-Chief of Indian Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery.
He does research in adult Cardiac Surgery and Cardiology. These personal data led us
to the thought, "Why not an Editors Heart Team?" We contacted Dr. Yadava who was
ready to write the Editorial published in this issue of the Brazilian Journal of
Cardiovascular Surgery (BJCVS). We believe that this provocative text will bring
deep reflections.</p></sec><sec><title>Articles in this Issue</title><p>This issue of BJCVS presents a blind peer-reviewed selection of 15 papers that were

cardiovascular diseases, with 80% of deaths occurring in middle- and low-income
countries.</p><p>As the heart is essential for maintenance of life, issues related to this organ are
closely associated with behavior and emotions. When a cardiopathy occurs, a complex
interaction of variables interferes in the progression and patient's
recovery<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The chronic character of heart diseases is associated with threats and uncertainties
"which relate to psychic suffering, psychosocial integrity, social disadvantage,
physiological incapacities, uncertainty of treatment success, possibility of
rejection leading to death"<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>A significant number of studies have found a relation between mood disorders, anxiety
and heart disease. The presence of depressive symptoms in patients with heart
disease doubles the risk of death associated with cardiovascular diseases. Thus,
rehabilitation of a patient with heart disease should not only address physical and
physiological functions, but also cognitive, adaptive and psychological functioning,
especially if, in the post-operative period, the patient receives a new heart, such
as cardiac transplantation<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In more severe heart diseases, such as refractory heart failure (HF), cardiac
transplantation is recognized as the best therapeutic strategy. It is therefore
indicated for those patients with worse prognosis and without alternatives of
clinical treatments<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Evaluation and follow-up of interdisciplinary teams are fundamental for candidates
and patients who underwent heart transplant. From a psychosocial point of view,
stress, negative emotions, coping resources, lifestyle and other factors can have a
significant impact on the recovery and rehabilitation of these patients. The
presence of mental disorders in these patients "have a negative and direct
repercussion on adherence, necessary lifestyle modifications and the discipline
imposed by the treatment protocol"<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>After cardiac transplantation, concerns regarding the condition of being a
post-transplant patient require adaptations in lifestyle, including, for example,
infection care, properly balanced diet, weight maintenance, strict and continued
administration of immunosuppressive drugs, adherence to the team's advices for
maintenance of well-being, and reduction of complications, especially in the early
months.</p><p>Approaching the psychological aspects of these patients becomes necessary throughout
the entire process, mainly in patient discharge and longitudinal
follow-up<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. A successful
cardiac transplantation not only prolongs life, but also optimizes the patient's
psychosocial functioning<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Considering the importance of psychosocial factors in heart disease and the
maintenance of adaptive resources after cardiac surgeries, this study aims to
identify, in patients who underwent cardiac transplantation, the presence of mental
disorders and symptoms of depression and anxiety; to evaluate the perception of
quality of life and coping strategies after heart transplantation; to correlate
variables and compare them in relation to gender, age group and length of time after
transplantation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>Cross-sectional, population-based descriptive study, with quantitative analysis. A
total of 33 patients under follow-up after heart transplantation were enrolled in
the Heart Transplant Service of the Hospital de Base de S&#x000e3;o Jos&#x000e9; do
Rio Preto, aged 17 years and over, regardless of class or gender. All patients
attending the service (N=37) were invited at the start date of collection,
regardless of the length of time after transplantation, that was between 4 and 14
years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>

</p><p>One of them presented cognitive limitations, one refused to participate due to lack
of time to respond to the questionnaires and two died before being evaluated. The
small sample size is justified by the relatively low frequency of heart transplants
in the unit and the deaths. The study only included patients who underwent heart
transplantation at the Hospital de Base de S&#x000e3;o Jos&#x000e9; do Rio Preto,
state of S&#x000e3;o Paulo.</p><p>The instruments used in the research protocol are approved for use by SatePsi
(Sistema de Avalia&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Testes Psicol&#x000f3;gicos, Psychological
Testing System) and regulated by the Federal Council of Psychology; structured and
validated in the Brazilian version; with quick and simple administration and
interpretation; with reduced cost; seen in similar studies; and easy to
understand.</p><p>Based on literature, its guidelines manuals and practice, the average time of
administration of all the instruments was 1 hour and 30 minutes<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>. A pilot protocol was performed in order to ascertain the

distribution (67%, n=22), incomplete elementary school (48%, n=16), married (70%,
n=23), retired (85%, n=28), living with spouse and/or children (76%, n=25) and
living with three or four people (61%, n=20).</p><p>Although the age of the sample varied between 30 and 71 years, the age range of the
majority of study participants was concentrated between 30 and 60 years (MD=55)
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>

</p><p>In the comparison by sex, women presented higher ages. Among the male participants,
the age range varied between 30 and 71 years, with concentration between 44 and 59
years (MD=55). Among women, the age varied between 34 and 71 years, with
concentration in the range of 45 to 62 years (MD=53).</p><p>The length of time after transplantation indicates a minimum of four years and a
maximum of 14 years for both sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>).
Differences could be observed only in concentration by age. The time since heart
transplantation in the female sample, aged 52 years or less, was between 7 and 12
(MD=9). In women aged 53 years or over, they had a concentration between 9 and 12
(MD=11). Among men, those up to 52 years old presented a concentration between 6 and
7 (MD=6) and those aged 53 years and over, concentration between 10 and 13
(MD=12).</p><p>

</p><p>Among the psychosocial variables, symptoms of depression and anxiety, perceived
quality of life and coping strategies were evaluated.</p><p>Assessment of depression symptoms indicated that 91% (n=30) of the patients had
minimal symptoms, 6% (n=2) mild symptoms and 3% (n=1) moderate symptoms. When
compared by gender, 95% (n=21) of the men presented minimal symptoms and 5% (n=1)
light symptoms, without occurrence of moderate and severe symptoms; 82% (n=9) of the
women presented minimal symptoms and 18% (n=2) had mild or moderate symptoms,
without serious events. Data from MINI revealed that 3.03% (n=1) presented
diagnostic criteria for depression. The instrument did not identify the presence of
other mental disorders.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref> shows the percentage of occurrences of
somatic and cognitive-affective symptoms of depression after cardiac
transplantation, as well as the comparison by gender, age group and time since

</p><p>The assessment of anxiety symptoms indicated that 94% (n=31) of the symptoms
experienced by patients focused on the minimum level. Mild and moderate levels were
also identified (6%, n=2). Minor symptoms were presented by 95% (n=21) of males and
91% (n=1) of females; 5% (n=1) of the male sample had mild symptoms and 9% (n=1) of
the female sample had moderate anxiety symptoms. No serious events of anxiety
symptoms have been identified in patients.</p><p>The perception of quality of life and satisfaction in physical, psychological, social
and environmental domains was assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure
5</xref>). The values are presented on a scale of 0 to 100: 0-20 (very bad),
21-40 (bad), 41-60 (neither bad nor good), 61-80 (good), and 81-100 (very good).</p><p>
<fig id="f5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Domains of quality of life after heart transplantation by gender.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-32-03-0162-g05"/></fig>
</p><p>In the overall sample, the data indicated 'good' perceptions in all domains. Women
assessed all quality of life domains as 'good', except the physical domain,
classified as 'neither bad nor good'. Men, however, have revealed 'good' perceptions
in all domains evaluated. No domain was considered 'very good', 'bad' or 'very bad'.
Significant differences between the sexes were found in the psychological domains
(<italic>P</italic>=0.0071) and in the environmental satisfaction
(<italic>P</italic>=0.0387), with higher results for men.</p><p>Regarding the coping methods used by patients to deal with stressors, high scores
were obtained for the use of problemoriented strategies, followed by a focus on
religiosity or fanciful thinking and social support. Less frequent strategies (lower
scores) were found for emotion-focused coping.</p><p>Significant differences were found in the domain of coping focused on religiosity or
fanciful thinking in comparison with age group. Older patients (53 years or older)
had higher scores on coping focused on religion or fanciful thinking
(<italic>P</italic>=0.039).</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> presents the correlations between ways

corresponds to the number of patients evaluated from May 2015 and April 2016 and it
is due to the low frequency of heart transplantation at the Institution.</p><p>Sociodemographic characteristics similar to the observed in this study were found in
the literature. A study carried out in a hospital in Belo Horizonte, which
investigated the demographic and epidemiological profile of patients undergoing a
heart transplant, observed a predominance of male patients, living in cohabitation,
with incomplete primary education and retirees. The average age range of 53 years
can also be observed in other studies on the subject<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The predominantly male profile of the participants is justified because of the
advanced age and because male gender is associated with the number and intensity of
risk factors for heart diseases. Studies analyzing the prevalence of risk factors by
sex have found that smoking, uncontrolled blood pressure, high blood cholesterol,
low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), and elevated levels of
triglycerides are significantly more prevalent in men than in women<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>When observing the low levels of symptoms of depression and anxiety, we can draw a
parallel with studies that monitored and evaluated these same variables in patients
in the waiting list and up to 12 months after transplantation, which also revealed a
decrease in these symptoms. During the wait for transplantation, 32.1% of the
patients had psychological disorders. After surgery, the indices had a decrease of
21.3%<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>. This reduction
is attributed to a better perception of quality of life related to physical aspects,
return to activities of daily living, to work and, above all, to increased survival.
The literature also shows that these patients dedicate a greater focus to future
planning, especially regarding help and social support needs, and this focus is the
cause for reduced symptoms of anxiety, depression and good levels of quality of
life, approaching of mental health levels of the general population<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>However, it is important to evaluate symptoms of depression in these patients and to
discriminate them in terms of their characteristics, <italic>i.e.</italic>, somatic
or cognitive. Studies that have reported the occurrence of depression symptoms
associated with heart disease have raised questions about the validity of evaluating
depression symptoms with self-report questionnaires in the context of acute or
chronic medical conditions. Physical symptoms after heart surgeries resemble the
somatic symptoms of depression. Thus, an assessment of depression symptoms in these
patients should discriminate among somatic symptoms of depression and symptoms of
the disease itself<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>According to Almeida et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>,
typical physiological aspects of post-transplantation influence cardiovascular
rehabilitation after transplantation. The authors investigated complications
following cardiac transplantation and pointed out some physical symptoms that arise
from the clinical presentation: cardiac denervation, lower heart rate response to
exercise, increased resting heart rate and sympathetic tone, use of
immunosuppressive drugs with effects on muscle, possibility of cardiac cachexia and
physical deconditioning that may be of long duration, arterial hypertension,
subjective fatigue and others.</p><p>Depression is associated with somatic and behavioral changes. Thus, the instrument
used to evaluate symptoms of depression, BDI-II, divided these symptoms reported by
the patients into Cognitive-affective and Somatic-affective. The second factor, also
known as 'somatic', includes: lack of energy, changes in sleeping patterns and
appetite, irritability, difficulty concentrating and tiredness or fatigue<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Common symptoms after cardiac surgery include fatigue or loss of energy, changes in
sleep, changes in appetite, and "may be misinterpreted by healthcare providers,
researchers or patients as mood-related"<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>, precisely because they resemble the somatic symptoms of
depression.</p><p>The findings of this study resemble those of other studies, as pointed out by Thombs
et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>. The same instrument
used in this study to measure symptoms of depression (BDI-II), when used in patients
with heart diseases, revealed that 50% to 75% of the patients report occurrence of
somatic symptoms, which may be responsible for up to 10 points in the total score of
depression symptoms. This factor should be observed by the professional who will
evaluate patients in these situations, since there is considerable practical
difficulty in determining if specific somatic symptoms, such as fatigue and change
of appetite, are a result of the patient's depression or medical condition.</p><p>Regarding the quality of life of the sample, despite the possible adverse outcomes
due to the surgical process, such as infections, hospitalization and frequent
hospitalizations, lifestyle adjustments and frequent use of medications, the data
showed a good perception of general quality of life, with better scores for the
psychological domain, followed by social domain, environment and physical domain.
Vasconcelos et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> suggest that
cardiac transplantation is perceived by patients as a possibility to restore their
health conditions, being one of the reasons for good perceptions of quality of life.
"Even with all the difficulties, organ receptors were happy, grateful and victorious
for surviving after heart transplantation"<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Literature shows similar data to those compiled in this study regarding quality of
life. Czyzewski et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> point
to the increase of good perception of the quality of life in patients after cardiac
transplantation. Studies indicate that quality of life before heart transplantation
is correlated with subjective perception of health, while in post-transplantation
the perception of quality of life is directly related to the level of satisfaction
of the patient with his/her health status, which is one of the main factors that
allow the increase of indices<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In order to cope with the post-transplantation situation, aiming at reducing stress,
patients in this study used more problem-focused coping than emotion-focused coping,
the latter less strategy used.</p><p>Collected data resemble the Seidl et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> observations, when they affirm that the results regarding
the use of emotion-oriented strategies are smaller in people whose stressor agent is
a health problem. Authors discussing emotion-focused coping postulate that the use
of this strategy expresses feelings of guilt about oneself and the other, as well as
avoidant behaviors concomitant with negative emotions, leading one to suppose that,
in the case of higher scores, it would also be possible to find relevant
psychological difficulties.</p><p>Researches have found similar results to those obtained in this study regarding the
strategies used by each of the sexes. Men use problem-focused strategies and women
use religious/fantasy practices<sup>[<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Findings on coping in women showed higher averages oriented to religious practices,
followed by focus on the problem, seeking social support and, finally, focus on
emotion. For some women, the disease presents itself as a "bargaining process with
God, of life and health, for others, an opportunity to acquire new values, rethink
life and value the spiritual side, which is put into practice after the
disease"<sup>[<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>. This
information influences the results obtained in the studies.</p><p>When correlating coping strategies with depression, levels were inversely
proportional. The more the patient used coping strategies, the smaller the symptoms
of depression. Kroemeke<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> states
that this correlation is expected, since patients experience greater or lesser
symptoms of depression according to their ability to evaluate events, their coping
strategies and their efforts made available to act. The author also emphasizes that
patients with low depression symptoms have a more positive perception of the disease
and show greater adaptive resources facing the situation.</p><p>Patients with good indexes of coping strategies had better perceptions of quality of
life, greater satisfaction with health and with physical, psychological, social and
environmental aspects. Studies have shown that patients achieve significant
improvements in their quality of life when they have greater social, family and
spiritual support<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The more patients use problem-oriented coping strategies, the lower the symptoms of
depression. Bonanno et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>
concluded that patients with low rates of depressive symptoms are more likely to
deal with problem-focused strategies and less likely to use emotion-focused
strategies, which resembles the findings of this study. Nunes et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> found a significant association
between focus on the problem and symptoms of depression, pointing out that this
relationship indicates that the greater the focus on the problem, the less likely
the presence of depressive symptoms or maybe "the more depressive symptoms, the less
likely the adoption of strategies focused on the problem".</p><p>Data indicate that the less patients use emotion-oriented coping strategies, the
better the perceptions of quality of life and satisfaction with health, physical
domain, psychological domain, social relations and environment. Nunes et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup>, who investigated
the coping methods most used in the process of illness, revealed similar data. The
authors found that the emotionbased coping method is positively correlated with the
presence of anxious and depressive symptoms, <italic>i.e</italic>., the more
patients focused on emotion, the greater the symptoms of anxiety and depression,
leading to impairments in quality of life.</p><p>The numbers of this study indicate that the more focus on social support the patient
presented, the better his/her perception of quality of life and his/her satisfaction
with the psychological domain, with social relations and with the environment.</p><p>Data found in literature revealed that, besides social support being considered a
factor of protection and health promotion, its positive effects are associated with
different types of support offered by the family, being able to be both emotional
and functional, <italic>i.e</italic>., support related to activities of daily
living. Thus, social support allows a more adequate management of emotions,
affective, cognitive and feedback orientations, helping to increase the patient's
adaptive skills<sup>[<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In face of the high prevalence of risk factors and cardiovascular diseases in men and
post-transplanted male predominance in this sample, all the results were more
significant in men. This feature has a straight link with the results of this study.
At the same time that we observed that the majority was male patients, we also
observed lower levels of depression, anxiety (and other psychological disorders), as
well as better perceptions of quality of life, satisfaction with health and
problem-focused coping, which means more adequate ways of facing the post-surgical
and follow-up conditions. Although more vulnerable to risk factors and
cardiovascular diseases, men are likely to face more objectively a situation than
women. Women used more coping focused on religious thoughts, which is more
subjective; thus, obtaining inferior results.</p><p>Thus, pre-transplant psychological preparation, as well as follow-up after
transplantation, are required. The type of post-transplant follow-up and its impact
still need to be better assessed. Pfeifer &#x00026; Ruschel<sup>[<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> concluded that heart transplant preparation was
associated with better coping indexes when compared to post-transplant
follow-up.</p><p>Cardiac transplantation, besides being the most effective therapy for patients with
refractory heart disease, also represents the possibility of improvements in quality
of life. The surgical procedure, concomitant with a psychological evaluation,
pretransplant psychological preparation and post-transplantation follow-up, allow
the development of coping strategies, improving symptoms of depression and anxiety,
and directly influencing the perception of quality of life and levels of
satisfaction with health. Thus, interdisciplinary teams are needed to ensure
favorable conditions for recovery, adherence to treatment and solving problems that
arise in the course of procedures.</p><p>Regarding the psychologist's performance in health teams, individual and group visits
are suggested. While the individual visit aims psychic reorganization, readaptation
and resignification in face of the new perspective of health, group care creates the
possibility of contact with other transplant patients. This contact, often performed
in waiting room, places patients and family members with information and appropriate
models of coping.</p><p>Although many studies have evaluated these variables separately, we did not find any
showing correlation or association between these variables in post-transplanted
patients. Therefore, this study provides contributions to clinical practice and
psychological interventions with these patients. According to the results,
psychological interventions should focus on problem-focused coping, enabling
patients to have lower rates of anxiety, depression and better perceptions of
quality of life and satisfaction with their health.</p><p>This study also alerts clinicians and researchers that depression assessment through
somatic symptoms should be performed with caution, since physical symptoms resulting
from heart transplant may resemble depression somatic symptoms.</p><p>Some limitations of this study can be pointed out. Even if the design has allowed
obtaining information and evaluations of the variables of interest, the
cross-sectional method does not allow the definition of causal associations between
domains, since, in the case of an interruption in time, the possible determinants
and outcomes are seen at the same time, preventing the use of criteria of
causes.</p><p>This study design also does not assure inferences about the longitudinal impact of
the studied variables. There is a need for a control group and broadening of
knowledge about the development of aspects related to symptoms, perceptions and
coping, as well as the emotional responses of patients who underwent transplantation
in the short, medium and long-term.</p><p>The daily life of a patient undergoing heart transplantation is characterized by new
situations that require adaptations of the family and social network. Including
family and the social group in future research is relevant to a more comprehensive
understanding of the phenomenon in question, since this study was limited to the
patient's perceptions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Based on the outcomes of this study, we can conclude that patients who underwent
cardiac transplantation showed good perceptions of quality of life in all domains,
even with minimal, mild and moderate levels of symptoms of depression and anxiety.
Patients who underwent transplantation had more somatic symptoms of depression.
Thus, it is important to distinguish between cognitive and somatic symptoms when
evaluating depression in patients with chronic diseases, since somatic symptoms may
be due to illness rather than a depressive process itself.</p><p>Despite the use of all coping styles, there was predominance of problem-focused
coping and less use of emotion-oriented strategies that are probably associated with
the positive indices of perception of quality of life and the low occurrences of
depression and anxiety in the sample.</p><table-wrap id="t4" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="50%" span="1"/><col width="50%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FBT</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Drafting the work or revising it critically for

Over the past two decades, tendon disease has been characterised as a &#x02018;degenerative condition&#x02019;.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> More recently, the identification of key immune cell populations and signalling molecules as important regulators in the initiation and propagation of other musculoskeletal diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and spondyloarthropathy, has led to a re-emergence of interest in the role of inflammation in tendon disease.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;7</xref>
</p><p>The term &#x02018;tendinopathy&#x02019; has been popularised to reinforce the notion that the underlying disease mechanisms are not fully understood.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> However, there is growing support for the contribution of immune cells and inflammatory mediators to the development of tendinopathy.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;13</xref> Recent research showed that numbers of macrophages and mast cells are significantly increased in tendinopathic compared with healthy tendon tissues, and that inflammatory and fibrotic cytokines, peptides and growth factors have altered expression profiles in diseased compared with healthy tendons.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> We recently reported that inflammatory signatures changed throughout different stages of severity in tissue samples from patients with supraspinatus tendinopathy.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> However, the mechanisms by which inflammation is perceived by resident tendon cells remains poorly understood.</p><p>Alarmins, endogenous molecules released on tissue damage, are key effectors in the activation of the immune system that may be important in the pathogenesis of tendon disease.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Alarmins are structurally diverse host proteins with intracellular or intra nuclear functions, which act in both host-defence and tissue repair.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> These molecules &#x02018;alarm&#x02019; the immune system by upregulating signalling pathways including nuclear factor-&#x003ba;&#x003b2; (NF-&#x003ba;&#x003b2;), interferons (IFNs) and cyclooxygenases, which have downstream effects on tendon repair processes.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Studies of alarmins in RA have implicated these molecules in the failure of acute inflammatory resolution, resulting in dysregulated processes and development of chronic inflammation.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> There is a paucity of research on alarmins in tendon disease.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20</xref> To our knowledge, no study has previously investigated alarmin protein expression in non-ruptured diseased supraspinatus tendons before and after treatment using tendon matched healthy control tissues. Moreover, there are little data regarding the potential roles of S100A9 and HMGB1 in tendinopathy.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to investigate expression of three&#x000a0;alarmins in human supraspinatus tendons that have been implicated in sustaining chronic inflammation in diseased musculoskeletal tissues: 1) S100A9 2) high-mobility group box&#x000a0;1 (HMGB1) and 3) interleukin-33 (IL-33).<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Although there is a growing list of alarmins in the literature, these are the most thoroughly studied and implicated in other musculoskeletal diseases yet have not been investigated in tendinopathy.

An additional objective was to identify the cell types expressing alarmins in diseased tendon tissues. We hypothesised that expression of S100A9, HMGB, IL-33 and HIF-1&#x003b1; would be increased in painful diseased compared with healthy tendons. We further hypothesised that macrophages and resident tendon cells in diseased tissues would express these proteins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Overview</title><p>Ethical approval for this study was granted by the local research ethics committee, Oxfordshire REC B references 10/H0402/24, 09/H0605/111 and South Central Oxford B reference 14/SC/0222. Full informed consent according to the Declaration of Helsinki was obtained from all patients. Tissue was obtained from three well-phenotyped patient groups: 1) 6 healthy supraspinatus tendons from patients undergoing shoulder stabilisation, 2) 13 diseased supraspinatus tendons (intact and not torn) from patients with shoulder pain undergoing SAD and 3) 5 pain-free post-treatment supraspinatus tendons from patients who previously had SAD surgery for shoulder impingement (tissue collected 1&#x02013;3&#x02009;years post-SAD). Samples were collected by a consultant orthopaedic surgeon during surgery (healthy and diseased) or under local anaesthetic (treated group). All patients included in the study completed the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS), a validated pain and functional outcome measure prior to tissue collection and/or surgery.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> All tissue samples were processed, embedded, sectioned and stained using immunohistochemistry (IHC) to quantify protein expression of S100A9, HMGB1, IL-33 and HIF-1&#x003b1;.

Samples of healthy supraspinatus tendon tissues were collected from patients recruited to the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre (NOC) from orthopaedic referral clinics for shoulder instability (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). During the surgical procedure a tendon biopsy was collected. Diseased supraspinatus tendon tissues were collected from patients presenting to orthopaedic referral clinics for shoulder pain. Patients presenting to the shoulder clinic had failed non-operative treatments and had experienced pain for a minimum of 6&#x02009;months. Tendon tissues were collected via ultrasound-guided biopsy prior to surgical subacromial decompression. The biopsy was taken using a Tru-Cut needle 5 to 10&#x02009;mm posterior to the anterior edge of the supraspinatus tendon. This validated biopsy technique is described in detail elsewhere.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Post-treatment pain-free supraspinatus tendon tissues were collected from patients who underwent the referral process for chronic shoulder pain/supraspinatus tendinopathy, had a SAD procedure and who were clinically asymptomatic for at least 1&#x02009;year after surgery. Patients in the pain-free group had significant pain before SAD that resolved post-treatment, evidenced by a post-treatment median OSS of 48 (range, 45&#x02013;48). Pain-free post-treatment samples were collected 1&#x02013;3&#x02009;years after treatment using a percutaneous ultrasound-guided biopsy technique under local anaesthetic.

Depending on expression pattern (cytoplasmic/nuclear or extracellular), specific algorithms were used to quantify immunostaining. For antibodies that showed nuclear and/or cytoplasmic staining, a cell ratio was calculated: positively stained cells/total cells (S100A9, HMGB1 and IL-33). Once positive cells and total cells were counted for each image, the results were summed for each sample to give total positive cells/total cells. For antibodies that showed staining of the extracellular matrix, a ratio of the stained area was calculated: stained area ratio = total positively stained pixels in the image/total pixels of the image (HIF-1&#x003b1;). Once positive pixels and total pixels were quantified for each image, the results were summed to give the stained area ratio: total number of stained pixels/total pixels of all images.

</p><p>HMGB1 has not been previously investigated in diseased human tendon tissues. We hypothesised that HMGB1 staining would be increased in diseased tissues due to its pro-inflammatory and pathogenic role in some musculoskeletal disorders. Contrary to our hypothesis, HMGB1 staining was reduced in diseased tendons compared with both healthy and pain-free post-treatment tendons. These findings suggest HMGB1 may have potential role in tendon repair and regeneration, analogous to reports of HMGB1 function in diseased cardiac muscle.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44&#x02013;46</xref>
</p><p>A limitation of this study was the relatively small number of patients studied in healthy and post-treatment groups. Also age-related changes may also contribute to differences in expression between healthy and diseased tendon tissues. Our healthy tendon samples were collected from younger patients and this may have influenced the findings from this study. A significant advantage of this study is the use of supraspinatus tendons in both the diseased and healthy control groups, avoiding any biological variations seen in tendons with different structure and function. Improving understanding of the role of alarmins in tendon disease will facilitate identification of potential therapeutic targets for patients with tendinopathy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, we found differential protein expression of alarmins in healthy and diseased human supraspinatus tendons, before and after treatment. Specifically, S100A9 and HIF-1&#x003b1; may have pro-inflammatory effects in tendon disease, nuclear IL-33 may be protective against pro-inflammatory stimuli and HMGB1 may have a potential role in tendon healing. The cell types expressing S100A9, IL-33 and HIF-1&#x003b1; included macrophages and tendon stromal cells. Pathological activation of tendon cells through alarmin involvement may sustain chronic inflammation in tendinopathy. We propose that tendinopathy is an alarmin-mediated pathology initiated and propagated in part by increased expression of HIF-1&#x003b1;. Alarmin activity may facilitate recruitment of inflammatory cells in the early stages of tendon disease.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> Study concept and design: MJM, SGD, AJC, SJBJ.</p><p>Acquisition of data: MJM, SGD.</p><p>Analysis and interpretation of data: MJM, SGD, SJBS, AJC.</p><p>Drafting of the manuscript: all authors.</p><p>Critical revision of the manuscript and approval of final version: all authors.</p><p>Statistical analysis: MJM, SGD.</p><p>Obtained funding: AJC.</p><p>Administrative, technical or material support: KW, BW.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> MJM acknowledges the Harvard University Francis H Burr, Class of 1909 Prize Fund and the National Collegiate Athletic Association for financial support.

"steal phenomenon" after coronary artery bypass grafting, besides being
occasionally used for myocardial revascularization. Its branches make
anastomoses with the internal thoracic artery through lateral intercostal
arteries. We aim to report, on three cases, the clinical significance of a
well-developed lateral costal artery after coronary artery bypass grafting. Two
out of three patients who underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery in our
center between June 2010 and August 2017, applied to us with stable angina
pectoris, while the third one was diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome after
applying to the emergency department. In coronary cineangiography, in all three
cases, a well-developed accessory vessel arising from the proximal 2.5 cm
segment of the left internal thoracic artery coursed as far as the
6<sup>th</sup> rib was detected, and it was confirmed to be the lateral
costal artery. A stable angina pectoris in two of the patients was thought to be
the result of steal phenomenon caused by the well-developed lateral costal
artery. In the two cases with stable angina pectoris the lateral costal artery
was obliterated via coil embolization. In the other case with the proximal left
anterior descending artery stenosis, before percutaneous coronary intervention,
the lateral costal artery was obliterated via coil embolization and the occluded
subclavian artery was stented. Routine visualization in cineangiography and
satisfactory surgical exploration of the left internal thoracic artery could be
very helpful to identify any possible accessory branch of the left internal
thoracic artery like the lateral costal artery.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Mammary Arteries</kwd><kwd>Subclavian Steal Syndrome</kwd><kwd>Thoracic Wall/blood supply</kwd><kwd>Internal Mammary-Coronary Artery Anastomosis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="15%" span="1"/><col width="1%" span="1"/><col width="85%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="3" style="background-color:#eaeaea" rowspan="1">Abbreviations,

called it the lateral internal thoracic artery (LITA)<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. The famous anatomist
Henle described it further as "arising from the internal thoracic near its entrance
into the thorax and descending on the inner surface of four to six upper ribs and
anastomosing with the corresponding intercostal arteries". In the same study, its
risky location in terms of thoracentesis and various surgical procedures was also
underlined<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. Lateral costal artery (LCA) rises as a first branch
of the LITA in 92% of the population. It is present 5.5% bilaterally and 11.1%
unilaterally<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. The mean distance between internal thoracic artery
origin and lateral costal branch origin is 2.3 cm and 2.9 cm on the right and left
side of the anterior thoracic wall, respectively. Mean diameter of the LCA is found
to be 1.74&#x000b1;0.8 mm<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. It has sometimes been identified as culprit for the
"steal phenomenon" after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and the artery
itself is occasionally used for myocardial revascularization<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. Embryologically, this
artery, like the normal parietal arteries of the trunk, might form a longitudinal
channel connecting the intersegmental arteries<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In spite of advanced surgical techniques, it's not possible to improve LITA
exploration to divide all its side branches. Ligation of the 1<sup>st</sup>
intercostal and more proximal branches of the LITA, which have superiority in left
ventricular revascularization with 1A level of evidence, is of great importance to
prevent "steal phenomenon". It's reported that non-ligated side branch frequency in
coronary angiographies performed in patients who underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting (CABG) is between 9-25%<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>CASES</title><p>Case 1: 65-year-old female patient, underwent triple CABG three months ago, applied
to us with angina pectoris appearing after 50-100 m of walking. She had been under
medical treatment of acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg and metoprolol 100 mg. Effort test
of the patient whose physical examination and resting electrocardiography (ECG) were
normal unveiled ST depression (<xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).
Coronary angiography performed in the patient revealed a well-developed LITA side
branch at a distance of 2-2.5 cm from the origin of LITA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). The accessory branch, being one and a half times the
diameter of LITA, was extending to the lateral thoracic wall, where it was making
anastomoses with lateral intercostal arteries and thus supplying blood to anterior
and posterior side of the lateral thoracic wall. It was detected that this accessory
thoracic artery, the LCA, was stealing a large part of the myocardial blood flow to
lateral thoracic wall. The LCA was obliterated via coil embolization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). The patient's effort capacity had
improved and no ST segment change was observed in the effort test performed one
month after the coil embolization of the lateral costal artery.</p><table-wrap id="t1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographic characteristics of the cases.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="all"><colgroup span="1"><col width="25%" span="1"/><col width="25%" span="1"/><col width="25%" span="1"/><col width="25%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.Case</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.Case</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.Case</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hemoglobin (g/dL)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Enzymes (U/ml)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ALT=67<break/>Other values present<break/>no

</p><p>Case 2: 56-year-old female patient expressed unstable angina pectoris and dyspnea
within the first week after CABG. Transthoracic ECG revealed left ventricular free
wall motion abnormality and 1-2 mitral valve regurgitation. Ejection fraction was
30-35% (<xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Coronary angiography was
performed in the patient who has been under medical treatment for diabetes mellitus
for 15 years. It exposed the LCA which arose from the LITA at a distance of 2-2.5 cm
from the origin of LITA. It was extending to the 6<sup>th</sup> intercostal space
and was two thirds the diameter of the LITA. It was postulated that the LCA had
aggravated the steal phenomenon, therefore it was obliterated via coil embolization.
After LCA obliteration, the patient's angina disappeared, but dyspnea persisted.
Since she had advanced restrictive lung disease, she referred to a pulmonologist
with medical treatment comprising of acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg, metoprolol 100 mg,
spironolactone 50 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg.</p><p>Case 3: 71-year-old male patient, underwent triple CABG one month ago, applied to our
emergency department with unstable angina pectoris. His ECG record displayed ST
segment elevation and troponin-T value was measured 0.45 ng/ml (<xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In primary percutaneous coronary
intervention, it was detected that the left subclavian artery (SCA) was proximally
occluded, the LITA graft was patent, and there was a LITA side branch, thought to be
the LCA, which was one third the diameter of the LITA. The LCA was extending to the
6<sup>th</sup> rib and making anastomoses with intercostal arteries. First,
balloon angioplasty was performed in the left SCA. Then, the lesion causing 80% left
anterior descending artery (LAD) stenosis was stented. After that, the LCA was
obliterated via coil embolization. Finally, the left SCA was stented. Stent placed
in the SCA also occluded the LITA ostium inadvertently. The patient, being
hemodynamically stable, was discharged from the hospital a week after admission with
a medical treatment comprising of acetylsalicylic acid mg and metoprolol 100 mg. In
follow-up visits, cardiac parameters have been found to be normal.</p><p>In our institution, LITA flow measurement is done by intraoperative free-bleeding
technique. LITA is harvested and explored using electrocautery and metallic clips.
Topical application of 0.2% papaverin solution at 37&#x000ba;C is routinely done to prevent
LITA spams. In the free-bleeding technique, the harvested LITA graft, before any
balloon dilatation or topical papaverin application, is let to freely bleed from the
distal end to a measuring cylinder for a minute while the heart rate and arterial
tension are within normal limits. After measuring the total volume of blood in the
cylinder, LITA graft with flow of 30 ml/min or more is considered to be proper for
bypass grafting (<xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The LITA, in 92% of the cases, arises from the first part of the left subclavian
artery opposite to thyrocervical trunk 2 cm above the sternal end of the clavicle.
In 7% of the cases it arises from the 2<sup>nd</sup> part of the left subclavian
artery, whereas in 1% of the cases it does from the 3<sup>rd</sup>
part<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. In 70% of the cases, the LITA rises directly from
the left subclavian artery while in the remaining 30% it originates from the left
subclavian artery as a component of a common trunk with other
arteries<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. After its origin from the left subclavian artery it
extends on left anterior thoracic wall for 1.5 cm and 5.4 cm lateral to the sternum
at the levels of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> ribs, respectively. The LITA
gives pericardiophrenic, thymic, sternal, anterior intercostal and perforating
branches through its course to the abdominal wall over the posterior surface of the
first six ribs. It divides into musculophrenic and superior epigastric arteries at
the 6<sup>th</sup> intercostal space. In the cases we present, the LITA was
originating from the first part of the left SCA and coursing in its natural route.
Its mean diameter was 2-2.5 mm (<xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).
Perioperative manual flow measurements indicated a mean flow of 45-56 ml/min (<xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Tough flow and size parameters were
in normal limits, the steal phenomenon seen after LAD-LITA anastomoses was ascribed
to myocardial vascular resistance directing the LITA flow toward the LCA. Calafiore
et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> in
a study comparing 150 patients with left anterior thoracotomy to 150 patients with
median sternotomy, reported the same rates of undivided lateral costal artery
contrary to expectations, [15 (10%) and 17 (11.3%), respectively]. In the same
study, rate of presence of undivided both 1<sup>st</sup> intercostal artery and
branches less than 1 mm in diameter were found to be significantly higher in
thoracotomy group. These results indicate that the choice of incision could limit
the access to smaller diameter branches but not to the LCA<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>. In a study comprising
262 patients who underwent CABG, Bauer et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> found that the LITA has large side
branches in 9% of the cases and has atypical location in 1% of the
cases<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. The undivided LITA branches, when detected, must be
obliterated since they, in direct proportion to diameter and location, reduce LITA
flow. In a study comprising 38 patients with angina pectoris after CABG,
Bi&#x000e7;ero&#x0011f;lu et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> detected undivided LITA branches of varying
diameter and length in 7 (18.4%) patients. Most of the side branches were found to
be located at proximal parts of the LITA<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>. Visualization of the left SCA and the
LITA before CABG is of utmost importance in the prevention of postoperative angina
pectoris and myocardial infarction resulting from steal phenomenon. Otherwise, like
in the cases we present, limited exploration of the LITA could result in serious
complications.</p><p>A study conducted on cadavers demonstrated that the LCA shows variation at the
proximal part of the LITA (15%)<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. It could be present unilaterally or
bilaterally, and it has a diameter close to the LITA. The same study pointed out the
increased possibility of steal phenomenon due to these side branches in case the
LITA was used as a vascular graft for the coronary
revascularization<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. Henriquez-Pino et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> showed that the LITA
arises directly from the left SCA in 70% of the cadavers and that the internal
thoracic artery gives LAC branch more distally on the left side. Other arteries
accompanying the LCA at the proximal part of the LITA are the suprascapular artery,
transverse cervical artery, inferior thyroidal artery, and ascending cervical
artery. In the all three cases we present, the LCAs of varying diameter were
anastomosing with lateral intercostal arteries. We have detected the undivided LCA
in only three cases within seven years. In a long period of follow-up, due to
probability of existence of asymptomatic patients and symptomatic patients applying
to other institutions, the exact rate of prevalence of undivided LCA for our center
couldn't be determined. In one of our cases, a female with breast-feeding history,
LCA diameter was greater than the LITA diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). After evaluating the coronary angiographies of 103 patients
who underwent CABG surgery, Sutherland et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> found that the LCA was present in 30
(29%) patients, either unilaterally or bilaterally. They showed that 25 of these
were extending to the 2<sup>nd</sup> intercostal space, while the remaining 5
extended to the 5<sup>th</sup> intercostal space.</p><p>Considering its invasive nature and potential complications, we abstained from
postoperative intracoronary flow measurement. As for less invasive methods like
myocardial perfusion scintigraphy, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission
tomography and transesophageal echocardiography, we faced problems regarding
availability, cost, and radiation exposure. Transthoracic Doppler echocardiography
is commonly used for the coronary and LITA blood flow measurements. As a result of
suboptimal image quality in postoperative patient, only in the first case we were
able to measure the coronary blood flow (45 cm/sn) via transthoracic Doppler
echocardiography. Therefore, clinical findings and negative effort ECG were used as
criteria in follow-up.</p><p>In the cases with inadequate surgical exploration of the LITA, great side branches
could be passed over. LITA visualization absent in angiography could also lead to
insufficient exploration of the LITA side branches. Mostly, the steal phenomenon
caused by undivided LITA side branches is tried to be overcome by increasing the
intensity of medical therapy, but it must be brought to mind that the presence of
the LCA might be the reason for post-CABG angina.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Considering the prevalence of LCA and undivided LCA seen after CABG, in patients
planned to undergo CABG, preoperative visualization of the left SCA and proximal
part of the LITA is of paramount importance. Doing this could significantly lower
the probability of serious postoperative complications.</p><table-wrap id="t3" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="5%" span="1"/><col width="95%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1"><bold>Authors&#x02019; roles &#x00026;

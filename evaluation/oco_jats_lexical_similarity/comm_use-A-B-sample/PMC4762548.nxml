2015 aimed at celebrating its 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary in 2016. The most important
ones were the adoption of English as the official language and the change of periodicity
from quarterly to bimonthly, with two more regular annual editions. Every transition
brings expectations, but despite the difficulties that crop up during this process, I
believe we can follow the path without too many mishaps, thanks to the efforts of the
Editorial Board, Associate Editors, Editorial Council and staff and Board of Directors
of the Brazilian Society of Cardiovascular Surgery (BSCVS) which gave essential support
for us to begin and continue this process.</p><p>We have removed the rest of the content in Portuguese still present in the magazine
(title, abstract and key words and name in Portuguese - Revista Brasileira de Cirurgia
Cardiovascular) since the volume 30.5, making it definitely a periodical only in
English. I repeat that English is the official language of science in the world and if
we want to become part of the mainstream of scientific communication, the required
standards must be followed.</p><p>Our website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bjcvs.org/">www.bjcvs.org</ext-link>) is also undergoing revision and updating in order to be
more interactive and "friendly", facilitating the process of submission and review of
the manuscripts. We intend to make it more attractive and, therefore, glean new readers
and authors interested in submitting their manuscripts.</p><p>Let's celebrate our 30 years of uninterrupted publications and services provided to the
Brazilian cardiovascular surgery and related fields the way this date deserves it. The
43<sup>rd</sup> Congress of the BSCVS, to be held April 7-9 in Fortaleza, CE,
Brazil, will have part of its programming dedicated to the BJCVS, and certainly will
please the participants with whom we will gladly share our 30<sup>th</sup> year
anniversary celebration.</p><p>In all 2016 issues, we are going to publish comments of Directors of the BSCVS,
Departments and its Members, as well as all of our Editorial Board and BSCVS partners
who wish to contribute their exegesis regarding this significant date.</p><sec><title>THE REASON WHY WE CELEBRATE 30 YEARS OF EXISTANCE</title><p>"A bit more than one hundred years ago, early last century, the life expectancy of
Brazilians was merely 30 years. The average was pulled down by infant mortality and
diseases for which there was no treatment at that time, such as typhoid fever,
yellow fever, tuberculosis, leprosy, etc.</p><p>The corporate world has a remarkable resemblance to this picture. A survey carried
out by the Instituto Brasileiro de Planejamento Tribut&#x000e1;rio (Brazilian
Institute of Tax Planning - BIPT) exclusively for Revista &#x000c9;poca
Neg&#x000f3;cios reveals that companies often become extinct when they are about 30
years old!" The BJCVS is going through this critical phase renewing itself every
issue.</p><p>Freely adapted from the article: "Por que as empresas vivem t&#x000e3;o pouco?" "Why
do companies live so little?" (Title in English)<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> [Marcelo Cabral, Revista &#x000c9;poca Neg&#x000f3;cios]

</p></sec><sec><title>ECMO</title><p>Among the articles in this issue, approaching various aspects of our specialty, I
highlight "ECMO: Improving our Results by Chasing the Rabbits" (page 657), by Dr.
Luiz Fernando Can&#x000ea;o and Dr. Rodolfo Neirotti. The authors brilliantly
describe the benefits of using this device, created 37 years ago, but little use in
Latin American countries, including Brazil. They also show the work of the
Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) to compile global data on the use of
ECMO and support the training of multidisciplinary teams in using this equipment,
valuable for saving lives.</p><p>Also showing the difficulties in the use of ECMO in Brazil, we published the letter
of Dr. Helmgton Souza, titled "Circulatory Assistance: the Challenges of
Technological Incorporation in Brazil" (page 676). He highlights the delay to
implement the new medical technologies in our country due to barriers imposed,
citing the example of ECMO, still considered "experimental", bringing a number of
limitations to professionals who intend to use it. Dr. Souza encourages those
involved in the issue to engage in dialogue, so that the technologies can be
incorporated into the daily routines.</p></sec><sec><title>CME</title><p>In this BJCVS issue, the following articles are available to test the Continuing
Medical Education (CME): "<italic>Effects of Cardiopulmonary Bypass on Mediastinal
Drainage and the Use of Blood Products in the Intensive Care Unit in 60- to
80-Year-Old Patients Who Have Undergone Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting" (page
597); "Application of Mechanical Ventilation Weaning Predictors After Elective
Cardiac Surgery" (page 605); "Alternative Physical Therapy Protocol Using a
Cycle Ergometer During Hospital Rehabilitation of Coronary Artery Bypass
Grafting: a Clinical Trial" (page 615) and "Efficacy Analysis of a Script-based
Guide for EVAR Execution: is It Possible to Reduce Patient Exposure to Contrast,
Operative Time and Blood Loss even when Advanced Technologies are not
Available?" (page 650).</italic></p><p>It's important to remember that 29.4 - 30.3 issue tests will be worth up to 5 points
for the Specialist Title in 2016. The vouchers should be sent via email to the BSCVS
until February 12, 2016. More information can be obtained by accessing the link:</p><p>

accessed on devices (smartphones, tablets, etc.) using Android and iOS systems.
In addition to that, in order to seek greater visibility, we are also present on
Facebook and Twitter for short notes, respectively:</p><p>

</p><p>These social media sites always bring news of our magazine, as well as cardiac
surgery themes and scientific publications in general.</p><p>I draw readers' attention to the importance of collaboration of all, so that
these media are accessed and, furthermore, that can be a meeting point to
disseminate ideas and suggestions.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>BSCVS</title><p>I will take advantage of this great opportunity to congratulate the Board of the 2014
- 2015 BSCVS, chaired by Dr. Marcelo Matos Cascudo, who spared no effort to enhance
our specialty and materialize the old dream of having its own headquarter, wider,
with the possibility to implement refresher courses for cardiovascular surgeons,
keeping us updated on the state-of-theart surgical procedures.</p><p>I wish good luck to those who will conduct our Society in the biennium 2016-2017, led
by Dr. Fabio Jatene<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>, currently
Full Professor of Cardiovascular Surgery at Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de
S&#x000e3;o Paulo, and Director of the Cardiovascular Surgery Division at Instituto
do Cora&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o, in S&#x000e3;o Paulo, SP, Brazil, a very competent
colleague with merits already proven in multiple activities. He has been part of the
BSCVS for many years, having occupied almost all Board positions, besides being the
Editor-in-Chief of the BJCVS, preceded by the unforgettable Prof. Adib
Jatene<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>I thank BSCVS, advertisers and partners for believing in BJCVS, enabling our work to
be developed this year, despite the immense difficulties that our country is
experiencing with consequences for all sectors of society.</p><p>I insist on being optimistic and believe that the strength of the good citizens, who
live in Brazil, will be greater than the crisis and this will hopefully get us back
on track. We recall the lesson of our patron, the late Professor Zerbini, whom we
all miss so dearly: "Nothing resists the work<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>." So we will win!</p><p>May Christmas renew our hopes and a Happy 2016 to all of us!</p></sec><sig-block><sig>Editor-in-Chief<break/>BJCVS<break/>E-mail: domingo@braile.com.br</sig></sig-block></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cabral</surname><given-names>Marcelo</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Por que as empresas vivem t&#x000e3;o pouco?</article-title><source>Revista &#x000c9;poca Neg&#x000f3;cios</source><month>1</month><year>2014</year><date-in-citation content-type="access-date">2015 Dec 12</date-in-citation><comment>Available from: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://goo.gl/jlMdeI">http://goo.gl/jlMdeI</ext-link></comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="r2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jatene</surname><given-names>FB</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Editorial</article-title><source>Rev Bras Cir Cardiovasc</source><year>1996</year><volume>11</volume><issue>2</issue><fpage>I</fpage><lpage>I</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="r3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Braile</surname><given-names>DM</given-names></name><name><surname>Buffolo</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Adib Jatene: June 4, 1929 - November 14, 2014</article-title><source>Rev Bras Cir Cardiovasc</source><year>2014</year><volume>29</volume><issue>4</issue><fpage>473</fpage><lpage>477</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">25714198</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="r4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Stolf</surname><given-names>NAG</given-names></name><name><surname>Braile</surname><given-names>DM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Euryclides de Jesus Zerbini: a biography</article-title><source>Rev Bras Cir Cardiovasc</source><year>2012</year><volume>27</volume><issue>1</issue><fpage>137</fpage><lpage>147</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22729312</pub-id></element-citation></ref></ref-list></back></article>

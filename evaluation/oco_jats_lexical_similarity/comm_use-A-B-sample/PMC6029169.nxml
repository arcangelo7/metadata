It has enabled researchers to produce scaffolds with intricate porous geometries that were not feasible with traditional manufacturing processes. Researchers can control the structural geometry through a wide range of customisable printing parameters and design choices including material, print path, temperature, and many other process parameters. Currently, the impact of these choices is not fully understood. This review focuses on how the position and orientation of extruded filaments, which&#x000a0;sometimes referred to as the print path, lay-down pattern, or simply &#x0201c;scaffold design&#x0201d;, affect scaffold properties and biological performance. By analysing trends across multiple studies, new understanding was developed on how filament position affects mechanical properties. Biological performance was also found to be affected by filament position, but a lack of consensus between studies indicates a need for further research and understanding. In most research studies, scaffold design was dictated by capabilities of additive manufacturing software rather than free-form design of structural geometry optimised for biological requirements. There is scope for much greater application of engineering innovation to additive manufacture novel geometries. To achieve this, better understanding of biological requirements is needed to enable the effective specification of ideal scaffold geometries.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Fused deposition modelling</kwd><kwd>Bioprinting</kwd><kwd>3D printing</kwd><kwd>Scaffold architecture</kwd><kwd>Tissue engineering constructs</kwd><kwd>Regenerative medicine</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par3">Worldwide, approximately 230 million major surgical procedures are performed on a daily basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Most of these procedures involve reconstruction, repair, or replacement of one or more damaged tissues or organs. Tissue engineering in combination with additive manufacturing has emerged as an alternative technique to regenerate damaged tissues and organs by developing patient-specific substitutes that restore, improve, or maintain tissue function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Engineering of functional tissues or organs requires a scaffold, which acts as a template for tissue regeneration. Additive manufacturing can help build such a template in a layer-by-layer fashion and is particularly appropriate for reconstructive surgery for facial trauma because scaffolds with patient-specific anatomical geometries can be fabricated. Currently, materials that facilitate bone ingrowth are widely used in reconstructive surgery for the treatment of trauma, but tissue engineering scaffolds will see more widespread clinical usage as research and clinical translation continues.</p><p id="Par4">One of the most common additive manufacturing technologies for tissue engineering scaffolds is material extrusion additive manufacturing, in which a variety of materials can be extruded including polymers, hydrogels, and ceramic pastes. For thermoplastics, the process is also known as fused deposition modelling (FDM). During material extrusion additive manufacturing, filaments are extruded from a nozzle and positioned relative to one another according to a pattern chosen by the user. Complex geometries and porous structures can be achieved with a fully interconnected network of pores, which is not possible with conventional fabrication techniques such as injection moulding or machining. Porosity is especially important in scaffold design because it allows blood vessel ingrowth, nutrient diffusion, oxygen transport, and waste removal, which are important factors for the regeneration of fully functional tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">In 2015, Gariboldi and Best [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] introduced four levels of geometry for tissue engineering scaffolds: (1) surface topography, (2) pore size and geometry, (3) porous networks, and (4) macroscopic pore arrangement, including the potential for functionally gradient structural geometry. Whilst the first level relates to surface features of 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m more&#x000a0;or less, and is typically dictated by material choice and processing method, the other three levels are all primarily dependent on the scaffold geometry, which is dictated by the position and orientation of filaments. Here, the term &#x0201c;position and orientation of filaments&#x0201d; refers to the physical geometric placement of filaments within a scaffold relative to one another, for example, the angular orientation of filaments on different layers or the spacing between filaments. These aspects of scaffold geometry can be varied independently of the design of the overall external scaffold geometry.</p><p id="Par6">Hutmacher first reported the use of additive manufacturing for tissue engineering scaffolds in 2000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. His group produced scaffold designs with several filament orientations. Since then, extensive research has investigated different designs for scaffold geometry and the effect on tissue formation. Many features of scaffold geometry can be controlled by the position and orientation of filaments, including pore volume fraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], pore size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], pore shape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], mechanical properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and functional gradients of these properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. These are all important factors for tissue engineering scaffolds. Importantly, several studies have shown that scaffold geometry affects biological responses including cell seeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and tissue formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">This review identifies how the position and orientation of filaments, which also referred to in the literature as print path, lay-down pattern, or &#x0201c;scaffold design&#x0201d;, affect the porosity, mechanical properties, and biological performance of tissue engineering scaffolds produced by material extrusion additive manufacturing. First, an overview of material extrusion additive manufacturing technology and software is given.

For the reproduction of patient-specific anatomical geometries, however, the free-form nature of&#x000a0;additive manufacturing processes makes them&#x000a0;more appropriate. A wide range of additive manufacturing processes have been reviewed elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The present review focuses on material extrusion additive manufacturing, in which material is extruded through a nozzle.</p><p id="Par10">A wide range of materials, with a vast range of properties, have been used for additive manufacturing tissue engineering scaffolds including metals, ceramics, polymers, natural materials, and composites.

Most commercial bioprinters use several different combinations of these extrusion technologies. They are capable of printing living cells in combination with various biomaterials for tissue fabrication.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Three different types of extruders are illustrated schematically. <bold>a</bold> Filament-fed extruder. <bold>b</bold> Screw extruder. <bold>c</bold> Syringe extruders with either a mechanically driven plunger or pneumatic pressure plunger</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41038_2018_121_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Filament-fed extruders</title><p id="Par12">Filament-fed additive manufacturing systems use reels of polymer filaments that typically have a diameter of 1.75 or 2.85&#x000a0;mm. These filaments are fed into a heated melting chamber which is attached to the nozzle. The rate of material extrusion from the nozzle is directly dictated by the rate at which filament is fed off the reels into the melting chamber, due to fundamental principles of volume conservation. Additive manufacturing software controls the extrusion rate based on the desired diameter of extruded filaments and the speed at which the nozzle is moving. This is the most common extrusion method for material extrusion additive manufacturing due to the low hardware costs and capability for a wide range of polymer melting temperatures. A major drawback of a filament-fed approach is that material options are limited to those that can be purchased in filament form.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Screw extruders</title><p id="Par13">In screw extrusion additive manufacturing systems, polymer granules are fed into a screw that is surrounded by a close-fitting sleeve, called a barrel. As the screw rotates, molten polymer is forced through the nozzle at the end of the barrel. The rate of material extrusion from the nozzle is dictated by the screw rotation speed. The increased complexity of hardware for this extrusion method results in greater costs versus filament-fed printers. In addition to polymer granules, screw extruders can accommodate materials in paste form although this is less common.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Syringe extruders</title><p id="Par14">In syringe extrusion additive manufacturing systems, the material is placed into a syringe and the printer depresses the plunger at a controlled rate to extrude filaments. Syringes are typically filled with a viscous material such as a hydrogel. Thermosoftening polymer granules may be used if a heated jacket heats the syringe to melt the polymer granules in situ before printing. Polycaprolactone has a low melting point (&#x02248;&#x02009;60&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) so is ideal for typical syringes, although other polymers with higher melting points (e.g. &#x0003e;&#x02009;200&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) are feasible with stainless steel or glass syringes.</p><p id="Par15">There are two main types of syringe extrusion systems: those which apply pneumatic pressure to the plunger and those which depress it by mechanical displacement with an electric motor. A key difference between these two methods is that mechanical displacement allows for more direct control over the volumetric extrusion rate (mm<sup>3</sup>/s) whereas in pneumatic printers, the extrusion rate depends on a complex interplay between needle geometry, material viscosity, pneumatic pressure, and obstruction by previously extruded filaments. In relation to the scope of this review, theoretically, more controlled filament geometries and scaffold structures may be achieved with mechanical plunger displacement due to the more direct control over extrusion rate. The benefit of pneumatic systems is that the forces applied to the material are known, which is important when considering shear stress in cell-laden hydrogels.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Multiple extruders</title><p id="Par16">Bioprinters typically include several different extruders in one machine so that multiple materials can be printed during a single fabrication process. This is useful for co-printing scaffolds with cell-laden hydrogels and to create tissues that consist of multiple cell types and materials. Multiple materials may also be used to achieve gradient structures with a gradual transition from one material to another.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Additive manufacturing software</title><p id="Par17">Each additive manufactured system is supplied with its own software, and the capabilities vary greatly among different manufacturers. Traditional filament-fed systems for general engineering applications are typically supplied with software focused on achieving a high-quality surface finish for a wide range of part geometries. These softwares provide numerous options to control the internal structure, referred to as the infill, which consists of sparse filaments that provide mechanical integrity whilst minimising polymer usage, printing time, and part weight. However, they do not generally allow direct control over individual filaments. Software supplied with bioprinters is more focused on controlling the microscale geometry of scaffold pores and may enable precise positioning and material selection for each individual filament by allowing the user to manually draw the print path electronically within the software (e.g. BioCAD, regenHU Villaz-St-Pierre, Switzerland) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Due to the needs of clinical applications, bioprinter softwares are also suitable for complex anatomic geometries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">For many material extrusion additive manufacturing systems, third-party software such as Slic3r [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] or CAD/CAM packages such as PrimCAM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] can be used, as demonstrated by Schuurman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] for a polymeric scaffold with multiple hydrogels in a single construct. However, third-party software can only be used if the machine control code (GCODE) is not of a proprietary format and if the system allows custom GCODE to be uploaded to the machine.</p><p id="Par19">Due to the highly individual nature of tissue engineering scaffolds and widely varying scope of research studies, it is not feasible for additive manufacturing software to include the infinite potential parameters that may be desired for print path generation and overall process control. Therefore, some institutions have developed customised in-house software to generate print paths and GCODE, as in the studies of Jung et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], Kang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and Ruiz-Cantu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Jung et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] developed an algorithm for generating print paths for heterogeneous cell-laden hydrogel scaffolds with free-form 3D geometry, as outlined in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> (a). A key aim of their software was to effectively and intuitively accommodate a range of materials as shown in the print path for a single layer in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> (b). Kang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] also developed custom software to print multiple materials with specifically designed spatial distributions to achieve several 3D tissue structures, and some authors of this review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] developed custom software to achieve different filament orientations near to the external surface of scaffolds versus the centre to improve control over pore size. As clinical translation continues, it will be important to ensure that software for additive manufacturing systems is suitable for practitioners to use or is able to effectively implement any requirements stated by practitioners.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>A custom print path generation algorithm was developed by Jung et al.

Pores are typically shown in images portraying top-down views or side views of scaffolds. This enables pore shape and size to be effectively quantified. However, it may be more appropriate to consider the scaffold to contain a single interconnected pore with filaments running through it, resulting in a highly complex but repeatable pore geometry, as illustrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. The cross-sectional images on the right-hand side of Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> illustrate how the pore has a constantly changing complex geometry.

For scaffolds with a 0/90 filament orientation, porosity could be considered as a series of long intersecting columnar pores. For a 0/60/120 filament orientation, however, pores may more closely resemble the geometry of a spiral staircase. Such differences between 3D pore shapes are difficult to communicate with static images, and 2D analysis is currently the most accepted approach for scientific reporting. However, recent publications lean towards an increased use of supporting data and the inclusion of 3D models with scientific articles, which may facilitate more complex morphological analysis of pores in the future.

The surface area of the scaffold was found to be important along with the configuration of filaments and its impact on flow conditions of the cell suspension during dynamic seeding. In scaffolds with aligned filaments, in which pores ran directly from top to bottom of the scaffold, the cell suspension may have travelled through relatively quickly and thus not facilitated effective cell attachment. Cell seeding efficiency increased in scaffolds with staggered filaments, potentially because the cell suspension had to continuously change direction as it passed through the scaffold. The authors hypothesised that this led to a slow flow rate and increased opportunity for cell attachment. Their results show that even when many aspects of the scaffold design are kept constant, the orientation and layout of filaments are critically important for biological performance. Similarly, Lee et al.

Although microstereolithography was used as the fabrication process by Lee et al.

Laronda et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] varied filament orientation in gelatin scaffolds to optimise pore geometries for murine follicle survival and function. They found follicles to demonstrate a better survival rate when they contacted multiple filaments (i.e. residing in the corner between filaments). Follicles contacted a greater number of filaments on average in scaffolds with 0/30/60/90/120 or 0/60/120 orientation versus a 0/90 orientation, and therefore, these scaffold designs achieved an improved survival rate. From these data, it can be concluded that the effect of filament orientation on cell proliferation varies considerably in the literature.

Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref> shows the strategy used by Yuk and Zhao [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]: by setting a low extrusion rate relative to nozzle speed, the filament was stretched to be narrower than the nozzle diameter, whereas setting a high extrusion rate caused the filament to either widen or fold on itself (&#x0201c;coiling&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;accumulation&#x0201d; in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>) depending on how far the nozzle was from the print bed. The authors suggested that innovations and applications of material extrusion additive manufacturing have been severely hampered by the limitations of typical deposition strategies. Takahashi and Miyashita [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] also undertook a detailed study varying the extrusion rate and height of the nozzle but for polylactide as opposed to a silicone hydrogel.

The user-friendly attributes of additive manufacturing software have enabled significant research over the last decade. However, the true capabilities of additive manufacturing systems are being under-utilised because it is unfeasible for generic software supplied by system manufacturers to fully address the wide-ranging needs of all researchers (the number of software parameters would become impractical). Therefore, in a few cases, custom software has been developed to offer more precise control over specific aspects of the additive manufacturing nozzle position and print path&#x02014;for example, to enable precise placement of different cell-laden hydrogels in tissue constructs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]&#x02014;but this is uncommon, and the custom software typically shares many similarities with off-the-shelf software. Fundamentally, a material extrusion additive manufacturing system is simply a robot that can place material in a chosen position, and there is a wide scope for entirely new and novel structures to be produced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. For example, by carefully designing the arrangement of filaments, auxetic scaffolds could be fabricated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], which would provide extremely different mechanical stress conditions for cells (versus regular scaffolds) and replicate the auxetic properties of some natural tissues including the skin, bone, and endothelium tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. In addition to experimental developments, computational models should also be developed, for example, to simulate the geometry and properties of tissue engineering scaffolds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Engineers and medical biological researchers must continue to collaborate, and custom software should be shared if possible (e.g. as supplementary information with journal publications).</p><p id="Par46">New additive manufacturing capabilities (machine hardware and software) can be readily developed, but this requires further research to understand the relationship between scaffold geometry and the complex biological requirements of tissue regeneration. This research will inform engineers of ideal scaffold geometries and direct future engineering developments in additive manufacturing. Even though knowledge of the complex extracellular matrix, in terms of design and geometry, of many tissues and organs currently exists, the requirements to recreate this complex matrix are not fully understood. For example, the overall structure and design of ear cartilage extracellular matrix is known: the tissue consists of a dense collagen, elastin, and glycosaminoglycans matrix, with chondrocytes embedded in lacunae. However, the effect of the structure of this matrix on cellular behaviour is not yet known. Therefore, designing a scaffold structure that recapitulates the influence of this matrix cannot be achieved at present. Some advanced printing capabilities have been developed, such as gradient structures, but through engineering collaboration, there is huge potential to use additive manufacturing systems in more advanced and more customised ways. In many cases, this only requires adapted additive manufacturing software, not hardware modification, such as non-constant filament width, variable layer thickness, curved layers, and highly controlled filament orientations. These, and many other, parameters are currently not being controlled in tissue engineering scaffolds&#x02014;likely because other parameters that can be more easily varied are still not fully understood in terms of their impact on biological performance. It is also important to relate these parameters to the requirements of the implant, as requested by practitioners on an individual-patient basis.</p><p id="Par47">Whilst several studies have considered the effect of filament position and orientation on cell seeding and proliferation, few consider longer-term performance, and therefore, optimisation of the scaffold design for tissue formation is not yet possible. The lack of such studies is probably due to the complexity and expense of long-term in vitro and in vivo studies. By contrast, mechanical characterisation can be completed relatively quickly with low costs; hence, the large number of studies are reviewed above in the &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec12" ref-type="sec">Effect of scaffold geometry on mechanical properties</xref>&#x0201d; section, although the analysis of anisoptropic mechanical properties (not widely studied) will become more critical going forwards because multi-directional stresses must be sustained in many clinical applications. The immune response to different print paths has not been studied as far as the authors are aware, although it is feasible for additive manufacturing to control certain factors that influence bacterial attachment and biofilm formation, as well as modulate localised immune responses. For example, optimising scaffold architectural parameters can prevent bacterial colonisation and reduce the risk of implant rejection due to infection or inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Similarly, degradation and resorption of scaffolds have not been extensively researched and require further investigation, particularly in combination with tissue formation and maturation. As cell seeding and proliferation studies develop more comprehensive understandings of the effect of geometry on biological requirements and responses, there will be greater justification to undertake long-term in vitro or in vivo studies. Since few long-term studies directly compare multiple printing strategies or print paths, it is important that systematic reviews and meta-analyses are undertaken to draw confident understanding across multiple studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par48">This paper identified current research into the effect of additive manufactured scaffold geometry on porosity, mechanical properties, and biological performance. It focused on the position and orientation of filaments, also referred to as the lay-down pattern or print path. Analysis of multiple comparable studies enabled new understanding of how mechanical properties are affected by the alignment of filaments across multiple additive manufactured layers. No general consensus was found regarding the optimal scaffold geometries for biological performance, indicating a need for further research with a medical biology focus. Current research studies have considered a relatively narrow range of scaffold geometries: typically, filaments of a constant size are arranged in a regular repeating manner over sequential layers. This is because most bioprinting software packages have similar capabilities. There is great potential for new advanced polymer-deposition strategies, with custom additive manufacturing software, to create novel scaffold structures that more effectively mimic the native tissue environment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Funding</title><p>This study was funded through employment at the authors&#x02019; institutions, as indicated in the author affiliations.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>AG and DV were responsible for the conception and design of the review.

The study aimed to assess dietary intake of antioxidant micronutrients and recovery outcomes of burn patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Questionnaires were administered to 40 burn patients at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (Ghana) from January 1, 2014 to May 30, 2014. The data taken include anthropometric measurements and dietary assessment. Their nutrient intakes were assessed with the Nutrient Analysis Template. The average intakes were compared to the recommended daily allowance. Assessment of recovery was based on records of wound healing assessments and infection rates from the health practitioners.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A cross-sectional study of 40 patients revealed an average total burn surface area (TBSA) of 31.4&#x000a0;%, where 70.0, 35.0, 75.0, 52.5, 12.5 and 32.5&#x000a0;% patients were deficient in vitamins A, C and E, zinc, copper and selenium, respectively and adequate amounts of vitamin C intake were related with significantly better wound healing progress. Positive wound healing outcomes were observed for patients with adequate vitamins A and E and zinc intake. Less infection presented among patients with adequate amount of vitamins A and C and zinc, but this was not observed for patients with adequate vitamin E, copper and selenium.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Most burn patients did not meet their dietary requirements for antioxidant micronutrients and this was due to meals not tailored to suit individual requirements. Adequacy of the antioxidants especially vitamin C resulted in positive wound healing outcomes. Hence, there is need for planned well-balanced meals of high vitamin C.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Dietary intake</kwd><kwd>Antioxidants</kwd><kwd>Micronutrients</kwd><kwd>Recovery</kwd><kwd>Wound infection</kwd><kwd>Wound healing</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Burns place a great socio-economic burden on individuals, their families and the health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Apart from the financial burden to families, communities, and the nation, it leads to pain, infection, extensive scarring, wound and scar contractures, amputations and death in some of its victims [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 43,000 people die of burns in Africa every year with a rate of 6.1 per 100,000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In Ghana, the incidence is 6.1 per 100,000 persons, an extrapolated incidence of 1.3&#x000a0;% with more women and children being victims because of the roles of a typical Ghanaian woman. Burn injury accounts for 265,000 deaths annually and children below 20 are the most affected. It is important to note that majority of deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>The main causes of mortality in burn patients are associated with infection, delayed wound healing, and extensive protein catabolism. Underlying these processes include immunological, endocrine, inflammatory and other metabolic responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. When the skin is exposed in burn patients, there are several mechanisms that lead to oxidative damage to the cell membranes. This includes the peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acid residues in membranes that can lead to membrane impairment, in addition to fragmentation of proteins at vulnerable points in the amino acid chain. There is also the irreversible damage to protein sites where metal ions normally bind to functional protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Apart from this destruction to the cell membrane, there are several metabolic responses that render the individual susceptible to malnutrition. Among them is hypercatabolism, which contributes to the breakdown of muscle and fat. Hypermetabolic response in the individual leads to an increase in the basal metabolic rate to about 180&#x000a0;% and an increase in the utilization of nutrients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and can last at least 9 to 12&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The increase in the production of catecholamines contributes to an increase in the resting energy expenditure. Similarly, the release of glucocorticoids leads to an alteration in protein and carbohydrate metabolism. These result in an increase glucagon/insulin ratio leading to hyperglycemia. This is a result of increased gluconeogenesis, proteolysis, glycogenolysis and lipolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. There is also nutrient loss in urine and wound exudates and this can lead to hypoalbumenuria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Being a central part of post burn management, medical nutrition therapy ensures adequate nutrients for the victim to improve wound healing, to restore cutaneous losses and to manage infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Apart from the role of macronutrients in these, the role of micronutrients cannot be ignored especially antioxidant micronutrients.</p><p>Copper, zinc, selenium, and vitamins A, C and E are antioxidant micronutrients that are beneficial to burn patients when intakes are adequate. This is due to their roles in scavenging free radicals in the wound healing process&#x02014;homeostasis, inflammatory phase, proliferative phase and remodeling&#x02014;as well as their role in fighting infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study therefore was to assess the effect of dietary intake of antioxidant micronutrients on the various recovery outcomes of burn patients. The micronutrients considered were copper, zinc, selenium and vitamins A, C and E. The recovery outcomes are the progress of wound healing, presence of infection and the length of stay in the hospital.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study setting</title><p>The Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital is the second largest hospital in Ghana. It is the main referral hospital for the northern sector of Ghana. With a bed capacity of over a thousand, there are numerous units in the hospital that provide health care for persons who come to the facility. Among the units are the Reconstructive Plastic Surgery and Burns Unit under the Directorate of Surgery. In this Unit is a Burns Intensive Care Unit (BICU) that caters to burn patients who are critically ill. There are other wards that cater to less severe cases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Subjects</title><p>The chosen subjects were burn patients who were admitted to the BICU from January to May 2014 of all ages who consented to the study. Some other cases of interest were also taken from the outpatient department.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Data collection</title><p>Pretested questionnaires were administered to clinically consenting patients. Demographics, medical history, anthropometry, food frequency, and triplicate dietary recalls were done. Anthropometric measurements include weight, height, and mid-upper arm circumference for children. Multiple dietary recalls were done for all patients for 3&#x000a0;days including a day in a weekend. On admission, patients were fed with meals provided by the hospital.</p><p>Using handy measures, the weights of all the foods consumed by the subjects were recorded. The nutrient compositions in the foods were analyzed using the Nutrient Analysis Template (University of Ghana, Food Science and Nutrition Department). The average of the intakes was recorded and compared to the recommended daily intakes (University of Ghana, Food Science and Nutrition Department) of the individuals. Assessment of recovery was based on records of wound healing assessments, infection rates and the length of stay in the hospital from the health practitioners and a tape measure was also used to measure the diameter of the wounds.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data storage was done using Microsoft Excel 5.0 and graphs were drawn using Microsoft Excel.

Though children in this category did not record the highest figure; they recorded a considerably high percentage (42.5&#x000a0;%) of the total number of patients, giving the impression that the child within this category needs to be protected from burn injury. Also, children below age 2&#x000a0;years recorded 20.0&#x000a0;% for the burn injury which is quite high for such an age group. This could be as a result of negligence of mothers as well as the exposure of children to open flames in a typical setting of a home in a developing country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Also, the socio-economic background has an effect on burn injury. Only 5.0&#x000a0;% of the participants of this study belonged to a high socio-economic class corresponding to works done by Bell et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] which states that burn injury increases substantially with a lower socio-economic status.</p><p>The major cause of burn in this study was thermal (92.5&#x000a0;%) comprising of open flames, scalds, and gas explosion with chemical (2.5&#x000a0;%) and electrical (5.0&#x000a0;%) causes. This corresponds to the works done by Agbenorku et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The results from this study also show that majority (50.0&#x000a0;%) of the patients suffered burns with a TBSA above 25.0&#x000a0;% which is quite alarming because most fatalities occur in such severities. In addition, 70.0&#x000a0;% of the participants had burn injury of second degree, third degree, and mixed thickness, giving an indication that most of the injuries were very severe. In their study, Gokdemir et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] reported that mortality increases with increasing TBSA and burn depth. Also, the presence of ascobate in leukocytes and its rapid expenditure during infection and phagocytosis suggest that vitamin C has a role in immunity, hence the results obtained.</p><p>Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) influences all phases of wound healing such as the inflammatory phase, proliferative phase, and maturation, synthesis, and degradation of collagen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Collagen synthesis, maturation and stabilization are also roles of vitamin C. It is also responsible for neutrophil migration to the site of injury and has a role in clotting when the skin is exposed. From this study, it was noted that during the first 2&#x000a0;weeks of monitoring the patients, patients with adequate dietary intake of vitamin C recorded a remarkable increase in wound healing. This corresponds to the work done by Barbosa et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and Sahib et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] where supplementation of vitamin C reduced wound healing time. The results also revealed a significant change with a <italic>p</italic> value of 0.015 in the first week indicating that there was a significant improvement in wound healing outcomes in the first week.</p><p>Vitamin A is known to play diverse roles in the wound healing cascade. It enhances early inflammatory phase and promotes epithelial cell differentiation, collagen deposition, and immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]; hence, patients with adequate dietary intake had progress in wound healing during the first 2&#x000a0;weeks. Also, intake of vitamin A results in an increase in lymphocyte proliferation, and this has the ability to prevent wound infection due to the reduction of microbes on wounds. Vitamin A is also known to aid in the repair of damaged tissue and hence may be beneficial in counteracting free radical damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], increasing the wound healing rate.</p><p>When a wound is exposed, the presence of microorganisms greater than 100,000 results in no epithelialization. Vitamin E is responsible for the preservation of macrophages which act by eliminating the microorganism by phagocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Due to its role in immunity, it is not surprising that patients with adequate amount in their diet had a good wound healing outcome as compared to patients with inadequate amounts in their diet. This is similar to works done by Barbosa et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and Sahib et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>The effect of adequate intake of trace element supplementation on the recovery of burn patients is noted in most studies. This is evidenced by reduced length of stay in hospitals, increase in protein turnover, as well as a reduction in infection. The body&#x02019;s antioxidant defense network is premiered by glutathione peroxidase, and selenium is known to be a major component of glutathione transferase enzyme, an important enzyme for this antioxidant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Though the roles of these are not fully known, their role on various recovery outcomes is prominent. Copper and zinc are also co-factors of superoxide dismutase enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The results obtained from this study revealed that patients who had adequate zinc, copper, and selenium in their diet had positive wound healing outcomes and patients with adequate zinc had fewer reports of infections. This corresponds with works by Berger et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Most burn patients did not meet their dietary requirements for antioxidant micronutrient and this was due to meals not tailored to suit individual requirements, hence the need for planned and well-balanced meals. Routine supplementation of antioxidant micronutrients can also be considered. Policies to provide meals to burn patients on the ward are worth noting: vitamin C is the only micronutrient that showed a promising significant value (0.015) with respect to wound healing outcomes; hence, it is recommended that food with high vitamin C such as fruits and vegetables should be distributed to burn patients on admission.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>MA conceived and designed the study, acquired data, and wrote and critically edited the manuscript.

Fluids were administered in a protocolised manner to achieve euvolaemia based on echocardiography-derived left ventrical volumetric measures. Removed blood was sampled for plasma ions, acid-base status, haemoglobin, and glucose. This cycle was repeated at 15-min intervals until death.

Cannulation of the left common carotid artery was performed for blood pressure monitoring, blood sampling, and removal, and of the right internal jugular vein to enable fluid administration for haemodilution.

Aortic blood flow velocities were determined in the aortic arch using pulsed-wave Doppler. Stroke volume was determined as the product of velocity&#x02013;time integral and vessel cross-sectional area. Heart rate was determined by measuring the time between cardiac cycles.

The challenge in developing a more appropriately balanced crystalloid solution revolves around difficulty in providing a suitable anion to balance the cation content, as a significant amount of the plasma anionic buffer is normally provided by albumin. Using an animal model of progressive haemodilution, we performed a comprehensive assessment of the physiological and biochemical effects of resuscitation with fluids containing the most widely used anions: chloride, lactate, and acetate combined with similar concentrations of sodium. Despite distinct biochemical effects produced by the three separate crystalloids, there were no differences in haemodynamics, tissue oxygenation, total volume of fluid required, or time-to-death.</p><p id="p0120">Significant separation of plasma chloride was observed early in the chloride group, as expected. Although this did not cause a decrease in arterial pH, a significant difference in SID was seen. Acetate maintained bicarbonate concentrations albeit with a significant metabolic alkalosis compared with the other two groups. Acetate is metabolised by several organs, but mainly by muscle where it is converted to the central intermediary metabolite, acetyl coenzyme A. In contrast, lactate is mainly converted to either glucose or bicarbonate in the liver; in conditions of disrupted hepatic perfusion, its metabolism may be disturbed. This may account for both the greater decrease in bicarbonate seen with lactate compared with acetate, and the lack of a pH alkalisation effect seen with infusion of lactate. The reduced bicarbonate concentration explains the raised anion gap seen in the lactate group, while the anion gap is maintained in the chloride group because of the induced hyperchloraemia. There was no inter-group difference in serum glucose, thus the effect of organic anions (acetate and lactate) on glucose metabolism described elsewhere<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> was not seen.</p><p id="p0125">The differences in acid-base status did not impact on either survival or the total volume of resuscitation fluid infused.

Whether one is a proponent of the classical Henderson&#x02013;Hasselbalch equation or the Stewart hypothesis, the use of acid-base balance as a specific surrogate of hypovolaemia is flawed and may lead to adverse effects. All crystalloids lack oxygen-carrying capacity,<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> and may have potential pro-inflammatory and oxidative effects.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> Ideally, as used in this study, minimally-invasive, real-time dynamic haemodynamic monitoring (e.g. using change in stroke volume or end-diastolic ventricular diameter) should assess the impact of manoeuvres that alter venous return. This permits accurate titration of fluid that should minimise problems related to fluid under- or overload.</p><sec id="sec3.1"><title>Limitations</title><p id="p0140">We used a short-term model of progressive haemodilution to assess the impact of the different crystalloid fluids, with no attempt to return shed blood. In clinical practice, ongoing severe haemorrhage would prompt transfusion of blood. Whether this would result in any difference remains to be seen. However, our objective was to determine the acid-base effects of the three crystalloids in the absence of any confounding variables induced by blood transfusion. The animals were anaesthetised with isoflurane, which carries potential vasodilatatory and negative inotropic consequences that may impact upon tissue perfusion. However, experience over many years with this and similar models has revealed isoflurane to offer the greatest degree of cardiorespiratory stability in comparison with i.v. agents. Urinalysis was not performed as the animals became oliguric and then anuric early in the haemodilution protocol. In view of the short-term nature of the study, urea or creatinine was not measured. While differences likely exist between rat and man in terms of physiology, blood buffering capacity, and blood composition, comparison data in the stress environment are sparse. Similarly, differences in handling of the different anions also needs to be elucidated. Of note, acid-base homeostasis is remarkably similar across all non-hibernating mammalian species. Rats adequately reflect the human response to exercise,<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> and we consider the response to haemorrhage would likely be similar. Finally, it would be of interest to repeat the study with the animals under heavy sedation with/without paralysis and controlled mechanical ventilation to maintain fixed PaCO<sub>2</sub> values, acknowledging the impact of positive airways pressures and decreased sympathetic activation on the stress response.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0145">We compared resuscitative effects of chloride-, acetate- and lactate-containing crystalloid solutions in a rodent model of sequential haemodilution. The CS was associated with hyperchloraemia and the largest decreases in bicarbonate and SID, while the AS maintained serum bicarbonate but induced a significant metabolic alkalosis. However, all solutions had equivalent effects on haemodynamics and tissue oxygenation, volumes required to maintain diastolic filling at baseline levels, and time-to-death. Our results from the current study suggest that the metabolisable anions, acetate, and lactate, did not have an impact on either survival or total volume administered when compared with chloride. Regardless of composition, the main challenge in fluid therapy is the identification of the optimal volume that needs to be infused to correct tissue hypoperfusion adequately, but avoid overload. This should be the main goal when considering safe administration of resuscitation fluid.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Authors' contributions</title><p id="p0150">Designed the study: A.D., M.F.M.J., M.M., M.S.</p><p id="p0155">Performed the experiments: N.J.E., P.H., A.D.</p><p id="p0160">Interpreted the data: N.J.E., M.F.M.J., M.S.</p><p id="p0165">Wrote the initial manuscript: N.J.E., M.S.</p><p id="p0170">Comment and contribution to the initial manuscript: A.D., P.H., M.F.M.J., M.M.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Declaration of interest</title><p id="p0175">M.M. is a member of the Editorial Board of the <italic>British Journal of Anaesthesia</italic> and a consultant for Edwards Lifesciences and Deltex.

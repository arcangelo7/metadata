remain the gold standard for revascularization<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. Data on long-term outcomes of arterial revascularization
in venous grafts continue to show better effects even in the most recent
literature<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.
Nevertheless, because it is not always possible to achieve complete
revascularization through only arterial grafts, the use of saphenous vein grafts
(SVGs) is still common worldwide.</p><p>It has been shown that venous grafting induces inflammation and endothelial cell
damage and dysfunction, which promote migration and proliferation of vascular smooth
cells<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>A significant limitation of SVGs is their patency<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. Therefore, the correct identification of the neointimal
formation in venous grafts may help in the decision-making regarding the
intensification of lipid-lowering therapy, the use of antiplatelet drugs or even
gene therapy in the future. The aim of these therapies is to slow or preferably
reverse the progression of plaque formation within grafted veins. During the first
year, there are about 15% of occlusions in implanted aortocoronary venous
bypasses<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. It is estimated that ten years after surgery, only
60% of implanted aortocoronary venous bypasses remain patent and only 50% of patent
bypasses are free of atheromatous formations<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. Despite the common
treatment of ischemic heart disease using aortocoronary venous bypasses, there are a
few publications available concerning the <italic>in vivo</italic> observation of
neointimal formation in SVGs in patients. The aim of the study was to analyze the
formation of neointima in venous grafts in the first 1.5 years after the surgical
procedure using intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS). In a study by Willard et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>, there was a good
correlation between the ultrasound imaging and histological analysis, which enabled
the normal intima, intimal hyperplasia, venous wall fibrosis and atheromatous plaque
to be distinguished. One study that used virtual histology showed that the severity
of SVG atherosclerosis was parallel with a proportional increase in fibrofatty
tissue<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Our study was a subanalysis of a study, already published, that concerned
externally stented saphenous vein grafts. In the following study, only subgroup
of non-stented grafts were analyzed. It was approved by the local Ethics
Committee of the Medical University of Silesia in Katowice. The Bioethics
Commission number for approval of our study was L.dz. NN-013-267/01. All
patients provided informed consent.</p><p>The inclusion criteria for our main study were prior to CABG and included: men
and women, age 40-65 years, with multivessel coronary disease, critical stenosis
in right coronary artery (RCA), stable angina, systolic blood pressure below 160
mmHg, blood glucose below 7.8 mmol/L. The exclusion criteria were: lack of
written consent, inability to perform complete arterial revascularisation,
varicose veins, poor saphenous vein quality, unstable angina, low ejection
fraction (LVEF &#x0003c;30%), concomitant valve disease, critical carotid artery
stenosis, Leriche syndrome, and any other condition that limited life expectancy
to less than 2 years.</p><p>Seventy-seven separate IVUS examinations of venous bypasses were analyzed in 36
patients. IVUS assessment started in the first patient in the first month
following CABG and ended in the last patient 16 months after surgery. Every
patient was assessed only once after bypass surgery.</p><p>The evaluation of the plaque, including IVUS follow-up studies, was divided into
four time periods: I &#x02013; 0-4 months (22 grafts), II &#x02013; 5-8 months (23 grafts), III
&#x02013; 9-12 months (19 grafts) and IV &#x02013; 13-16 months (13 grafts) after CABG. The
patient details are presented in <xref rid="t2" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.
Different times of admissions in the Department of Cardiac Surgery were a reason
for the different follow-up of our patients. The Department first cared for
patients who needed urgent care and therefore the study patients were sometimes
unintentionally delayed. This has been the reason why a different time
assessment finally took place. The final analysis should depend on these
deadlines.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Patient&#x02019;s clinical characteristics.</p></caption><table frame="box" rules="all"><colgroup span="1"><col width="50%" span="1"/><col width="50%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" style="border-left:hidden" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</th><th align="center" style="border-right:hidden" rowspan="1" colspan="1">55&#x000b1;8</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" style="border-left:hidden" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hypertension (&#x0003e;140/90

EEM area and the lumen area), the SVG wall area (defined as the difference
between the outer border of the entire venous graft area and the EEM area) and
the plaque area/EEM area index were automatically calculated to perform a

medicine. Advances in cardiac surgery and cardiology directly reflect the results of
treatments and the life span of patients. The development of treatment techniques,
as well as diagnostic methods specifically in cardiology, progressed simultaneously.
In the case of invasive cardiology, intravascular ultrasound imaging of vessels, as
well as other imaging modalities, is currently in a strong position and, in most
interventional cardiology centers, it is applied as common procedure in clinical
studies and everyday medical practice. The method discussed significantly dominates
other angiographic examinations, especially for the diagnosis of early stages of
atheromatous plaque development.</p><p>Two-dimensional image of venous bypasses in angiographic examination and only the
evaluation of vessel lumen substantially limits the application of this method to
assess the processes involved in venous bypasses, including evaluation of
atheromatous plaque formation<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The advantage of intravascular ultrasound examination is the possibility of
visualizing the entire cross-section of both aortic and venous vessels and measuring
their specific elements, <italic>i.e</italic>., size, wall thickness, plaque value,
etc<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. The
aforementioned parameters enable a very detailed analysis of plaque development and
the adaptive mechanisms involved in the vessel<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>. The
interpretation of intravascular ultrasound relies on simple visual inspection of
acoustic reflections to determine plaque composition<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In our study, the external elastic membrane (EEM) in the intravascular examinations
of coronary arteries was usually measured as the inner limit of the zone of
hypoechogenicity that represented the media<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>. In contrast to the
arteries, evaluation of EEM in the case of venous bypasses is much more difficult.
This is because remodelling processes, including proliferation of myofibroblasts and
formation of extracellular substances, affect the entire vessel cross-sectional
area. The replacement of the adventitia and media by connective tissue results in
difficulties in the evaluation of EEM, even in a microscopic examination<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Higucki compared IVUS examinations performed on 15 venous bypasses up to the first
month after the procedure and 14 bypasses imaged 6 to 12 months after the procedure.
His analysis showed that, between the analyzed periods, the vessel&#x02019;s walls thicken
significantly and its lumen was preserved, and this thickening was compensated for
the enlargement of the entire bypass. The lumen of a venous bypass had a decreasing
tendency between the two periods analysed, but this was not statistically
significant<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The accuracy of the typical atheromatous plaque that was evaluated in the IVUS
examinations was estimated for a period of about nine months after the
operation<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>. which was
much earlier than the previous angiographic examinations showed.</p><p>In Hozumie&#x02019;s comparative analysis of venous bypasses performed along with an IVUS
examination conducted in the 1<sup>st</sup> month after the procedure, as well as
bypasses that had been subjected to an IVUS examination within 6 to 15 months after
the surgical procedure, a substantial increase of intima value was found<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In his studies, Tashihiko performed intravascular ultrasonography examinations in
venous bypasses within a period of 8 to 23 years after CABG<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>. This study did not confirm the
suggestion that veins are susceptible to compensate for the enlargement in the site
of growing atheromatous plaque. It is highly probable that severe fibrosis occurs
within the adventitia and inhibits the ability for a vessel to adapt. Based on the
examination performed, we conclude that the lumen of venous bypasses decreases in
the first six months after the surgical procedure, after which it maintains a
similar value in further observation in a statistically significant manner.</p><p>Although the mean values of the cross-sectional area of the formatting atheromatous
plaque tended to increase, statistically significant differences were not found.</p><p>The mean values of EEM did not show an increasing trend over time. A statistically
significant decrease in the EEM mean cross-sectional value of a venous bypass was
only found between the first and second periods.</p><p>The results of our study indicate that there is an intense process of neointimal
formation within the first 18 months after the procedure, which at this time
includes most of the venous bypasses. A decrease in the lumen value in venous
bypasses is most probably part of processes such as the development of neointima,
without compensating for vessel thickening, which is probably related to the intense
fibrosis that occurs within adventitia during this period.</p><p>Thus, the formatting neointima provides the basis for venous bypass atherogenesis in
the future. Furthermore, the intense process of its formation may lead to venous
bypass occlusion. Taking into account the fact that the process of formation of the
atheromatous plaque of neointima in venous bypasses occurs early, it is very
important to counteract this process by taking actions to minimize any venous damage
during the surgical procedure and to exclude any risk factors<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>.</p><sec><title>Limitations of the Method</title><p>The relatively low number of patients is a limitation of our study. IVUS analysis
was performed in 25 mm sections of aortocoronary venous bypass. This section has
a very good image quality, as well as the visible formation of neointima.
However, the entire venous bypass was analyzed, which may limit the
comprehensiveness of the conclusions.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The IVUS showed <italic>in vivo</italic> plaque formation in about 40% of
aortocoronary venous grafts during the first year after CABG. Between 13 and 16
months, plaque was visible in all grafts.</p><p>Despite the rapid development of interventional cardiology, CABG still plays an
important role in everyday practice and remains a treatment option for significant
number of patients; therefore, studies concerning potential improvements of this
method, as well as the follow-up treatment, are still required.</p><table-wrap id="t4" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="50%" span="1"/><col width="50%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors&#x02019; roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PW</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Contributed equally to the study in acquisition,

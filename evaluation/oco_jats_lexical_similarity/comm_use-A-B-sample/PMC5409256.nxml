is cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass. Our technique and experience of
cervical cannulation in infants and small children for repair of congenital
cardiac defects is reported in this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>From January 2013 to June 2015, 37 children (22 males) with mean age of
17.97&#x000b1;8.63 months and weight of 8.06&#x000b1;1.59 kg were operated on
for congenital cardiac defects through right lateral thoracotomy. The most
common diagnosis was ventricular septal defect (18 patients). In all
patients, right common carotid artery, right internal jugular vein and
inferior vena cava were cannulated for institution of cardiopulmonary bypass
and aorta was cross clamped through right 2<sup>nd</sup> intercostal
space.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were no deaths or any major complications related to cervical
cannulation. Common carotid artery cannulation provided adequate arterial
inflow while internal jugular vein with inferior vena cava provided adequate
venous return in all patients. No patient required conversion to sternotomy
or developed vascular, neurological or wound related complications. Three
patients had residual lesions (small leak across ventricular septal defect
patch-2, Grade II left atrio-ventricular valve regurgitation-1) and one
patient had mild left ventricular dysfunction. At discharge, both common
carotid artery and internal jugular vein were patent on color Doppler
ultrasonography in all patients. In a mean follow-up period of
11.4&#x000b1;2.85 months, all patients were doing well. No patient had any
wound related, neurological or vascular complication. No patient had
residual leak across ventricular septal defect patch.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Cervical cannulation of common carotid artery and internal jugular vein is a
safe, reliable, efficient and quick method for institution of
cardiopulmonary bypass in minimally invasive pediatric cardiac surgery.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Carotid Artery</kwd><kwd>Common. Jugular Veins. Cardiopulmonary Bypass.

invasive cardiac surgery in adults<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. In pediatric patients, restricted exposure and complications
associated with peripheral vascular cannulation has limited the use of minimally
invasive techniques predominantly in larger children and for simple congenital
cardiac defects. Whenever performed in infants and smaller children, total central
cannulation is the preferred technique<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. However, this
makes the operative field cluttered and reduces the space for instrument
maneuverability.</p><p>Over the years, innominate artery and common carotid artery (CCA) cannulation for
arterial inflow has been proved as safe technique for commencement of
cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in pediatric and adult patients, respectively for
complex aortic surgeries without complications<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. Similarly, direct
cannulation of CCA and internal jugular vein (IJV) has been safely used for
institution of extracorporeal membrane oxygenator (ECMO) in neonates and infants
with minimal risk of long-term vascular complications and stroke. Studies have
failed to find any definitive association between CCA ligation and risk of
stroke<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>CCA cannulation was performed at our institute in 5 pediatric patients operated for
re-do cardiac surgery (unpublished data). CCA cannulation was performed either
because patients sustained cardiac injury (three patients) or heart was adherent to
sternum on preoperative computed tomography of chest (two patients). In all five
patients, femoral and iliac vessels were found unsuitable for cannulation either
because of adhesions from previous cannulation or small size of vessels. All five
patients had an uneventful recovery without neurological or vascular complication
and both CCA and IJV were patent on postoperative Doppler ultrasonography. Using the
similar technique of cervical cannulation, infants and small children were operated
on with congenital cardiac lesions through a limited right lateral thoracotomy. CPB
was instituted by cannulation of CCA, IJV and inferior vena cava (IVC). The aim of
this study was to evaluate our technique's clinical usefulness and efficiency in
terms of postoperative complications especially neurologic outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>From January 2013 to June 2015, 37 pediatric patients (22 males) with mean age of

above the clavicle over the lower part of sternocleidomastoid muscle where two
heads of the muscle divide. Subcutaneous tissue and platysma divided and
sternocleidomastoid muscle exposed. Mastoid retractor applied and dissection
performed between two heads of the muscle. Both, CCA and IJV were isolated in
carotid sheath, looped and mobilized along length. Care was taken while
mobilizing IJV to avoid induction of spasm, which would make subsequent
introduction of venous cannula difficult. Whenever found, a small branch on the
medial aspect of IJV was ligated and divided. Rest of the mobilization of both
the vessels was safe as they don't have any other branch in the neck. Both the
vessels were looped and the patient was heparinized with 400 U/kg. Three minutes
later, 5 mm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft was anastomosed to CCA artery
after clamping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>) and synthetic
cyanoacrylate glue (OMNEX Surgical Sealant, Ethicon Inc, Johnson and Johnson,
Somerville, NJ, USA) was applied on the anastomosis to prevent oozing of the
blood the needle holes. Aortic cannula was inserted into the graft and tied with
silk thread. CCA clamps were removed, arterial cannula de-aired and connected to
arterial line. IJV was clamped cranially and opened transversely. Straight
venous cannula was inserted and advanced into RA, snugged and connected to
venous line. IJV was kept snared cranially during the procedure. Both, arterial
and venous cannulas were selected as per body surface area (BSA). In patients
with BSA &#x02264;0.5 m<sup>2</sup>, 12Fr DLP femoral arterial cannulae and 12Fr
Biomedicus One Piece Femoral Venous Arterial Cannulae (Medtronic Inc.
Minneapolis, MN, USA) were used for CCA and IJV cannulation respectively; while
in patients with BSA 0.5-0.69 m<sup>2</sup>, similar cannula of 14Fr size were
used. For IVC cannulation, DLP single stage venous cannulae with right angle
metal tip (Medtronic Inc. Minneapolis, MN, USA) used was one size larger than
IJV cannula.</p><p><fig id="f2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2 </label><caption><p>Operative photograph showing sequence of cervical cannulation. (A)

attention was turned to thoracotomy. Mechanical ventilation was disconnected and
pericardiotomy was performed parallel and 2-3 cm anterior to phrenic nerve to
expose the ascending aorta cranially and IVC caudally and pericardial stays were
inserted. Carbon dioxide was continuously insufflated into the operative field
throughout the procedure to displace intra-cardiac air. IVC was dissected,
looped and cannulated with angled venous cannula that was advanced into the
pericardial cavity through a stab incision in subxiphoid area. IVC was snugged
and snugger was left in the pleural cavity to keep it out of the operative
field. Mild hypothermia (30-32&#x000b0;C) was established. Assisted venous drainage was
used, if required, with a median vacuum pressure of 30 mmHg (range, 20-40 mmHg).
RA appendage was retracted towards IVC and dissection was performed with
scissors between aorta and right pulmonary artery to mobilize the aorta. De
Bakey atraumatic coarctation clamp was passed through a stab incision in right
second intercostal space in mid-axillary line and aorta was cross clamped at the
level of right pulmonary artery. Del Nido cardioplegia was delivered into the
aortic root using 16G needle puncture. When cardioplegia delivery was finished,
cardioplegia puncture site was enlarged with sharp scissors and a 5-0 plegted
polypropylene (prolene) suture was placed around the puncture site and left
loose. IJV cannula was pulled back into superior vena cava (SVC). SVC was
snugged and snugger was left into the pleural cavity as for IVC snugger. RA was
opened and a vent was inserted into the left atrium through patent foramen ovale
or atrial septal defect (ASD). When defect was absent, it was created and vent
was inserted.</p></sec><sec><title>Surgical Repair</title><p>Repair was performed depending upon the cardiac lesion similar to midline
sternotomy approach except in patients with ventricular septal defect (VSD). For
repair of VSD, anterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve was detached from annulus
to expose the borders of VSD.</p><p>In our series, three patients with ostium secundum atrial septal defect (OS-ASD)
had associated left superior vena cava (LSVC). In one patient, we were able to
loop and snug the LSVC by retracting the aorta and pulmonary artery; it was
snugged to prevent the flooding of operative field. In other two patients,
straight venous cannula was inserted in the LSVC through coronary sinus and
connected to cardiotomy sucker for drainage.</p><p>When intra-cardiac repair was finished, RA was repaired and SVC and IVC snuggers
were removed. After RA closure, carbon dioxide insufflation was stopped.
Ventricular pacing wire was placed. De-airing was performed by gently
compressing the heart against the spine with rear end of De Bakey forceps and
the lungs were ventilated manually. Aortic root was vented by allowing bleeding
from the cardioplegia puncture site into the pericardial cavity. Under low
flows, aortic cross clamp was removed and IJV cannula was advanced into RA. Time
was allowed for the heart to recover the sinus rhythm with good contractility of
the ventricles. After re-warming of the patient, IVC cannula was removed and IVC
repaired. After confirming the adequate de-airing on TEE, cardioplegia puncture
site was repaired. Finally, CPB was terminated in usual fashion.</p><p>When the procedure was finished, IJV cannula was removed and IJV was repaired
with interrupted 6-0 prolene sutures. Heparin was reversed with protamine
sulfate using dose of 1.0 mg/100 U of heparin. The PTFE graft was severed near
the anastomosis with CCA and was oversewn to prevent any residual stump. CCA
pulsation was confirmed. After hemostasis, both heads of sternocleidomastoid
muscle were approximated. Platysma and subcutaneous tissues were sutured. A
pericardial drain inserted through subxiphoid incision and another right pleural
drain through axillary incision. Pericardium was loosely approximated. Ribs were
loosely approximated with absorbable suture. Subcutaneous tissue and skin were
repaired with absorbable sutures.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Results are expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD). All data analysis
was performed using SPSS for windows, version 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Thoracotomy was performed in the third intercostal space in 31 patients and in the
fourth intercostal space in 6 patients. The lenght of axillary skin incision varied
between 3 and 6 cm and of cervical incision between 1.5 and 2 cm. Two patients
required enlargement of thoracotomy incision to improve the exposure of VSD.</p><p>Intraoperative and postoperative data is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>. CCA cannulation provided adequate arterial flow in all
patients. Similarly, IJV and IVC cannulation provided adequate venous return except
in five patients who required assisted venous drainage. No patient required a switch
to sternotomy for arterial or venous return. Furthermore, no intraoperative
complications related to the cannulation site, exposure or bleeding was noted. All
the patients, except three, regained spontaneous sinus rhythm following removal of
aortic cross clamp. Three patients regained ventricular fibrillatory rhythm
initially; two spontaneously reverted to sinus rhythm once the heart was completely
emptied while one patient required cardioversion.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Intraoperative and postoperative data including echocardiography and

antegrade cerebral perfusion during deep hypothermia in adult patients operated on
for complex aortic and re-do cardiac surgeries. This technique has proved its
efficacy and neurological safety<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. In neonates, selective unilateral
CCA cannulation is performed by advancing the arterial cannula from ascending aorta
or innominate artery to CCA and used for ascending aorta and arch repair during deep
hypothermia for antegrade cerebral perfusion<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. Studies have found the technique to be safe without
increased risk of neurological complications. As per literatute, direct cannulation
of CCA, however, has not been used in pediatric cardiac surgery.</p><p>CCA is easily accessible at the base of neck and like innominate artery or aorta, it
is sturdy and not easily damaged<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. In our previous experience of 5 patients, CCA was found to be of
sufficient size even in small children to supply the total cardiac output. The flow
in CCA is distributed to whole body without causing ipsilateral brain
hyperperfusion. This is confirmed by the results of our study. We observed adequate
radial artery pressures during CPB and absence of any neurological, myocardial or
abdominal organ dysfunction in postoperative period in all patients. The possible
explanation may lie in an experimental study by Z&#x000e9;icourt et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. Authors using a realistic
hypoplastic neonatal aorta template as the base geometry for effect of cannulation
technique on flow distribution, found that flow distribution to the different
vascular beds in neonates was dictated by the downstream vascular resistances rather
than the cannulation strategy. The similar mechanism may be responsible for flow
distribution in infants, children and adults as other studies in adults have also
failed to find any sign of hyperperfusion with this technique<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Similarly, IJV is sufficiently large and easily accessible for venous return during
CPB. Due to same reasons, cervical cannulation of CCA and IJV are preferred route
for establishment of pediatric ECMO. However, in contrast to ECMO, our technique
does not require ligation of either CCA or IJV; thus prevents the risk of stroke and
cerebral and facial edema<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>An important concern during CCA cannulation is the risk of neurological injury.
Therefore, NIRS was used to detect any decrease in cerebral oxygen saturation from
the time of anastomosing the graft to CCA and during CPB. In our study, no patient
had &#x0003e;15% fall in NIRS from baseline during CPB. This was probably because the
cerebral flow was maintained through both the carotid arteries even during aortic
cross clamping as blood supply to whole brain including posterior circulation is
maintained by rich network of anastomoses interconnecting the cervical, vertebral,
occipital, and carotid arteries designated as 'suboccipital carrefour or
knot'<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>. Absence of
postoperative neurological complications in any patient confirms our assumption.</p><p>Cervical cannulation for institution of CPB has several advantages over central
cannulation. First, it completely avoids the need to gain control of the aorta for
arterial cannulation, an important limitation of lateral thoracotomy<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. As aorta is away from
thoracotomy incision, there is poor control of depth of arterial cannula insertion.
This increases the risk of vascular accidents as well as neurological complications.
Second, cervical cannulation along with aortic cross clamp insertion through a
separate stab incision moves the entire hardware away from the operative field. This
improves the working space and freedom of instrument maneuverability. Other authors
have also emphasized the importance of peripheral cannulation to prevent cluttering
in the operative field. However, femoral cannulation is better suited for older
children, while cervical cannulation can be performed even in neonates and
infants<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Third, straight multi-hole cannula inserted into IJV is easily advanced into RA and
leads to almost complete emptying of the heart. Therefore, mechanical ventilation
can be discontinued as soon as CPB is commenced. This improves the exposure of
pericardium and heart and ease the insertion and removal of IVC cannula. The IVC
cannula can be removed early after removal of aortic cross clamp without
compromising the venous drainage. Fourth, this technique of CPB avoids additional
groin incisions and potential peripheral vascular complications. Fifth, cannulation
of graft rather than direct cannulation of CCA almost nullifies the risk of intimal
injury and narrowing of CCA. De-airing can be adequately performed by enlarging the
cardioplegia puncture site and TEE guidance. All of our patients readily regained
consciousness without neurological complications. This further confirms the adequacy
of de-airing of the heart.</p><p>An important concern with CCA cannulation is the potential risk of cerebral
hyperperfusion during CPB. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) rather than NIRS is better
modality to detect the hyperperfusion<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. However, we did not perform the TCD in our study due to
non-availability. Our strategy to prevent hyperperfusion was to reduce the arterial
pressure during CPB while monitoring the NIRS because cerebral blood flow is
predominantly determined by arterial pressure rather than the CPB flow. In our
study, no patient developed symptoms of cerebral hyperperfusion, although, we did
not specifically investigated this. However, even if brain hyperperfusion is
detected on TCD, it can easily be corrected by looping the CCA cranial to graft
anastomoses and applying the clip to partially snug the artery to adjust the TCD
velocity.</p><p>We choose lateral thoracotomy as it is cosmetically and functionally
superior<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>. However,
there are certain shortcoming of this approach <italic>e.g.</italic> difficulty in
cannulation of aorta, IVC and limited exposure of the right ventricle free wall and
left sided structures of the heart as the heart falls farther away to the left as it
gets empty. Cervical cannulation and single dose del-Nido cardioplegia<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> overcome the difficulties
associated with cannulation. We, however, believe this incision is suitable only for
repair of simple congenital cardiac defects that can be accomplished through RA. In
our experience, apical, mid-muscular, doubly committed and outlet VSDs are the
contraindications for this approach. We also consider the presence of LSVC as a
relative contraindication as it makes the operative procedure cumbersome and the
operative field cluttered. We have not operated any patients of tetralogy of Fallot
through this approach, however, we consider it a challenge.</p><p>Cervical cannulation for CPB can be used with any minimally invasive approach and
even in pediatric patients operated for re-do or aortic arch surgeries as in our
initial experience. In our experience, this technique adds 15-20 minutes to
operative time, however, lots of struggle associated with central cannulation and
exposure can be avoided. Further studies with technique may pave the path for this
approach as an alternative safe technique for establishment of CPB in pediatric
patients.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Limitations of our study include its retrospective nature and small sample size.
However, it does contribute to establish cervical cannulation as an alternative
technique for CPB in minimally invasive and complex aortic pediatric cardiac
surgeries.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Cervical cannulation using side-graft on CCA for arterial inflow and IJV cannulation
for venous return is a reliable and safe method for installation of CPB in minimally
invasive pediatric cardiac surgery. This technique is safe, efficient, and quick in
its execution and compared to minimally invasive technique, this technique avoids
the handling of the aorta and the SVC. Complications directly associated with
cervical cannulation are uncommon.</p><table-wrap id="t4" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="10%" span="1"/><col width="90%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PG</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Conception and study design; analysis and/or data

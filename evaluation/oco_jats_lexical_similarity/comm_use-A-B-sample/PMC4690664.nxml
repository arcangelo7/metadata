surgical technique called partial left ventriculectomy, where he admitted the
possibility of reducing the diameter of the left ventricle through the sectioning
of one section of its wall. After the publication of this study, thousands of case
reports and procedure analysis have been published, and due to several
disappointing results, many doctors and institutions failed to execute it. As the
main objective of this study, stands out the search for success cases of
ventriculectomy in the last 12 years and if during this period it was achieved
some significant development in this procedure that allows obtaining lower
mortality rate postoperatively.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS</title><p> Systematic review of indexed scientific literature over the past 12 years and the

study and understand the structure and functioning of the heart, the greater the chances
of obtaining and analyzing new techniques for treatment and prevention of heart
disease.</p><p>Among these diseases, there is the Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM), which is a heart muscle
disease characterized mainly by left ventricular (LV) dilatation and systolic
dysfunction<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Thus, the ventricles are unable
to pump enough blood volume to meet the metabolic needs of the body, leading to heart
failure (HF).</p><p>Batista et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> present
the development of a technique called Partial Left Ventriculectomy (PLV), also known as
Batista's surgery, changing the way they considered cardiac interventions when admitted
the possibility of reducing the diameter of the left ventricle through the section of a
slice of its wall. The procedure is based on the knowledge that in DCM occurs the
increasing in LV diameter, but it does not occur sufficient increase in muscle mass, and
therefore, a possible damage repair would be the reduction in ventricle diameter to a
value close to what was prior to the injury. The operation is based physical and
mathematically by one of the forms of Laplace's Law (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1">EQ. 1</xref>).</p><boxed-text id="bx1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><mml:math id="e1"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">kT</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">/</mml:mo><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo fence="true" stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo fence="true" stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></boxed-text><p>Where <italic>P</italic> is the intracavity pressure, <italic>T</italic> is the tension

is a constant, consisting originally in the section of a muscle slice of the LV lateral
wall (generally ellipse shape), starting at the end of it, extending between the
papillary muscles and ending close to the mitral ring. The idea is that with the removal
of the cardiac muscle slice, a reduction in ventricular diameter can occur, causing the
heart to return to being an efficient pump with characteristics similar to that it had
before the worsening of the disease.</p><p>Once it is a very invasive procedure, the technique is designed to patients in advanced
stages of DCM. After Batista's study, thousands of case reports and analyzes of the
procedure were published, however, due to several disappointing results, many doctors
and institutions ceased to execute it. These bad results show mortality rates ranging
from 25% to 80% and a relation with many of these works can be obtained in Lunkenheimer
et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>As the main objective of this study stands out the search for success stories of
ventriculectomy in the last 12 years and if during this period it was achieved some
significant development in this procedure that allows obtaining lower mortality rate
postoperatively.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>This is a study of systematic review of literature, developed with indexed scientific
production and it has been performed through search in the periodical portal of
CAPES.</p><p>The search has been made in order to obtain articles with the descriptor "Partial Left
Ventriculectomy" anywhere in the text, which have been published in any language and in
the last 12 years. In addition, the option to display only peer-reviewed articles was
selected.</p><p>After gathering and obtaining all the studies presented in the survey, an analysis based
on abstracts was performed, as well as discussions and conclusions of all of them, in
order to consider only items that could help in achieving the real goals of this study.
In other words, papers involving reports of PLV success and those involving specific
studies or reports to identify ways to improve the effectiveness of this surgical
procedure.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><p>The performed search had collected 206 articles distributed in 22 professional
periodicals, allocated in databases: Scopus, MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, OneFile, Web of
Science, Scielo and PubMed databases. Moreover, some of them were duplicated, once they
appear in more than one database and many had no relation to the stated objectives for
this study. Thus, after analysis and rigorous selection, 43 articles were obtained with
the desired profiles. The nationalities of the institutions of the authors are reported

relating to success case studies and developments in the PLV, with 46.5% of the 43
analyzed studies, followed by Germany with 20.9%. From what it can be seen, the Japanese
dominance in these studies may have intimate relation with the legal difficulty, because
in Japan the organ donation is forbidden for children under 15 years<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. In addition, religious issues
also influence the decision making for transplants<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The individual participation of Brazil is small, but if added the number of studies
published with co-participation of researchers and/or national institutions, there is a
total of 8 articles, which represents 18.6% of the analyzed studies, indicating a good
Brazilian contribution in this area, including many works with the participation of Dr.
Randas himself.</p><sec><title>Case reports</title><p>Some success cases have been described over the past 12 years. One of them was the
case report of three Japanese children aged between 8 months and 3 years and a half,
all with DCM. They had undergone PLV and repair of the mitral valve (RMV) at the
Yamanashi Medical University hospital from May 1998 to April 2000<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. The procedure that was
performed in the first child was urgently done and after 3 months her condition got
worse and she had to be transferred to the US for transplantation, since in Japan
organ donation for children under the age of 15 years is not allowed.</p><p>The other two children responded well to the procedure and factors such as fractional
shortening (FS) and ejection fraction (EF) improved significantly, allowing great
improvement in life quality. During a couple of years of postoperative follow-up, all
patients presented good recovery.</p><p>The authors point out that the area to be sectioned in adults may vary according to
the most damaged myocardial region, found by preoperative evaluation. However, this
region is narrower in children, once the mitral valve replacement and the papillary
muscles translocation are not recommended, thus restricting the section of the heart
section to the inter-papillary region. Therefore, this observation may define the
best way to select a patient who is a PLV candidate, by choosing the most damaged
myocardium region. In addition, only the child who was urgently submitted to
procedure has not achieved good results after the surgery, indicating that important
factors to the surgery success may not have been analyzed, once the cardiovascular
surgery has as its foundation operate, whenever possible, on an elective basis, in
order to the larger set of data on the patient can be analyzed and the best decision
taken, thereby maximizing the probability of success in the proceedings.</p><p>Another interesting study that indicates positive results after completion of the
PLV, as the one presented by Sugiyama et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> is the study performed by Coelho de Souza et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>. In his
study, only one child diagnosed with idiopathic DCM has been undergoing the procedure
and monitored for 70 months. This child was the same age range reported
in<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> 2 years
and a half, and in functional class III/V as the cases analyzed by Batista et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>. After the procedure both EF and the patient's FS of
the LV improved significantly, reaching values of 63% and 28%, respectively, 24
months after the PLV. By the fifth year of follow-up these favorable results
regressed a little. However, during this entire period the patient was classified in
NYHA class I.</p><p>Souza et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>, in
line with Sugiyama et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> believe the procedure should be considered for treatment,
especially because it also works as a bridge to transplantation. It also improves
significantly the child's life quality over a long period, including greater
tolerance to physical activity. Still in agreement, both studies emphasize the
importance to develop means to define protocols for each patient, in order to reduce
the risks of intraoperative and postoperative complications.</p><p>Yamagishi et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>
and Westaby et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> present separately a female child case, one is 3 years
old and the other is only 5 months old, both with ischemic DCM caused by anomalous
origin of the left coronary artery of pulmonary artery, submitted to PLV. In both
cases, and in agreement with the results of Souza et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> study, after performing the
procedure, the kids have already presented very significant improvements in LV
function, sharp reduction in the cavity volume and great improvement in FS. However,
only Westaby et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> performed monitoring, and it is reported that in the last
assessment the child was already 10 years old, in NYHA class I, played sports and had
normal mental and physical development, showing great results at long term.</p><p>More encouraging results have been obtained by Horii et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> and Suma et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>, which unlike Sugiyama et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>, Souza et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> and
Yamagishi et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>,
analyzed the results of PLV completion in much larger samples, 70, 96, 107 and 36
patients, respectively, with global aged between 14 and 76 years, all in functional
class III or IV by NYHA, and 83% of these also underwent mitral valve reimplantation.
The determination of the region to be sectioned was made based on intraoperative
echocardiography, by choosing the area which wall was thinner and akinetic. The
results obtained by Horii et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> are very similar to those obtained by Suma et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>, and all corroborate with
Sugiyama et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>
when they conclude, as it was expected, that the best results were obtained for the
procedures performed on an elective basis, whose hospital mortality rates were
between 7% and 13.8%, against high rates to those performed on an emergency basis,
ranging from 57% to 60.9%. Moreover, the results obtained by Horri et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> for
survival rates during the first year, 75.5%, are relatively better than those
obtained by Suma et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>,
whose respective rates were 66.4, 66.9 and 67.5%. Besides that, in all studies, good
survival rates for subsequent years were presented and 50.2% obtained by Suma et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>, the
highest 7-year survival rate in these articles. In all these studies, the patients
remained in functional class I and II, with increased EF and LV dimensions reduced
throughout the follow-up period that lasted seven years in maximum<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>
</p><p>In Kawaguchi et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> study, 65 patients underwent LPV, and among them, 24 also
underwent RMV. As a result, 83% of the patients (54 patients) have been discharged
from hospital and had significant improvements in ventricular dimensions, contractile
function, EF and circumferential shortening. Only 37% of them (24 patients) have been
monitored during a period of 170&#x000b1;115 days. During this time, significant
improvements have remained in all patients.</p><p>Giuffrida et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>,
Soo et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> and
Shin et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>
reported very interesting cases of major successes in monitoring only one patient in
each one of the articles, after the completion of LPV. In the first study a
60-year-old man with DCM and HF of functional class III have been monitored during 40
months and showed considerable progress in EF, which passed from 15% to 30% and he
went up to class II, greatly improving his life quality. On the other hand, Soo et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> present
the 8-year monitoring of a 65 year-old man with class HF III, submitted to LPV and
RMV. There was an overall improvement in ventricular function which remained
throughout the follow-up period, leading the HF to be reclassified to Class I and
causing the patient to have an amazing ability to exercises.</p><p>In line with the results obtained by Soo et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>, Shin et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> present a unique monitoring
case of a patient undergoing PLV for 13 years (first PLV held in Korea) and
performing 3d echocardiography to evaluate the state of the cardiac muscle, its
dimensions, volume and EF. The results placed the HF patient in functional class II
and demonstrated that the procedure benefits have been the same during the
monitoring.</p><p>Besides the use of PLV to reduce the tension on the left ventricle wall in patients
with DCM, Bossert et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> have described another application of this procedure. In
this study, it is reported the use of this technique for the removal of a cardiac
fibroma in the free wall of the LV of a child of only eight months. During a 48-month
follow-up it has not been observed any recurrence of the tumor and the proper LV
functioning was confirmed.</p><p>Sch&#x000e4;fers et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> and Wilhelm et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> present the results of a 100% successful
experiment in performing the PLV with reimplantation of the mitral valve in a group
of 12 patients. After all the procedures, they already had significant signs of
increase in EF and decrease in LV dimensions. However, 2 patients died within a year
of completing the procedure. However, the other 10 patients maintained the good
results of the procedures after a year, and the survival rate during this period was
then 83.3%. The PLV indication for these patients was carefully made, where the
nominees were chosen based on NYHA functional class (&#x0003e;III), cardiac index (&#x0003c;2.5
liters/min/m<sup>2)</sup>, maximum consumption of O<sub>2</sub> (&#x0003c;14
ml/kg/min), LV final diastolic diameter (&#x0003e;7) and mitral insufficiency (&#x0003e;2).</p><p>The PLV has been also successfully tested in dogs, as it can be seen in the study by
Christiansen et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup>, Christiansen &#x00026; Gruber<sup>[<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> and Martins et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup>. The
first two studies reported an experiment where DCM was induced in a group of 6 dogs
with the use of adriamycin intracoronary following a protocol pre-defined by the
researchers. All the dogs were submitted to PLV. The mortality rate was 25% during a
13-week follow-up, where EF and ventricular dimensions had their values improved.</p><p>In these studies, until they reach the protocol that led them to a 25% mortality
rate, it was reported that in a previous group of dogs where DCM had been induced,
there was a 100% of mortality after the PLV. It occurred because the dogs had grand
marginal arteries, increasing the probability of myocardial infarction, due to the
need for ligation in case of PLV. Therefore, they got to a very important conclusion,
once it was observed that the arteries anatomy is an important factor for the PLV
success.</p><p>In Martins et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup>
a group of four dogs underwent PLV and the other, also composed by 4 dogs underwent
partial right ventriculectomy (PRV), all the animals were not carriers of DCM and
they were all examined and studied during the pre-, intra- and postoperatively
periods, during 1, 7, 14, 21, 30 and 60 days after surgery, with 100% survival in
this period. Due to the excellent obtained results, both studies indicate the
procedure as an evolution form to the DCM treatment searches.</p><p>In a study on the LPV results in elderly patients, Shimura et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> indicate that they can also
receive benefits with this procedure, because the analyzes present results similar to
those obtained for younger people, with 57% of hospital survival of the elderly (over
65 years) against 62% of the younger ones.</p><p>In 2005 a study about the morphological effect in 15 patients surviving to PLV was
performed a year after its completion, and it was verified that in addition to the
significant reduction in the functional classes these patients presented, there were
also favorable effects on myocardial structure, especially in the ventricular
diameter and in the tissue quality<sup>[<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>More recently, two studies were published and they reported success in the PLV
performing. At first, Yoda et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> describe the case of a patient with DCM that has been
subjected to various procedures, including PLV. The 29-year-old man, who was in
functional class IV (NYHA) presented significant improvements in the LV function
after the procedures had been performed and it took him not much time to go back to
normal life (Class I), and these circumstances were kept for throughout the period of
one year of monitoring. In the second report, Gonz&#x000e1;lez L&#x000f3;pez et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> present
a case similar to those described by Yamagishi et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> and Westaby et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>, where
a four-month baby with anomalous origin of the left coronary artery of the pulmonary
artery and who developed severe heart failure with EF&#x0003c;20%, was submitted to PLV.
After the procedure it was obtained EF=55% and reduced to NYHA class I, and these
values remained during the period of one year follow-up.</p><p>The vast majority of the successful study described herein have in common an
important stage which we believe is crucial to the success of the
LPV<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup>.
This stage consists in assessing the best area to be sectioned in the lateral wall of
the LV by intraoperative echocardiography (besides, of course, careful visual
assessment of myocardial conditions after the heart exposure). In this evaluation, as
well as performed in Horii et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> and Suma et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>, the area to be sectioned in the free wall of the LV,
generally was that thinner and akinetic one, since this region does not contribute to
the proper functioning of this cavity. Some of the studies did not perform this
stage, or at least did not report it<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup>.
In case some of them have not done this assessment, it may be that the sections have
been made in kinetic regions, still leaving akinetic regions in the LV wall. In other
words, the active parts may have been sectioned and the inactive parts of the
ventricles sidewalls may have been left apart. This stage, though the results have
been good in all of them, perhaps could assist in obtaining even better results. In
addition, it is also unanimous the need for careful selection of patients to be
submitted to PLV, which is also corroborated by other studies<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>-<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup>.
However, it is not observed a standard protocol selection for candidates to this
procedure, indicating that developments in this area and discussions on this protocol
must be made.</p></sec><sec><title>Case reports and possible procedure innovations</title><p>Several articles published by leading researchers worldwide have some good ways to
improve the PLV efficiency.</p><p>Koyama et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</sup>
present an innovative study, demonstrating that the LV apex plays a key role in
optimizing its functioning. This information was the basis for their experiment on
dogs, where two groups, each one composed by six dogs had induced DCM and underwent
PLV, and one of the groups had a section made until the apex, which was preserved in
the other group. The results of the group where the apex had been preserved were much
better. This result allowed new insight into the way of sectioning the heart section
in the LV wall, indicating that the apex preservation could improve the results of
the PLV. Subsequent studies stressed the importance of this result and confirm their
veracity<sup>[<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>-<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In addition, Matsui et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]</sup> also mention the importance of preserving the original
ventricular geometry so that its functions can be fully accomplished. Therefore, it
is necessary that the section made on its wall allows its permanency on elliptical
shape. The importance of preservation or restoration of the original LV geometry is
not highlighted only in studies related to PLV, as seen in the studies by Braile et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]</sup>, Jatene
et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]</sup>, Braile et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]</sup> and
Ferreira Filho<sup>[<xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Important notes on improvement possibilities in the PLV can be analyzed in
Lunkenheimer et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]</sup>, which among other successful researchers, there is also
Dr. Randas Batista as a member. In this study, the authors stress that until the
moment of its fulfilling, the size, shape and location of the section to be sectioned
was the surgeon's decision to make, and once the procedure had been performed, it was
impossible to avoid future problems, once removal would have been already made. It
also describes that when making an exaggerated section in the LV, the RV function may
also be impaired.</p><p>The authors also present an experiment report conducted in pigs with a realization
protocol of the PLV, in which they obtained good results. However, this study was
published almost simultaneously with the study by Koyama et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</sup> and maybe that is the reason
why it does not incorporate the need to preserve the apex.</p><p>The LV region location where the section should be done may be performed in most of
the cases by the volume reduction test based on echocardiography, as already observed
in the previous section, which is already a major breakthrough that allowed the best
results to the procedure. The format of the section to be sectioned is generally
elliptical, but in some cases it has already been performed hourglass shaped
sections<sup>[<xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>However, in spite of considering the original geometry of the LV is best preserved
when the section is elliptical, no works were found on studies reporting the
influence of the sections formats in the procedure's efficiency and that assist in
the maintenance of the LV geometry.</p><p>Other studies also report that one of the facts that contribute to the failure of the
PLV realization is the myocardial extended section, in other words, the withdrawal of
a larger section of what it should be<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>-<xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]</sup>.
Kawaguchi et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]</sup>
report that the ideal is that the section is the minimum size required, while in
Westaby<sup>[<xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]</sup> it
is emphasized that, until the completion of their work, there were no ways to
determine the optimal amount to be sectioned from the LV wall, allowing the removal
of exaggerated sections, impairing the ventricular function. On the other hand,
Kawaguchi et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>
reported that a very long incision may generate ventricular constriction, because the
ventricular cavity reduction will be bigger than necessary, making the heart
vulnerable to ventricular fibrillation or sudden death.</p><p>Aiming to obtain a method of determining the size of the section to be sectioned, and
therefore allowing that the problems related to myocardial extended section may be
avoided, a research group of the Post-Graduation in Mechanical
Engineering/Bioengineering at the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (Federal
University of Minas Gerais) has started a research on the possibilities of
determining these dimensions, and preliminary theoretical results have been published
in major conferences in this area<sup>[<xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>-<xref rid="r53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]</sup>.
It is believed that after the consolidation of the way to obtain these dimensions, it
should be a mandatory part of the realization protocol of PLV, where each patient
will quickly have the determination of how much must be sectioned so that the removed
section is actually the ideal size.</p><p>Three mathematical models related to PLV have been found. Ottesen &#x00026;
Danielsen<sup>[<xref rid="r54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]</sup>
present a model to make the analysis of the ventricular contraction, and it can be
used to measure the PLV efficiency, comparing prior and subsequent results to the
procedure. Dorri et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup> developed a model to investigate the ventricular
deformation and used it to prove that in properly selected cases this procedure may
be feasible, and that the PLV is according to physical-mathematical description
expressed in Batista et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>. The
third model is described by Warwick et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]</sup> and it is based on a mathematical technique
called "finite element", and it aims to provide changes in LV contractile function
ulterior the PLV, to assist in a more adequate selection of the patients for this
procedure. However, no reports of further improvements and practical applications of
these models were found, indicating that so far, it has been made very little
evolution of mathematical modeling application as an assistant in improving and
analysis of PLV.</p><p>Thus, after all the reports described in this study, it is possible to believe that
many of discouraging results on the PLV perhaps could have been avoided if the
selection criteria had been better studied, if the determination of the most affected
regions of the LV wall had been analyzed and if the results such as the need to
preserve the apex and the coronary arteries anatomy have been investigated
previously.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>During the last 12 years, important reports of success and innovation in the PLV
achievement have been published. Japan presents the largest number of achievements and
innovations in the procedure and Brazil has a considerable contribution as the country
of the lead authors of two studies and participation in more than 18% of the total
articles that have been found.</p><p>It was evident that the quality of the PLV results can be improved and it is needed a
rigorous selection criteria of the patients which best suit to procedure.</p><p>The necessity of the ventricular apex preservation when executing the section, in order
to ensure the quality of ventricular contractions after the PLV is a prominent factor in
this study, and it proved to be very important in a considerable number of the searched
studies. Thus, this consideration should always be taken into account while performing
the PLV. In addition, another important factor is the anatomy of the coronary arteries,
since it has been found that patients with large marginal arteries are at high risk of
heart attacks after the PLV.</p><p>Many studies show the necessity of making appropriate size sections to prevent excessive
reduction of the ventricular cavity. For that reason, a mathematical and computational
model, capable of performing sizing of the heart section to be sectioned, and thus may
prevent the occurrence of complications related to sections extended, is already being
studied and developed.</p><table-wrap id="t3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-top-style:solid"><th colspan="3" align="left" rowspan="1">

We have recently shown that deletion of the receptor Bmpr1a in the osteoblast lineage with <italic>Dmp1-Cre</italic> reduces osteoblast activity in general but stimulates proliferation of preosteoblasts specifically in the cancellous bone region, resulting in diminished periosteal bone growth juxtaposed with excessive cancellous bone formation. Because expression of sclerostin (SOST), a secreted Wnt antagonist, is notably reduced in the Bmpr1a-deficient osteocytes, we have genetically tested the hypothesis that increased Wnt signaling might mediate the increase in cancellous bone formation in response to Bmpr1a deletion. Forced expression of human SOST from a Dmp1 promoter fragment partially rescues preosteoblast hyperproliferation and cancellous bone overgrowth in the Bmpr1a mutant mice, demonstrating functional interaction between Bmp and Wnt signaling in the cancellous bone compartment. To test whether increased Wnt signaling can compensate for the defect in periosteal growth caused by Bmpr1a deletion, we have generated compound mutants harboring a hyperactive mutation (A214V) in the Wnt receptor Lrp5. However, the mutant Lrp5 does not restore periosteal bone growth in the Bmpr1a-deficient mice. Thus, Bmp signaling restricts cancellous bone accrual partly through induction of SOST that limits preosteoblast proliferation, but promotes periosteal bone growth apparently independently of Wnt activation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Originally discovered in bone, bone morphogenetic proteins (Bmp) play essential roles in both embryogenesis and postnatal tissue homeostasis in mammals.<sup>

The mouse strains were maintained in a mixed genetic background of mostly C57BL6 and some 129. All analyses were performed on sex-matched littermates including both males and females at the age of 33 days (P33). All mice were housed in a specific pathogen-free (SPF) barrier facility managed by Washington University Department of Comparative Medicine. The animals were group housed with a 12-h light cycle (6:00&#x02013;18:00) and fed standard chow (PicoLab mouse diet 20, product number 5058). The Animal Studies Committee at Washington University approved all mouse procedures used in this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Morphological analyses of bones</title><p>X-ray radiography was performed with Faxitron X-ray system (Faxitron X-ray Corp, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA) for 20-second exposures at 25&#x02009;kV. Micro-computed tomography (&#x003bc;CT 40, Scanco Medical AG, Wayne, PA, USA) was performed on the tibia or the femur. Both procedures were performed on post-mortem tissues. Quantification of the cancellous bone was assessed by measuring 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;CT slices (1.6&#x02009;mm) immediately below the growth plate, whereas the total metaphyseal bone mass was calculated by including both cortical and cancellous bone in those &#x003bc;CT slices, both with a threshold of 240. For cortical bone parameters, 50&#x02009;&#x003bc;CT slices (0.8&#x02009;mm) from locations as indicated in the text were analyzed, with a threshold of 260.

Long bone sections were deparaffinized, briefly incubated in 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in methanol and rinsed in deionized water. The sections were first blocked with 5% normal serum and then incubated in biotinylated sclerostin antibody (BAF1589, R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) at 1:500 in blocking solution. Streptavidin-HRP antibody and DAB substrate kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) were used according to manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. For negative control, the primary antibody was omitted from the procedure. For immunofluorescence detection of both human and murine sclerostin, a polyclonal antibody (ab75914, Abcam), together with Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (A21246, Invitrogen), was used on frozen sections of the femur from P33 mice. A non-immune IgG (5415S, Cell Signaling Technology) was used as negative control. For preparation of frozen sections, dissected bones were fixed with 4% PFA overnight at room temperature and incubated in 14% EDTA for 3 days with daily change of solution.

Because we have previously analyzed the CKO mice at 33 days of age (P33), we conducted the current study at the same age to ensure consistency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> The <italic>Dmp1-Cre</italic> transgene expresses Cre from a 9.6-kb Dmp1 promoter sequence, and the Bmpr1a<sup>f</sup> allele has the second exon floxed and results in a complete loss of function when excised by Cre. Immunohistochemistry confirmed osteocytes as the predominant cell type expressing SOST in both cortical and cancellous bone of the control mice (<italic>Bmpr1a<sup>f/f</sup></italic>) at P33 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, middle). In contrast, SOST was barely detectable in the same cell type of the CKO littermate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, right). Western blot analyses of protein extracts from the long bones corroborated the virtual absence of SOST in the CKO samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). These results therefore confirm that SOST is markedly reduced in the Bmpr1a-deficient bones.</p><p>We next tested whether SOST downregulation was responsible for the bone phenotypes in the CKO mice. To this end, we took advantage of the <italic>Dmp1-SOST</italic> transgenic mouse that expresses the human <italic>SOST</italic> cDNA from a <italic>Dmp1</italic> regulatory sequence and therefore is expected to maintain SOST levels in osteocytes in the CKO mice. Previous characterization of the <italic>Dmp1-SOST</italic> mouse indicated that modest expression of SOST from the transgene reduced cancellous bone mass without affecting overall bone resorption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> In our mating scheme, four relevant genotypes were produced at an equal Mendelian ratio of 1/4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). We first imaged the littermate mice at P33 with X-ray, and found that the bones of the <italic>Dmp1-SOST</italic> mice were largely normal (SOST versus CTRL), but all CKO mice presented similar abnormal bone morphology regardless of <italic>Dmp1-SOST</italic> (SOST;CKO versus CKO; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). In particular, the CKO and the SOST;CKO mice exhibited a smaller bone diameter at the proximal metaphysis of the femur (red arrow) and throughout the tibia when compared to the control (CTRL) or SOST littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Imaging and quantification of the cortical bone with &#x003bc;CT confirmed that the overall bone size (Tt. Ar) was smaller at the proximal femur (red arrow) in the CKO and the SOST;CKO mice, but the bone area (Ct. Ar) was normal, resulting in a smaller medullary space (Ma. Ar) than CTRL or SOST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c and d</xref>). Thus, forced expression of SOST does not rescue the cortical bone phenotype caused by Bmpr1a deletion.</p><p>The X-ray images revealed that the cancellous bone region in the SOST;CKO mice was consistently shorter and less radiopaque than that in the CKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, green line). We therefore examined the metaphyseal region of the femur in more detail with &#x003bc;CT. We confirmed that the SOST mice had considerably less cancellous bone than the CTRL littermate, as indicated by both 3D reconstruction images and quantification of the cancellous bone parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a and b</xref>). The reconstruction images also revealed that both CKO and SOST;CKO mice possessed much more bone than either CTRL or SOST littermates, but the SOST;CKO mice exhibited considerably more marrow space within the cancellous bone region than the CKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, asterisks). Due to the fact that cancellous versus cortical bone could not be reliably distinguished in the CKO and the SOST;CKO mice, we measured the total metaphyseal bone mass across all four genotypes. Such measurements detected no significant difference in BV/TV between CTRL and SOST mice, indicating that the difference in cancellous bone between the two was obscured by the inclusion of the cortical bone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). However, the SOST;CKO mice had significantly less metaphyseal bone mass (BV/TV) than the CKO littermate, although still more than CTRL or SOST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). The SOST transgene also significantly reduced trabecular number (Tb. N) and increased trabecular separation (Tb. Sp) in the CKO background. Overall, SOST expression partially corrects the phenotype of high cancellous bone mass caused by Bmpr1a deletion.</p></sec><sec><title>Bmp signaling restricts preosteoblast proliferation partly through SOST induction</title><p>We next investigated further the effect of SOST on the cancellous bone phenotype. Serum CTX-I assays detected no difference among all four genotypes, indicating that suppression of bone resorption was unlikely to be the main mechanism for the excessive bone mass caused by Bmpr1a deletion, or the partial rescue by SOST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Histology of the femur confirmed the presence of more marrow space within the cancellous bone region of the SOST;CKO than the CKO mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, &#x0201c;M&#x0201d;). However, similar to the CKO littermates, the SOST;CKO mice showed an accumulation of osteoblasts between the neighboring trabeculae in areas devoid of bone marrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, arrow). In addition, SOST overexpression did not alter the osteocyte density that was markedly increased by Bmpr1a deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c and d</xref>, CKO vs SOST;CKO). Likewise, SOST did not modify the marked decrease in periosteal osteoblast activity as determined by calcein double labeling in the CKO background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e and f</xref>, CKO vs SOST;CKO). Immunofluorescence staining with an antibody recognizing both murine and human sclerostin indicated that the protein was elevated in the osteocytes of both cancellous and cortical bone in the SOST;CKO over the CKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). It should be noted, however, that the overall level of sclerostin in the SOST;CKO mice was still lower than that in CTRL. This result is consistent with our previous characterization that the Dmp1-SOST transgene is expressed at a relatively low level. Nonetheless, these results demonstrate that forced expression of SOST was sufficient to reduce cancellous bone formation in the Bmpr1a-deficient mice.</p><p>As we have previously shown that Bmpr1a deletion stimulates proliferation of preosteoblasts to increase cancellous bone formation, we next examined the effect of SOST expression on cell proliferation with the EdU labeling technique. The method detected a relatively low proliferation index (~5% EdU<sup>+</sup>) among all cells within the chondro-osseous junction in both wild-type and SOST mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a and b</xref>, CTRL vs SOST). Double labeling with an Osx antibody showed that the Osx<sup>+</sup> preosteoblasts also proliferated at relatively low rate in either wild-type or SOST mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c and d</xref>, CTRL, SOST). However, Bmpr1a deletion markedly increased the proliferation index among either all cell or the Osx<sup>+</sup> preosteoblasts at the chondro-osseous junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b and d</xref>, CKO vs CTRL). Importantly, the increased proliferation caused by Bmpr1a deletion was notably reduced by SOST overexpression even though the labeling index remained significantly higher than that in the CTRL or SOST mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b and d</xref>). Statistical analyses with two-way analysis of variance indicated a significant effect of SOST overexpression on Bmp1a deletion (interaction <italic>P</italic>-value &#x0003c;0.001). We confirmed the specificity of the Osx antibody, as a non-immune IgG did not detect any positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). Thus, forced expression of SOST partially suppresses hyperproliferation of osteoblast precursors caused by Bmpr1a deletion.</p></sec><sec><title>High bone mass allele of Lrp5 does not rescue periosteal bone growth in Bmpr1a-deficient mice</title><p>The data so far indicate that SOST downregulation does not contribute to the periosteal growth defect caused by Bmpr1a deletion. This result is expected as SOST generally suppresses bone formation through inhibition of Wnt signaling. We next tested whether hyperactivation of Wnt signaling could overcome the deficit in periosteal growth. To this end, we utilized the <italic>Lrp5<sup>A214V/+</sup></italic> knock-in mouse that expresses from the endogenous Lrp5 locus a mutant Lrp5 allele (A214V) that is known to increase Wnt signaling and cause high bone mass (HBM) in humans and mice. We generated littermate animals with or without the HBM Lrp5 allele expressed in either wild-type or Bmpr1a-deficient background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). X-ray imaging at P33 detected an increase in the cortical thickness of the long bones in the HBM mice over the control littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>, CTRL vs HBM). However, expression of the HBM allele did not rescue the cross-sectional size of the cortical bone in the Bmpr1a mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>, CKO vs HBM; CKO, red arrows). Quantitation of the tibial cortical bone at the tibia-fibula junction with &#x003bc;CT confirmed that the cross-sectional size (Tt. Ar) was similarly reduced by Bmpr1a deletion regardless of the HBM allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>, left). However, the HBM allele increased the cortical thickness (Ct. Ar) in both control and Bmpr1a-deficient mice, resulting similar decreases in the marrow space (Ma. Ar) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>, middle and right). Therefore, although hyperactivation of Wnt signaling promotes endosteal bone formation, it does not rescue periosteal bone growth in the absence of Bmpr1a. To establish further the efficacy of the Lrp5 HBM allele in our experimental setting, we analyzed the trabecular bone phenotype in the HBM versus control mice. Histology showed a clear increase in trabecular bone mass in both primary and secondary ossification centers of the tibia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>). Quantitative analyses of the proximal tibia with &#x003bc;CT revealed a twofold increase in trabecular bone mass (BV/TV) in HBM over control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>). Overall, based on this and our previous study, we propose a model wherein Bmp signaling regulates cancellous bone formation by both enhancing osteoblast activity and restricting preosteoblast proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> The proliferation constrain is at least partly mediated by the induction of SOST in osteocytes but may also involve direct Bmp action on the preosteoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7f</xref>). The proposition of direct inhibition of preosteoblast proliferation by Bmp is based on the fact that hyperproliferation was not fully corrected by the forced expression of SOST, but we cannot rule out that the lack of a full rescue might be due to the relatively low expression of SOST as previously documented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> We further propose that Bmp promotes periosteal bone growth mainly through direct stimulation of osteoblast activity largely independent of Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7f</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We have investigated the role of Wnt signaling in mediating Bmpr1a function in bone. Specifically, we tested whether genetic manipulation of Wnt signaling could modify the bone phenotypes caused by Bmpr1a deletion, namely excessive accrual of cancellous bone and impaired periosteal growth of cortical bone. Whereas forced expression of SOST partially rescued the cancellous bone mass, a hyperactive form of Lrp5 did not ameliorate the defect in periosteal bone growth in the Bmpr1a-deficient background. Mechanistically, SOST alleviated the hyperproliferation of cancellous preosteoblasts caused by Bmpr1a deletion. These results demonstrate that Bmp signaling regulates bone formation through both Wnt-dependent and -independent mechanisms.</p><p>It is worth noting that Bmp signaling appears to exert different effects on endosteal versus periosteal bone growth. Although the deletion of Bmpr1a notably restricted periosteal bone growth throughout the tibia, it did not reduce the total amount of cortical bone. In calcein labeling experiments, we frequently observed double-labeled surfaces at the endosteum of the diaphysis in the CKO but not the wild-type mice at P33, indicating an increase of active osteoblasts over the quiescent lining cells on the endosteal bone surface in the absence of Bmpr1a. The reasons for the increase in active endosteal osteoblasts however, are currently unclear. Aside from the potential direct effects of Bmpr1a deletion, we suspect that an increase in mechanical stress due to the reduced cross-sectional bone size may prolong the productive life span of endosteal osteoblasts. The mechanical stress response model is appealing as it helps to explain the normal, but not excessive cortical bone mass in the CKO mice; this is an intriguing distinction from the HBM mice that possess an abnormally high amount of cortical bone mass even though the overall sectional size of the bone is normal at P33 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). Regardless of the exact mechanism, hyperactive Wnt signaling by the mutant Lrp5 stimulated excessive endosteal bone formation regardless of Bmpr1a. Thus, whereas Bmpr1a is epistatic to Wnt in stimulating periosteal bone growth, the opposite appears to be true in regards to endosteal bone formation.</p><p>The study has also revealed different responses by cancellous versus cortical bone to perturbation of Wnt signaling. Expression of SOST or the mutant Lrp5 reduced or increased cancellous bone mass, respectively, demonstrating a stimulatory effect of Wnt signaling in the cancellous bone compartment. In contrast, neither manipulation had any effect on the cross-sectional size of the long bones by postnatal 33 days, indicating the relative independence of periosteal bone growth on the level of Wnt signaling. As others have reported that the same mutant Lrp5 (A214V) leads to bigger bone sizes in 4-month-old mice, bone expansion at the periosteum may be more sensitive to hyperactive Wnt signaling in adults than in young animals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> Recently, deletion of Sfrp4, a secreted antagonist of Wnt proteins, was shown to increase cancellous bone volume but reduce cortical thickness while expanding the cross-sectional size, perhaps though compartment-specific regulation of Bmp signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> Further studies are warranted to elucidate fully the molecular basis for site-specific effects of Wnt perturbation on bone resorption and formation.</p><p>We have focused our study on the regulation of bone formation by Bmp signaling. Others have reported a similar increase in cancellous bone mass following deletion of <italic>Bmpr1a</italic> with <italic>Col1-Cre<sup>ER</sup></italic> or <italic>Dmp1-Cre</italic> but attributed the phenotype mostly to the suppression of bone resorption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>

On the other hand, it is possible that the status of bone resorption in the mutant mice changes with age, as others noted a decrease of serum CTX-I levels in the CKO mice at 16 weeks of age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> Of note, deletion of <italic>Bmpr1a</italic> or <italic>Smad4</italic> in mature osteoblasts (<italic>Og2-Cre</italic>) also led to a decrease in bone resorption most notable in the aged mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> Thus, whereas increased osteoblast number appears to drive the excessive cancellous bone mass early in life in the CKO mice, a decrease in bone resorption could exacerbate the phenotype in aged mice.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by NIH grants AR060456 and AR055923 (FL).

(<bold>f</bold>) Model for Bmp signaling in osteoblast lineage cells. Bmp signaling via Bmpr1a directly promotes osteoblast activity in both trabecular and periosteal bone. Bmp also acts on osteocytes to induce SOST that in turn suppresses preosteoblast proliferation in trabecular bone region. On the other hand, production of periosteal osteoblasts is not altered by increased Wnt signaling. Trabecular versus periosteal osteoblast lineage is depicted in green versus blue. Red arrow and blocked arrow indicate stimulation and inhibition, respectively. Dashed line indicates potential action.

On 2 December 2017, seven heads of United Nations agencies said that a partial lifting of the blockade in November to allow humanitarian deliveries would not prevent &#x0201c;a massive humanitarian tragedy costing millions of lives&#x0201d; in Yemen.

Deaths reached 445 000 in 2016, a similar estimate to the previous year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) report.</p><p>While the incidence of new cases of malaria has fallen overall, the trend since 2014 has levelled off and even reversed in some regions. Malaria mortality followed a similar pattern, the report said.</p><p>&#x0201c;We are now at a turning point. Without urgent action, we risk going backwards, and missing the global malaria targets for 2020 and beyond,&#x0201d; said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO.</p><p>The WHO <italic>Global technical strategy for Malaria</italic> calls for reductions of at least 40% in malaria case incidence and mortality rates by the year 2020. According to the report, the world is not on track to meet these goals.</p><p>A major problem is insufficient funding at both domestic and international levels, resulting in gaps in coverage of insecticide-treated nets, medicines, and other life-saving tools. </p><p>An estimated US$ 2.7 billion was invested in malaria control and elimination efforts globally in 2016, far short of the US $6.5 billion annual investment needed by 2020 to meet the 2030 targets of the WHO global malaria strategy.</p><p>In 2016, governments of endemic countries provided US$ 800 million, representing 31% of total funding.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bit.ly/2inCEUM">http://bit.ly/2inCEUM</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>Europe&#x02019;s HIV epidemic</title><p>WHO&#x02019;s European Region is the only region worldwide where the number of new HIV infections is rising, HIV surveillance data from 2016 showed.</p><p>More than 160 000 people were newly diagnosed across the 53-country region, according to a joint HIV surveillance report by the WHO Regional Office for Europe and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control released ahead of World AIDS Day on 1 December 2017.</p><p>More than half (51%) of the new HIV cases reported in 2016 indicated that they were detected at a late stage of infection.</p><p>&#x0201c;The HIV epidemic continues to rise at an alarming pace in the European Region, mostly in its eastern part, which is home to almost 80% of the 160 000 new HIV diagnoses,&#x0201d; said Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO Regional Director for Europe.</p><p>&#x0201c;This is the highest number of new cases ever recorded in one year [in the WHO European region].

They often occur due to low access, weak technical capacity and poor governance, including corruption.</p><p>To coincide with the release of the studies, WHO published a compilation of about 1500 case reports of substandard and falsified medical products it has received since 2013, when the WHO Global Surveillance and Monitoring System was established.</p><p>These case reports are from all six WHO regions and cover a wide range of products from cancer treatments to contraception, both branded and generic. The most commonly reported reports were of substandard or falsified antimalarials and antibiotics.</p><p>WHO has trained 550 regulators from 141 countries over the last four years to detect and control these products.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bit.ly/2iQ2Mv8">http://bit.ly/2iQ2Mv8</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>Yellow fever in Nigeria</title><p>The International Coordinating Group on vaccine provision for yellow fever has provided 1.4 million vaccine doses for an immunization campaign that started on 2 December to help quell an outbreak in Nigeria.</p><p>The Nigerian government planned to vaccinate 1.3 million people in parts of Zamfara state in northwestern Nigeria, where cases of the mosquito-borne disease have been confirmed, with support from WHO and other partners.</p><p>A pre-emptive campaign to protect people in areas at high risk of yellow fever transmission is also being planned.</p><p>The first case of yellow fever was confirmed in August 2017. Since then, 276 suspected cases have been reported in 14 states and, in addition, 30 confirmed cases have been reported in four of those states: Kogi, Kwara, Kano and Zamfara.</p><p>Some 874 000 people were immunized against the acute viral haemorrhagic disease in Kwara and Kogi states with International Coordinating Group vaccines.</p><p>The International Coordination Group coordinates the timely and equitable provision of vaccines during outbreaks. It maintains an emergency stockpile of six million doses of yellow fever vaccine, which is continually replenished.

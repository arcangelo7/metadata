Cardiovascular Surgery (Sociedad Latina de Cardiolog&#x000ed;a y Cirug&#x000ed;a Cardiovascular
Pedi&#x000e1;trica - SLCCCP) led a 5-day joint meeting held in Brazil, from October 24 to 28,
2017, enrolling 56 international guests from 14 countries, and 67 colleagues from 15
Brazilian states.</p><p>The event celebrated the 15<sup>th</sup> Annual Pediatric Cardiology International
Meeting of Ribeir&#x000e3;o Preto, in a university hub located 330 km Northeast of S&#x000e3;o Paulo. It
was attended by 116 people from nine countries and granted promotional spaces for
several non-governmental foundations dedicated to support children with heart disease in
Brazil.</p><p>The three-day SLCCCP Congress was preceded by the 5th International Pediatric Cardiology
Research Symposium that provided a unique forum for original basic and clinical studies
presentations by junior and senior investigators from international and Brazilian
centers. Among the eight junior presentations, one on lower extremity lymphatic vessel
dynamics in patients with total cavo-pulmonary connection, presented by a medical
student from Denmark, was selected as the best paper and the author received an award
during the Congress. The international senior speakers came from Aarhus, Denmark; Bonn,
Germany; Buenos Aires, Argentina and Boston, USA, whereas three colleagues from S&#x000e3;o
Paulo completed the program.</p><p>On the morning of the last day, the International Symposium on Extracorporeal Circulation
in Pediatric Cardiovascular Surgery, co-organized by Dr. Luiz Fernando Caneo, from InCor
S&#x000e3;o Paulo, wrapped up scientific activities. It covered recent advances in cerebral
neuroprotection, anesthesia in cardiac surgery, safety protocols for extracorporeal
circulation, and operating room teamwork. In addition to three national experts,
Perfusion Clinical Coordinator at Boston Children's Hospital, Greg Matte, and Prof.
Rodolfo Neirotti were the leading invited international speakers.</p><p>The Congress' comprehensive scientific program included round tables on transposition of
the great arteries (TGA), Ross and Ross-Konno operations, tetralogy of Fallot, Ebstein's
malformation, congenital heart disease (GUCH), congenitally corrected transposition of
the great arteries (CCTGA), Fontan-Kreutzer operation, mechanical circulatory support,
and interventional cardiology. The inclusion of international and Brazilian speakers as
well as two commentators from different countries in each round table was seminal to
encourage discussion and enhance the audience interest.</p><p>In addition, conferences, mini-conferences, special sessions, and oral and poster
presentations provided a diversity of captivating topics. Among them, the evidence-based
demonstration that pediatric cardiac surgery humanitarian programs contribute to the
human development index in emerging countries merits mention, an update of the World
Society of Cardiovascular Pediatric Surgery Database, a potpourri cardiac specimens
demonstration, evaluation of heart transplantation experiences in Argentina and Brazil,
advances in imaging technology, respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis, stem cell
therapy, operability limits in patients with congenital heart disease and pulmonary
hypertension and intraoperative myocardial protection in the neonate. Other themes worth
mentioning were an innovative investigation of the postoperative univentricular heart
circulation lymphatic physiopathology, with infrared fluorescence, results with a
patient cohort submitted to lymphatic decompression surgery, "How to do it" surgical
videos, an update on percutaneous arrhythmia ablation, and the pros and cons of
performing adult and pediatric cardiac surgery under the same roof.</p><p>The Society paid a much-deserved tribute to Guillermo Kreutzer, for his contribution to
the treatment of the univentricular heart, and invited Miguel Barbero-Marcial to present
his lifelong accomplishments and reflections on the specialty.</p><p>In the Society's Assembly many colleagues recognized the high standards of the scientific
program, the Congress venue and the meeting organization. Furthermore, we were honored
with the presidency of the SLCCCP during the 2017-2019 biennium, until the next meeting
in Buenos Aires.</p><p>After a special word of appreciation to the local nonprofit Sinh&#x000e1; Junqueira Foundation
that backed most of the meeting's budget, and before the farewell words by the
president, took place a Posthumous Homage delivered by Edmar Atik, from Brazil, to Pedro
Antonio S&#x000e1;nchez, a cardiologist from Spain and one of the ancestors of the SLCCCP.</p><p>The success of the meeting sends a valuable and persuasive message to the officials in
charge of the Brazil's public health system. Considering that the vast majority of
pediatric cardiology and pediatric cardiovascular surgery centers were established in
state capitals, mostly of them located in the coastal area, the up and coming centers,
like ours, that more recently start practicing in the country's interior, must be
properly recognized and better nourished. Indeed, these new units deliver high
complexity care for the local and regional population, and increase the capacity of the
Brazilian national health system to assist patients from remote regions of the
country.</p><p>Ribeir&#x000e3;o Preto, with the second largest affiliated tertiary hospital of the University of
S&#x000e3;o Paulo, is one such example. Its pediatric cardiology group members have obtained
postgraduate training in leading institutions abroad and are highly committed to
improving clinical results and academic achievements. All considered it is wise and
timely to start granting our centers and other similar centers the attention and longed
for the funding they need to expand and stand out.</p><p>Perseverance and experience accumulated over 14 years of putting together an annual
international meeting, a strong and official financial back up from a local private
institution, contributions from the University Hospital Foundation for Assistance and
Research (Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Apoio ao Ensino, Pesquisa e Assist&#x000ea;ncia do Hospital das Cl&#x000ed;nicas
da Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeir&#x000e3;o Preto da Universidade de S&#x000e3;o Paulo - FAEPA),
medical industry and private organizations, as well as the seminal encouragement of the
SLCCCP past presidents were our strongholds.</p><p>Behind the scenes, in an era of resource scarcity, we must praise the spirit of
friendship and cohesion from all the prominent international colleagues who promptly
accepted to come to Brazil without any financial help from the Congress, the same
holding true for the Brazilian colleagues. The cooperation and suggestions of Prof.
Rodolfo Neirotti, a native Spanish-speaking international leader of the specialty, and
the Danish group headed by Prof. Vibeke Hjortdal, the support of the Department of
Congenital Heart Disease and Pediatric Cardiology of the Sociedade Brasileira de
Cardiologia, and the Department of Pediatric Cardiovascular Surgery of the Sociedade
Brasileira de Cirurgia Cardiovascular were also primordial.</p><p>An in all, we must acknowledge the SLCCCP's widespread recognition by other important
peer organizations and by its many Latin languages speaking teams, most of them
suffering the tribulations of being part of the underdeveloped world. By avoiding
favoritism and inequality, it became a cherished bastion to the advancement of knowledge
and highly praised and beloved by its fellow members whose generosity, truly unselfish
behavior, exemplary solidarity and an ever-increasing friendship allowed us to put
together such a great event.</p><p>The author wishes to thank Prof. Rodolfo Neirotti for revising the manuscript and for his
thoughtful comments.</p></body></article>

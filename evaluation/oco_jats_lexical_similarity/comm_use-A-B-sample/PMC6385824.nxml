children operated on at the age of 14 months and 11 years old for congenital
aneurysm of the right atrium are reported. Both presented cardiomegaly and
symptoms of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Diagnosis was established
by echocardiography. Surgical resection was successful. Both patients are free
of symptoms and their chest X-ray and echocardiogram are normal. The first

It was
firstly described and surgically corrected by Bailey<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> in 1955. In an extensive
survey of the international literature from 1955 to 1988, Binder et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> found 60 reported cases of right atrial aneurysm
from which only 17 (28%) had been submitted to surgical treatment. Subsequently,
sporadic cases have been described, including one of our
experience<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. In this article, we not only present another case,
but probably more relevant, we describe the late results (17 years) of the surgery
in the previously reported child.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>CASES REPORT</title><p>Case 1 - A 14-months-old female patient was submitted to surgical excision of a right
atrial aneurysm on March 30, 1999<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. The diagnosis of congenital heart disease had
been suspected by ultrasonography during fetal life. She was admitted to the
emergency room of our institution presenting a paroxysmal supraventricular
tachycardia which subsided with digoxin. Subsequently, she presented several
episodes of arrhythmia. Physical examination was normal. Chest X-rays showed marked
cardiomegaly. The electrocardiogram was normal. Echocardiogram demonstrated a
massively dilated right atrium without any intracardiac abnormalities.
Cineangiography confirmed the presence of a large aneurysm on the right atrium.
Surgery was performed through a median sternotomy and normothermic cardiopulmonary
bypass. The entire right atrium body was aneurismatic, but the atrial appendage was
normal. The aneurysm was resected as much as necessary to simulate a normal-sized
right atrium. The resected tissue measured 11 x 6 cm. The remaining right atrium was
closed with a continuous 6-0 Prolene suture. The postoperative course was
uneventful. She is now a 19-years-old health woman who had a normal pregnancy a year
ago bearing a normal child. No episode of arrhythmia has occurred. Chest X-rays
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>), electrocardiogram, and
echocardiogram are normal.</p><p><fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Chest X- rays of cases 1 and 2. Case 1: (a) Normal post-operative chest

congenital aneurysm of the right atrium was referred to our institution for surgical
treatment. He had symptoms of frequent palpitations. Physical examination was
normal, except for a systolic murmur grade 3/6 heard at the tricuspid area. The
electrocardiogram was normal. The chest X-ray showed enlargement of the cardiac area
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>). Echocardiogram revealed
aneurysmal dilatation of the right atrium and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. On
November 24<sup>th</sup>, 2016, the patient underwent surgical correction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). Under conventional cardiopulmonary
bypass, the right atrial aneurysm was resected. The tricuspid valve was normal, but
the annulus was dilated and a ring annuloplasty was performed. The postoperative
course was uneventful. Chest X-ray (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>)
and echocardiogram are normal.</p><p><fig id="f2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Intraoperative photographs of case 2. (a) View after the median

congenital enlargement of the right atrium is rare. In our institution, over a
period of 30 years (1987-2017), during which more than 23.000 cardiac operations
have been performed, we have seen only 2 cases of such anomaly.</p><p>Right atrial aneurysms have been documented from neonatal to adult
life<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. In our cases, the suspicion of a cardiac anomaly
was made during ultrasonography at gestation. Patients with right atrial aneurysms
may be asymptomatic, but more frequently, as in our 2 children, they present
supraventricular arrhythmias. This is probably the result of severe atrial
dilatation since patients regained normal sinus rhythm after surgical removal of the
aneurysm. Another possible complication is the formation of mural thrombus in the
right atrium<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Massive dilatation of the right atrium may be
associated with tricuspid annular dilatation and regurgitation requiring tricuspid
annuloplasty. It did occur in our second patient.</p><p>In asymptomatic individuals, the diagnosis is suspected by the presence of
cardiomegaly on chest radiography. Echocardiography may be the preferred method of
diagnosis excluding other conditions such Ebstein's anomaly, pericardial effusion,
pericardial cysts, and tumors. In a few cases, computed tomography, magnetic
resonance imaging, and selective cineangiocardiography may be used to establish
definitive diagnosis.</p><p>The analyses of the literature show that there is no unified opinion about the
treatment of patients with aneurysm of the right atrium. Patients with arrhythmia
have been treated surgically. Conservative approach is suggested to asymptomatic
patients diagnosed with mild or moderate dilatation. We have advocated surgical
treatment to all patients to prevent further dilatation of the right atrium and to
avoid unexpected life-threatening complications. Moreover, the procedure has a low
surgical risk<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> and the late results of surgery observed in our
first patient, 17 years after operation, suggest that resection of the right atrial
aneurysm is a curative procedure.</p><table-wrap id="t1" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="5%" span="1"/><col width="95%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HM</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Substantial contributions to the

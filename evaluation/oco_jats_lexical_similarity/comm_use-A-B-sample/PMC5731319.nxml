problems in some cases. These problems occur particularly in patients who are
currently using anticoagulants, in those who present coagulopathy, and also in those
cases in which vascular prostheses are necessary<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. In the latter case, there may be bleeding problems in the
needle hole. Certainly, tissue adhesives (TA) may be used as sealants to drop or
avoid undesirable bleeding which can lead to morbidity and mortality rise. However,
there is a range of products and, consequently, the need of an effective evaluation
of a likely advantage from the TA use to avoid leakage in sutures is widely
recognized<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Whenever TA
is used as a complement to sutures, the TA should allow a bleeding-free artery
closure, as well as through the needle holes. The present study aims to verify, on
practical basis, the effectiveness of a biological origin adhesive, as well as a
synthetic origin adhesive in sealing arterial sutures. This verification was done by
checking the higher intravascular pressure level that can be supported before
leakage occurs in the treated site, in order to compare the effectiveness of the two
adhesives and to check if the adhesives penetrate in the inner surface of the vessel
through the suture site.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>The present study has been granted by the local Research Ethics Committee (CEUA-FMJ
no. 230/2012). Segments of the abdominal infrarenal aorta were removed from
slaughtered adult pigs (around 90 kg) in a slaughterhouse and promptly taken to the
Surgical Technique Laboratory. These segments were prepared through adjacent tissue
removal (keeping the adventitious layer tied to aorta) and through emergent branches
tied with 4-0 cotton suture. One edge of the "Y" polypropylene tube (Compojet
Biom&#x000e9;dica, BA, Brazil) was firmly tied to the lumen of the aorta through 2-0
cotton suture. The aorta distal segment edge was fully occluded through a vascular
clamp. After that, a saline solution at 0.9% NaCl was injected into the aorta
segment in order to verify if there was any leakage through branches of the aorta
and, in case of leakage, fix it (4-0 cotton suture). Whenever the aorta segments
were leakage-free, a 100 mm longitudinal incision with no. 11 scalpel blade was done
in each of them; this incision was sutured with a 7-0 polypropylene suture
(Prolene<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Johnson &#x00026; Johnson, Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil)
by a trained surgeon with binocular magnification x 2.5 loupes (Heine Optotechnik
GmbH &#x00026; Co KG<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Germany). Then, the aorta segments were
considered prepared for the experiment.</p><sec><title>Bursting Pressure Test</title><p>In each prepared segment of the aorta, 6% of hidroethylamin solution
(Voluven<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Fresenius Kabi, Barueri, Brazil) + 1 ml of 1%
methyltioninium chloride (Azul de Metileno ADV<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Sao Paulo,
Brazil) were injected through a "Y" catheter; the other end of the catheter was
attached to a tensiometer (Missouri, table model, Mikatos Ind. Com., Sao Paulo,
Brazil) to verify the intraluminal pressure. The objective of adding
hidroethylamin is to make easier the visualization of fluid leakage. In ten
aorta segments, the solution was injected slowly until the leakage occurs at the
arterial suture site (Suture 1 group). The bursting pressure value was the mmHg
pressure in which leakage occurred at the suture site. Then a fibrin patch was
placed in the vessel at the suture site (Fibrin group) and, again, the bursting
pressure was checked to see if there was any change in mmHg values. Also in
another ten prepared segments of the aorta in which the arteriorrhaphy was
already done, the solution was injected and the bursting pressure values were
registered (Sutured 2 group). Thereafter, a film of cyanoacrylate adhesive was
placed in the suture site and a new bursting pressure test was done
(Cyanoacrylate group). The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>

performance and, due to this fact, many evaluation models have been
proposed<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. TA
effectiveness would be better assessed by whether or not leakage of remaining fluids
occurred. This endpoint, which can be easily and quickly checked, is, in most of
circumstances, the clinically desirable endpoint<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>For this study, an objective evaluation method was chosen, a method that is similar
to that already utilized by Myers et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> (to evaluate the effectiveness of suture types) and by
Flahiff et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> (to evaluate the
effectiveness of the fibrin patch). This method consists of measuring the
intraluminal pressure limit, in which the repair in the vessel area is sustained
until leakage of intravascular fluid occurs through the suture line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>

</p><sec><title>Choice of Method for the Comparative Test</title><p>An <italic>ex vivo</italic> model can present a different performance when
compared to an <italic>ex vivo</italic> model because there is no blood flow. A
blood-flowing free tissue can compromise or raise the adhesive strength of some
sealants, because some TAs depends on physical mechanisms to promote
adhesiveness and other TA depend on enzymatic processes to work. Another
critical parameter is the temperature. The impact of low temperatures could
compromise the surgical adhesiveness of some sealants, presumably with a more
emphatic impact in sealants which depend on human enzymatic activity<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.The long-term response of the
host tissue cannot be studied in the <italic>ex vivo</italic> model. Thus, these
kinds of studies should use an animal model which can survive to evaluate the
strength of cohesion over time, as well as the inflammatory markers. The
selection of the animal model for leakage tests after the use of TA still
remains a problem to be solved<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. Chvapil et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> remind that, despite of the fact that several species
of animals have been utilized to study bleeding, there are relevant
hematological differences among animal species. Thus, the dog, for instance,
presents higher platelet adhesion than the human. Bruck<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> suggested that primate animals
would be best suitable for testing because the blood and hemorrhage of these
animals would best resemble the physiological characteristics of blood and
bleeding in humans. However, these types of experiments would be impossible on
the current days due to ethics evolution concerned with animal research and
legislation. Therefore, the alternative for researchers is to perform tests
using synthetic substances or biological tissue (<italic>ex vivo</italic>).</p></sec><sec><title>Choice of Tissue Adhesives to Be Tested</title><p>The TA can be divided into two basic categories according to their origin,
biological origin and synthetic origin. The main representative of the
biological origin TA is the fibrin adhesive and the synthetic origin TA is the
cyanoacrylate. The fibrin adhesive is made up of two basic components, the
thrombin and the fibrinogen. The fibrinogen is the source of fibrin which
represents the basic clotting element. Each of these ingredients is put into
syringes apart from each other displayed side by side in a system that allows
the mixing of the products only by the moment of application. The components
interact along the application to form a stable fibrin clot. The relative rate
of thrombin is that which will determine the rate of clot formation and the
adhesion strength by the final phase of fibrin application<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. As fibrin adhesives simulate the last clotting phase,
they are autonomous and independent of body coagulation and, as a result, are
also effective in patients who present coagulopathy as well in those who have
been receiving anticoagulants<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In contrast to synthetic adhesives, fibrin adhesives present the advantage of
being biocompatible and biodegradable. The fibrin clot is reabsorbed within days
or weeks as part of a normal wounds healing process. Macrophages and fibroblasts
absorb the fibrin adhesive completely within about two weeks after
application<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>. In this way, they are not
associated with inflammation, foreign body reaction, tissue necrosis or
extension of fibrosis<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>.
However, in an extent review over fibrin sealants, Spotnitz<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> demonstrated that, despite of
the fact that the fibrin has been used for more than 25 years, it is still
unclear whether it is actually effective in all types of suture.</p><p>Cyanoacrylates are liquid monomers which quickly polymerize when applied and then
they quickly promote the adhesion of two altogether surfaces or a surface seal.
Despite they were invented in 1942, the first formulations degraded into toxic
products and only in 1998 new formulations became available, slowly degraded to
allow medical use<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>. The
advantages of the cyanoacrylates are fast application, the shortest repair
period, and an effective fluid barrier. Cyanoacrylate has been effective in
vascular reconstruction<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>, but there are still doubts
about the possibility of the product particles penetrating into the vessel and
then causing embolism<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>. The
arterial wall tissues are more "elastic" than the vascular graft tissues,
meaning that after the needle has crossed the arterial wall, a prompt tissue
approach around the hole occurs, promoting fast occlusion. This does not occur
in synthetic tissues grafts which present greater "memory" that maintain the
needle hole open, which leads a trend in allowing the fluid adhesive to flow
into the vessels in case of synthetic graft anastomosis<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>. It is also considered that
the application of cyanoacrylate can cause an intense inflammatory reaction in
the artery that reaches the internal wall of the vessels and this condition can
lead to thrombus formation<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>About the Results of the Present Study</title><p>The intraluminal pressure supported by suture was low in this experiment despite
of the fact that the suturing was carefully done. It is certainly due to the use
of a colloid solution rather than the use of blood with its coagulation factors.
The cyanoacrylate sealant that has been used presents low viscosity, which
permits a fast adhesion, but there is still a doubt about the limited
elasticity. Cyanoacrylate showed a high strength cohesive power and a high
bursting pressure in the present study, but it is also recognized for its
stiffness. Thus, the low flexibility of cyanoacrylate can explain the failure in
demonstrating its clinical advantages when compared to the lower cohesion
strength TA<sup>[<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>. The ideal TA
should have an elastic flexibility, similar to the surrounding tissue to
minimize the interface stress along the tissues drive<sup>[<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>. This would be a disadvantage of
cyanoacrylate. Kull et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>
investigated the properties of cyanoacrylate in comparison to the fibrin
adhesive and concluded that cyanoacrylate demonstrated a higher adhesion
potential than fibrin in an <italic>in vitro</italic> porcine skin study. Others
studies have also shown that cyanoacrylate adhesive has stronger power in
bonding or sealing other tissues as lung<sup>[<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> and colon<sup>[<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> compared with other products.</p><p>Barbalinardo et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> have
done the interposition of a 6 mm PTFE tube of iliac arteries utilizing sheeps
and have found that the adjacent use of cyanoacrylate in the suture was
effective as a synthetic graft anastomosis sealant. Saba et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> compared the graft
interposition through continuous suture with 5-0 polypropylene and with an
anastomosed suture-free graft with application of cyanoacrylate in the abdominal
aorta of dogs. They came to the conclusion that cyanoacrylate can be a good
alternative to do suture-free anastomosis. New studies will be necessary to
confirm this alternative.</p><p>In the present study, the penetration of any adhesive through suture line into
the artery segments did not occur. This fact confirms that the low viscosity of
these adhesives makes it safe to use vascular surgery under this point of view.
This study shows that cyanoacrylate adhesive provides higher bursting pressure
and can sustain intravascular pressures up to 220 x 100 mmHg (mean arterial
pressure 140 mmHg), even using a colloid solution instead of blood.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>There was a significant rise in the bursting pressure when tissue adhesives were used
as adjacent to arterial suture, and this rise was considerably higher if the
cyanoacrylate adhesive was used. The results show that the adhesives are effective
sealants in arterial sutures in <italic>ex vivo</italic> models. In addition, the
adhesives do not penetrate through suture line into the arteries.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="50%" span="1"/><col width="50%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MVHC</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Concept, design, acquisition, analysis and

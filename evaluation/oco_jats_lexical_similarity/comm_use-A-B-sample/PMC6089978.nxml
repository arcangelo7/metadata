Previous work has shown that R-spondin-2 (<italic>Rspo2</italic>, RSPO2) is both highly expressed in Wnt-stimulated pre-osteoblasts and its overexpression induces osteoblast differentiation in the same cells, supporting its putative role as a positive autocrine regulator of osteoblastogenesis. However, the role of Rspo2 in regulating osteoblastogenesis and bone formation in postnatal bone has not been explored. Here we show that limb-bud progenitor cells from <italic>Rspo2</italic> knockout mice undergo reduced mineralization during osteoblastogenesis in vitro and have a corresponding alteration in their osteogenic gene expression profile. We also generated the first <italic>Rspo2</italic> conditional knockout (Rspo2<sup>floxed</sup>) mouse and disrupted <italic>Rspo2</italic> expression in osteoblast-lineage cells by crossing to the Osteocalcin-Cre mouse line (Ocn-Cre&#x02009;+&#x02009;Rspo2<sup>f/f</sup>). Ocn-Cre&#x02009;+&#x02009;Rspo2<sup>f/f</sup> male and female mice at 1, 3, and 6 months were examined. Ocn-Cre&#x02009;+&#x02009;Rspo2<sup>f/f</sup> mice are decreased in overall body size compared to their control littermates and have decreased bone mass. Histomorphometric analysis of 1-month-old mice revealed a similar number of osteoblasts and mineralizing surface per bone surface with a simultaneous decrease in mineral apposition and bone formation rates. Consistent with this observation, serum osteocalcin in 3-month-old Ocn-Cre&#x02009;+&#x02009;Rspo2<sup>f/f</sup> was reduced, and bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells from Ocn-Cre&#x02009;+&#x02009;Rspo2<sup>f/f</sup> mice undergo less mineralization in vitro. Finally, gene expression analysis and immunohistochemistry of mature bone shows reduced beta-catenin signaling in Ocn-Cre&#x02009;+&#x02009;Rspo2<sup>f/f</sup>.

This decrement in bone mass and structure, and the concordant decrease in mechanical strength can be caused both by dysregulation of osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> Therapeutics to restore bone mass and strength therefore focus on targeting one of these two processes.</p><p id="Par4">A potent positive regulator of bone deposition by osteoblasts during bone modeling and remodeling is the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, making it a highly desirable target for therapeutics to increase bone formation. The Wnt pathway has been deeply investigated in the context of bone, focusing on both extracellular pathway modulators and the stabilization of beta-catenin and transcription factors, generally with increases in canonical signaling through the pathway leading to increased osteoblastogenesis and bone formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> Modulation of the pathway through antibodies targeting Sclerostin, an antagonist of canonical Wnt signaling in bone, has been particularly successful.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> These antibodies, along with PTH and PTHrP analogs teriparatide and abaloparatide, are currently the only FDA-approved osteoanabolic therapeutics; other interventions primarily focus on inhibiting further resorption of bone by osteoclasts, such as the bisphosphonates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> There remains a critical need for the identification of additional osteoanabolic therapeutic options given the clinical limitations of the currently available therapeutics.</p><p id="Par5">The R-spondin proteins, a family of four secreted matricellular proteins, potentiate Wnt signaling and may represent a novel focus of therapeutic targeting to modulate osteoblasts. The R-spondins activate canonical Wnt signaling by binding to the Leucine-Rich Repeat-Containing G-Protein Coupled Receptors 4&#x02013;6 (LGR4-6), which then interacts with the E3-Ubiquitin ligases ZNRF3/RNF43 to inhibit Wnt receptor turnover.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> R-spondins are also reported to activate non-canonical Wnt/Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> All four R-spondin family members have a similar modular domain structure: an N-terminal signal sequence, two furin-like/cysteine-rich domains, a thrombospondin type-1 motif (TSR1), and a basic amino acid rich C-terminus, which are encoded on separate exons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> Each of the R-spondins are expressed in the developing mouse limb, as well as in other tissues, and each has different functional effects with respect to the skeleton. R-spondin-1 (<italic>Rspo1</italic>) disruption is not associated with a skeletal phenotype, but its expression is induced during osteoblastogenesis and in response to vibration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> The <italic>Rspo2</italic> knockout mouse (Rspo2<sup>ftl</sup>) is perinatal lethal due to defective lung development and exhibits limb and craniofacial malformations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that <italic>Rspo2</italic> is highly expressed in Wnt11-overexpressing pre-osteoblasts.

However, differential modulation of the pathway by specific ligands and cofactors, such as R-spondins, is not well-characterized in adult bone. Here we have investigated the role of the Wnt agonist RSPO2 in osteoblastogenesis and in postnatal bone to elucidate its contribution to these processes. We utilized <italic>Rspo2</italic>-null limb bud progenitor cells isolated from Rspo2<sup>ftl</sup> mice for in vitro investigation.

Relatedly, BM-MSC obtained from Ocn-Cre&#x02009;+&#x02009;Rspo2f/f mice showed reduced osteogenesis, but basal expression of osteoblastic genes was unaltered. While Rspo2 expression is low in cells from recombined mice, there is no change in genes associated with beta-catenin signaling nor with osteoblastogenesis. Notably, RNA from cortical bone does show changes suggestive of alterations in beta-catenin signaling, and there is a reduction in active beta-catenin by immunohistochemistry. Despite the changes in beta-catenin signaling observed in vivo, genes associated with osteoblastogenesis remain unchanged in whole bone, similar to the gene expression analysis of BM-MSC. Future studies will need to more thoroughly dissect the transcriptional program associated with reduced Rspo2. These studies will need to be completed in the presence and absence of Wnt stimulation.</p><p id="Par25">Consistent with some of our gene expression data, <italic>Lrp5</italic> knockout calvarial osteoblasts had no change in the expression of <italic>Runx2</italic>, but did have a significant decrease in the expression of <italic>Osx</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> They also had decreased mineralization with no change in ALP staining, as we observed in the both the <italic>Rspo2</italic>-null limb bud progenitor cells and in BM-MSC. Comparatively, <italic>Lrp6</italic> knockout calvarial osteoblasts had reductions in both mineralization and ALP staining, as well as moderate decreases in the expression of <italic>Runx2</italic>, <italic>Osx</italic>, and <italic>Ocn</italic>, suggesting an even earlier and more sustained role for <italic>Lrp6</italic> in osteoblastogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> Clearly, the Ocn-Cre-driven <italic>Rspo2</italic> knockout shares some characteristics of Lrp5- and Lrp6-deficient mice, which could possibly be due to modulation of both <italic>Lrp5</italic> and <italic>Lrp6</italic> levels at the membrane. In this work we have not attempted to evaluate whether RSPO2 may modulate LRP5 and/or LRP6 specifically, but our data does suggest changes in beta-catenin signaling in vivo.</p><p id="Par26">In vivo, osteocalcin-Cre mediated <italic>Rspo2</italic> knockout resulted in a decrease in overall body mass and femur length. Via &#x003bc;CT analysis, we identified significant reductions in the trabecular bone volume fraction, trabecular thickness, and trabecular number, with modest reductions in cortical bone mass at the 3-month timepoint. The reduced bone mass is most pronounced at earlier timepoints (1 and 3 months of age), corresponding to the periods of highest growth and peak trabecular bone mass in mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> By 6-months, the differences in trabecular bone have lessened, and the cortical bone is no longer significantly different from WT littermates. Mechanical testing results support the significant differences seen in the cortical bone on microCT at 3 months of age. At 6 months of age, male mice also had significant reductions in the maximum load force and bending stiffness, while the &#x003bc;CT data only showed a trend toward reduction in cortical bone mass. The fact that the mechanical function is significantly different at 6 months, but microCT cortical parameters are not, is intriguing and may reflect that the three-point bending assesses whole bone properties while microCT evaluates a discrete portion of the analyzed cortical bone.</p><p id="Par27">Our histomorphometry data show that Ocn-Cre-driven <italic>Rspo2</italic> deficiency results in decreased mineral apposition and bone formation in 1-month-old mice, despite similar numbers of osteoblasts per bone surface, suggesting a deficiency in osteoblast activity. While there is an equivalent osteoblast/bone surface in the Ocn-Cre&#x02009;+&#x02009;Rspo2<sup>f/f</sup> mice, because WT mice have so much more bone surface, they do have more total osteoblasts and increases in labeled surfaces. These results correspond to our in vitro mineralization data for both the <italic>Rspo2</italic>-null limb bud progenitor cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) as well as BM-MSC from the targeted Rspo2<sup>floxed</sup> mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Intriguingly, 3-month-old WT mice no longer show increased MAR, but it is notable that WT mice show a 50% reduction in MAR from 1-month to 3-month, whereas the Ocn-Cre&#x02009;+&#x02009;Rspo2<sup>f/f</sup> show relatively small changes in MAR from 1-month to 3-months. This likely reflects declining bone formation as WT mice mature. Despite MAR and BFR not being different at 3-months of age, it is noted that there is an increase in serum osteocalcin in WT mice relative to Ocn-Cre&#x02009;+&#x02009;Rspo2<sup>f/f</sup> mice. This is an interesting observation and may reflect that there is more total bone surfaces with osteoblast activity in the WT than the Ocn-Cre&#x02009;+&#x02009;Rspo2<sup>f/f</sup>. WT mice have a 2.7-fold increase in total mineralizing surface over the Ocn-CreRspo2<sup>f/f</sup> mice, when mineralizing surface is not considered relative to total bone surface (data not shown).</p><p id="Par28">The Cre mouse used for disrupting Rspo2 in this study was developed by the Clemens laboratory over 15 years ago and has been used extensively to disrupt floxed alleles in studies of the osteoblast lineage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> However, very few Cre mice show perfectly discrete cell-type-specific expression, and indeed studies have shown that Cre expression can occur in cells other than mature osteoblasts. For example, Cre is also expressed in late hypertrophic chondrocytes, which may provide an explanation for the abnormality in the growth plate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> Indeed, deficiency of <italic>Rspo2</italic> in chondrocytes has been reported to decrease chondrocyte proliferation, but differences in protein expression in the hypertrophic zone were not noted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> However, canonical Wnt signaling is known to affect progression of chondrocytes through the growth plate, and, consistent with this, Lrp5 knockout mice also have shortened femoral length.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> Given that hypertrophic chondrocytes are known to transdifferentiate to osteoblasts, it is possible that the <italic>Rspo2</italic> deficiency hinders the activation of the pluripotent stem cell programs required for this process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> Future studies will need to examine the disruption of Rspo2 using additional promoter systems, and particularly using inducible Cre models, to determine an osteoblast autonomous role for Rspo2.</p><p id="Par29">The overall skeletal phenotype of the Ocn-Cre specific knockout of <italic>Rspo2</italic> is consistent with that seen in other disruptions of canonical Wnt signaling in bone, specifically that of <italic>Lrp5</italic> disruption, albeit somewhat attenuated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> Specifically, the Lrp5 knockout mouse has decreased bone mass, decreased mineral apposition rate, decreased osteoblast numbers, and decreased femoral length, all of which are similar to the phenotype seen with osteoblast-specific knockout of <italic>Rspo2</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> Despite these post-natal effects, overall skeletal development, similar to the osteoblast-specific <italic>Rspo2</italic> knockout reported here, but in contrast to the global <italic>Rspo2</italic> knockout, is relatively normal.

While LRP5/6 receptors on osteoblasts were not examined specifically, our data supports decreases in canonical beta-catenin signaling in vivo based on gene expression analysis and immunostaining. Additional studies utilizing combined knockouts of <italic>Rspo2</italic> with these receptors would help elucidate this interaction.</p><p id="Par30">The &#x003bc;CT results show consistently decreased trabecular bone in the 1-, 3-, and 6-month old mice, primarily due to decreased trabecular thickness. In WT bone from 3 to 6 months of age there is a net loss of trabecular bone, while the cortical bone expands.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> The phenotype of Rspo2-deficient mice does not increase in severity from 3 to 6 months, perhaps because of the net loss of trabecular bone that is occurring, particularly in WT mice. There is an increase in serum TRAP in 6-month-old mutant mice, but the significance of this is not known. This phenotype may be consistent with the <italic>Wnt10b</italic>-null mouse model in which the growth rate and bone mass are normal at 1 month of age, but progressive osteopenia develops thereafter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> A potential role for Rspo2 in the repression of osteoclastogenesis will need to be investigated further in studies that activate osteoclast activity, such as ovariectomy.</p><p id="Par31">While there is an apparent cortical bone phenotype based on both microCT and mechanical testing, it is arguably less severe than the trabecular phenotype. It is interesting to note that other models of deficient Wnt signaling have shown discrepancies between changes in trabecular and cortical bone. As an example, overexpression of <italic>Wnt10b</italic> increases trabecular bone, with minimal impact on cortical bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> Further studies to age our novel model to a geriatric timepoint are needed to determine the impact of <italic>Rspo2</italic>-deficieny on both trabecular and cortical bone.</p><p id="Par32">The decreased progenitor cell and pre-osteoblast populations as determined by CFU-F and CFU-AP respectively, are also somewhat unexpected given that osteoblast density is similar. However, as previously mentioned, it is important to realize that despite similar osteoblast density (osteoblasts per bone surface), in both 1-month-old and 3-month-old mice there is greater total osteoblasts. Disruption of canonical Wnt signaling has been shown to decrease progenitor cell number, such as in the <italic>Lrp5</italic>-knockout and the <italic>Wnt10b</italic>-knockout models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> However, high levels of expression of stabilized beta-catenin also decreased the number of CFU-F colonies, while lower levels of expression enhanced the proliferation of MSC thereby increasing these numbers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> In another study, addition of WNT3A, a stereotypically canonical Wnt ligand, increased both total number and percentage of ALP-positive colonies, while addition of WNT5A, a stereotypically noncanonical Wnt ligand, had no effect in this assay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> Clearly the tuning of specific Wnt ligands is critical to Wnt signaling&#x02019;s ultimate effects on progenitor cell renewal, proliferation, and differentiation. In our model, it is possible that a decreased number of osteoblast progenitors contributes to the development of the initial trabecular phenotype. This will require further investigation. Additionally, considering the reduced progenitor cell population, it is conceivable that mice with osteoblast deficiency in <italic>Rspo2</italic>, would have a reduced regenerative capacity when challenged with bone injury or may lose bone more quickly when challenged by aging or ovariectomy.</p><p id="Par33">Together, our data indicate that <italic>Rspo2</italic> modulates osteoblastogenesis and mineralization, both in vitro and in vivo. <italic>Rspo2</italic>-deficiency leads to decreased mineral apposition and bone formation rates, and thus to fewer and smaller trabeculae, decreased overall bone mass, and decreased bone strength. This specific phenotype is similar to other models that perturb the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, particularly those that disrupt receptors LRP5 and LRP6, supporting the canonical Wnt signaling pathway as the primary mechanism of RSPO2 activity in osteoblasts. Indeed, our in vivo results suggest that canonical Wnt signaling through beta-catenin stabilization is reduced in Rspo2-deficient mice. However, the clear differences between our model and previous models that disrupt specific Wnt ligands suggest that RSPO2 modulates the receptors that integrate the signal from many Wnt ligands rather than tuning one specific Wnt ligand-mediated signal. Given our reported reduction in bone mass is more modest compared to some of the other models that disrupt Wnt signaling, this could be beneficial as an option to more carefully tune the activity of osteoblasts therapeutically.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> In summary, we have established RSPO2 as an important modulator of bone mass via its regulation of osteoblast function in postnatal bone.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Animals</title><p id="Par34">Animals were group housed in specific-pathogen-free vivaria and all experiments were performed in accordance with institutional policies.

For long bone RNA, tibiae and femora were collected from Rspo2<sup>f/f</sup> and Ocn-Cre, Rspo2<sup>f/f</sup> mice from 6&#x02013;7 month old mice. Bone marrow and soft tissues were removed and clean intact bones were processed. Only the mid diaphyses were used to make RNA.

RNA was then precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in RNase free water, and quantity measured using Nanodrop. Equivalent quantities of RNA were reverse-transcribed to cDNA using the Applied Biosystems High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit. Gene expression was quantified using either a ViiA 7 or a 7500Fast Real Time PCR Systems (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix or SYBR Select Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). For each gene of interest, samples were analyzed in duplicate or triplicate and control wells were simultaneously analyzed to rule out DNA contamination and primer dimer binding. Proper amplicon production was confirmed by melt curve analysis.

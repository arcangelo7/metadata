However, the role of ALKBH1 and DNA N6-mA in regulating osteogenic differentiation is largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that the expression of ALKBH1 in human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) was upregulated during osteogenic induction. Knockdown of ALKBH1 increased the genomic DNA N6-mA levels and significantly reduced the expression of osteogenic-related genes, alkaline phosphatase activity, and mineralization. ALKBH1-depleted MSCs also exhibited a restricted capacity for bone formation <italic>in vivo</italic>. By contrast, the ectopic overexpression of ALKBH1 enhanced osteoblastic differentiation.

</sup> mice exhibited an incomplete condensation of mesenchymal cells during ossification, which is consistent with our hypothesis.</p><p>Recently, ALKBH1 was discovered as a demethylase for DNA N6-mA, thus offering a new perspective for DNA methylation. However, there is wide acceptance that the DNA methylation always occurs on the C5 position of cytosine residues in CpG sites in DNA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> Fu <italic>et al.</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> demonstrated that epigenetic activation of bone-specific genes mediated by promoter demethylation typically occurs when MSCs differentiate into osteoblasts. Moreover, Dansranjavin <italic>et al.</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> suggested that the inhibition of stem-cell-specific genes by promoter methylation is a crucial epigenetic mechanism during stem cell differentiation. In previous studies, Wu <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that an increase of N6-mA in Alkbh1<sup>
<italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic>
</sup> cells leads to gene silencing and that most of these genes are developmental factors and lineage-specifying genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> Intriguingly, these genes are most markedly enriched on the X chromosome and Chr13, indicating that the increase in N6-mA inhibits the transcription on X chromosome, especially on young full-length LINE-1 transposons (L1 elements).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> Taken together, these data indicate that accumulation of N6-mA at L1 elements is related to the inhibition of nearby gene. Thus, N6-mA modifications have a great influence on the activation of differentiation genes. It would be interesting to explore the relationship between ALKBH1 and N6-mA, and the mechanisms that affect osteogenic differentiation and bone formation. Our result indicated an inverse correlation between ALKBH1 and N6-mA. In addition, the depletion of ALKBH1 <italic>in vivo</italic> leads to less bone tissue and decreased bone formation. However, fewer papers on DNA demethylases have been published compared with RNA demethylases, which needs further exploration.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrated that ALKBH1 binds to the promoter region of <italic>ATF4.</italic> The lack of ALKBH1 restricted this binding and increased N6-mA in this region, which led to transcription silencing. Our outcome suggested that ALKBH1 removes the N6-mA on ATF4 to regulate the osteogenic differentiation of human MSCs. ATF4, an osteoblast-enriched transcriptional factor of the CREB family, is indispensable for the latest phases of osteogenic differentiation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></sup> bone formation, and mineralization of the ECM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> Previous studies have demonstrated that ATF4 promotes differentiation by upregulating the expression of osteoblast-specific genes, such as <italic>RANKL</italic>, and by promoting the synthesis of type I collagen, which is a main component of the ECM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> These two distinct mechanisms are both dependent on the phosphorylation by RSK2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref></sup> Taken together, these data suggested that ALKBH1 enhances osteogenic differentiation by interacting with <italic>ATF4</italic>.</p><p>It needs to be noted that our findings are based on the <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments.

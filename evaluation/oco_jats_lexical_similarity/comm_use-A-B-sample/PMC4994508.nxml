It remains unclear how T cells would respond when stimulated by multiple major histocompatibility complex (MHC) disparate alloantigens in the same cultures. In this report, we examined potential interactions of T cell clones that were stimulated simultaneously by two sets of complete MHC disparate alloantigens using mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). In this assay, we observed that proliferation of B6 lymphocytes (H-2b) stimulated by both BALB/c (H-2d) and C3H (H-2k) allogeneic cells was not increased but rather reduced as compared to B6 cells stimulated with either BALB/c or C3H allogeneic cells. Interestingly, interleukin (IL)-10 expressions at both protein level and mRNA level was significantly increased in cultures stimulated with the two MHC alloantigens, while IL-2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1;, transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b2;1 production did not show any differences. In addition, Foxp3 mRNA expression was comparable amongst all groups. In conclusion, we observed an inhibitory effect in T cell proliferation in response to multiple MHC mismatched alloantigens in MLR, and this effect might be associated with the upregulation of IL-10 expression.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Key words</title><kwd>Interleukin-10</kwd><kwd>T-lymphocytes</kwd><kwd>intraclonal competition</kwd><kwd>mixed lymphocyte reaction</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Interactions among different clones of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are found in many immune responses, including T cell development, maturation, reconstitution, antigen recognition and different stages of T cell activation, and such interactions play an important role in the sustaining of immunologic homeostasis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] Although co-operation and competition between different clones of T cells with the same epitope specificity has been well studied.

With the understanding of how the recognition of the MHC-antigen complex by the T-cell receptor (TCR) occurs, it became clear that the basis of T-cell alloreactivity in MLR was essentially similar to the recognition of the nominal peptide epitopes presented by self-MHC molecules.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] Thus, the MLR provides a simple and efficient <italic>in vitro</italic> model for the study of T-cell activation and proliferation.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the proliferation of T cells upon stimulation with two different alloantigens (MHC H-2d and H-2k) in the MLR model. In this setting, we assessed competition between two populations of T cells reactive to two sets of different allogeneic antigens. The lymphocytes stimulated with two different allogeneic antigens showed decreased proliferation compared to the groups triggered by a single antigen, which suggested a possibility that competition between the two populations of lymphocytes could inhibit the proliferation of both populations. The mRNA expression levels and the secretion of interleukin (IL)-10 were significantly increased in the lymphocytes that were exposed to both of the MHC antigens, thereby indicating that the upregulation of IL-10 might play a role in this competitive suppression effect.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animals</title><p>Eight- to ten-week-old inbred BALB/c (H-2d), C57B/L (H-2b) and C3H (H-2k) mice were purchased from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai Laboratory Animal Center.

TCRs with higher affinity had an activation advantage, and affinity competition was further observed during the development and maturation of lymphocytes. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] While mounting evidence suggests that in addition to competition between T-cell clones for the same epitope, T cells with distinct antigen specificity may compete with each other when encountering different antigens at the same time. In a transplantation immune reaction, the response to one mH antigen may dominate the response to others. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] Lee <italic>et al.</italic>, reported that the rejection of a composited tissue allograft was lower than the rejection of grafts of any tissue component alone.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] These phenomena suggest that competition between lymphocytes with different antigen specificities may reduce the total strength of the immune reaction, thus raising the possibility of a new approach for tolerance induction following transplantation.</p><p>MLR is a traditional <italic>in vitro</italic> model to assess antigen recognition and the activation and proliferation of T lymphocytes. Thus, examining the kinetic parameters of a MLR may provide evidence of the mechanisms responsible for T-cell activation <italic>in vivo</italic>. The affinity competition of T cells has been successfully exhibited in MLR, confirming it as a viable model for the study of intraclonal interactions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] Therefore, splenocytes with two different MHC phenotypes were used in the MLR as stimulators to observe the competition between the two groups of T lymphocytes that were reactive to these two antigens.</p><p>A repertoire of 0.5% to 2.0% cell clones in the T cell repertoire could be stimulated to enter proliferation by the MHC disparate stimulators in MLR.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] Therefore, if these cells were stimulated with splenocytes possessing two different MHC phenotypes, more T-cell clones should be activated. However, in our model, the proliferation reaction was not enhanced in this situation. In contrast, the proliferation of these T lymphocytes was slightly reduced. Thus, we speculated that intraclonal competition between the two populations of T cells might be occurring in the reaction.</p><p>Although the interaction between T cells with same epitope specificity has been finely elucidated and is closely related to TCR affinity competition and the activation of affinity-dependent IL-2 signaling, the mechanism of intraclonal competition between T cells with different antigen specificities remains unclear.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] Co-stimulating signal expression, cytokine response and the induction of regulatory T cells might be involved in these polyclonal interactions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]</p><p>IL-2 is one of the early cytokines in immune activation, and therefore is a sensitive measure of T-cell proliferation and differentiation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] Competition for IL-2 is involved in the intraclonal competition between CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with same antigen specificity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] However, Taams <italic>et al.</italic>, reported that the suppressive effect of polyclonal T cell responses was not due to passive IL-2 consumption or to T-cell cytolysis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] We also confirmed that the concentration of immune active cytokines such as IL-2 and TNF-&#x003b1; was equivalent among all MLR groups, thus the consumption of immune active cytokines is unlikely to be the mechanism of suppression in the clonal competition observed in this model.</p><p>In our experiments, the immune suppressive cytokine lL-10 was significantly upregulated at both protein level and mRNA level in the two antigen-stimulated group, suggesting a possibility that this proliferation inhibition in intraclonal competition is related to the upregulation of IL-10 in lymphocytes.</p><p>As a negative feedback regulation, activated Th cells secret large amounts of IL-10 to suppress the proliferation of T cells and to control the total strength of immune reaction.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] In this model, although the exact ratio and phenotype of the Th cells that secreted IL-10 in the MLR was not clear, there may be more Th cells activated by the simultaneous presence of two different antigens that could mediate the suppression of the primary T-cell reaction.</p><p>Another subset of IL-10-expressing lymphocytes is the CD4<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs, a group of T lymphocytes with strong immune regulatory functions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] However, the IL-10 expression of Tregs is mediated by TGF-&#x003b2;1, and natural Tregs promote the development of IL-10-producing Tregs from naive T cells.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] However, neither TGF-&#x003b2;1 secretion nor Foxp3 expression showed an increase in the lymphocytes stimulated with two antigens. Although the role of the Tregs in lymphocyte intraclonal competition remains controversial, the Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs did not appear to participate in proliferation inhibition in this model.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]</p><p>In conclusion, intraclonal suppression of T-cell proliferation was observed in the MLR in response to two sets of MHC incompatible allogeneic antigens. And this intraclonal competition may be related to the induction of IL-10 secretion. However, the exact mechanism remains to be determined.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>

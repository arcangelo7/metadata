Once released to circulation upon exercise or cold exposure, irisin stimulates browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) and uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression, leading to an increase in total body energy expenditure by augmented UCP1-mediated thermogenesis. It is currently unknown whether irisin is secreted by bone upon exercise or whether it regulates bone metabolism <italic>in vivo</italic>. In this study, we found that 2 weeks of voluntary wheel-running exercise induced high levels of FNDC5 messenger RNA as well as FNDC5/irisin protein expression in murine bone tissues. Increased immunoreactivity due to exercise-induced FNDC5/irisin expression was detected in different regions of exercised femoral bones, including growth plate, trabecular bone, cortical bone, articular cartilage, and bone&#x02013;tendon interface. Exercise also increased expression of osteogenic markers in bone and that of UCP1 in WAT, and led to bodyweight loss. Irisin intraperitoneal (IP) administration resulted in increased trabecular and cortical bone thickness and osteoblasts numbers, and concurrently induced UCP1 expression in subcutaneous WAT. Lentiviral FNDC5 IP administration increased cortical bone thickness. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies in bone cells revealed irisin increases osteoblastogenesis and mineralization, and inhibits receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclastogenesis. Taken together, our findings show that voluntary exercise increases irisin production in bone, and that an increase in circulating irisin levels enhances osteogenesis in mice.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Adipose tissue is a major endocrine organ that regulates energy balance and energy homeostasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> Two main types of adipose tissue have been identified, white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> WAT functions primarily to store excess energy in the form of triglycerides, whereas BAT is involved in non-shivering thermogenesis, energy dissipation as heat and determination of insulin sensitivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> The oxidation of lipids in BAT is regulated by direct sympathetic nervous system stimulation via norepinephrine and is accomplished by expression of the mitochondrial protein uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), which facilitates a proton leak across the mitochondrial membrane to release energy as heat and increase energy expenditure. WAT from certain depots contain &#x0201c;brite&#x0201d; adipocytes that upon stimulation can undergo a process referred to as &#x0201c;browning&#x0201d; where they take on characteristics of BAT, including the induction of UCP1 and the ability to dissipate energy through a thermogenic response.</p><p>Several reports support the notion that therapeutic strategies aimed at activating BAT activity or inducing WAT browning may counteract metabolic diseases such as obesity or type II diabetes (T2D), and could potentially ameliorate bone-loss-associated disorders. First, human BAT activity correlates inversely with energy metabolic impairment seen with aging, T2D, and obesity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> and directly with high bone mineral density in healthy young women<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> or with total cortical bone cross-sectional area in young children and adolescents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> Second, WAT browning induction or activating BAT activity have been shown to suppress metabolic symptoms associated with obesity and T2D,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> whereas genetic ablation of BAT in rodents resulted in diet-induced obesity, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> In agreement with potentially beneficial effects of BAT or BAT-like activity for bone health, WAT browning was shown to be potentially anabolic for the skeleton through <italic>in vitro</italic> studies in osteoblasts and osteocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> and reduced BAT function in <italic>Misty</italic> mice was characterized by impaired bone formation and increased bone resorption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup></p><p>Irisin is a peptide hormone of 112 amino acids that was initially described as a myokine derived from fibronectin-type III domain-containing 5 (FNDC5) proteolytic cleavage, which induces WAT browning, UCP1-mediated thermogenesis, and energy expenditure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> Endurance exercise or muscle-specific overexpression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-&#x003b3; coactivator (PGC)-1&#x003b1;, a transcriptional coactivator of adaptive thermogenesis and mitochondrial biogenesis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> were shown to stimulate FNDC5 expression in skeletal muscle and increase circulating levels of irisin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> FNDC5/irisin was later described to be produced by WAT after exercise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> In addition to exercise, circulatory levels of irisin can be upregulated in response to cold exposure in healthy human subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> Detection of irisin has also been described in cardiac muscle,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> brain,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> and cerebrospinal fluid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> Different laboratories attempting to investigate the activation of PGC1&#x003b1;/FNDC5/irisin signaling by exercise in skeletal muscle or WAT have obtained results that are difficult to reconcile.

Furthermore, we have demonstrated that 2 weeks of voluntary wheel-running exercise in mice increased FNDC5/irisin expression at the mRNA and protein levels in exercised bones as compared with controls. The exercise protocol used in our study induced PGC1&#x003b1;/FNDC5/irisin signaling and expression of osteogenic markers in bone, and concurrently increased UCP1 mRNA expression in subcutaneous WAT and decreased average body weight. These results were in agreement with the notion of exercise-induced irisin production by bone contributed to WAT browning by releasing irisin to circulation and increasing osteogenesis by autocrine mechanisms. Our ELISA results demonstrated that levels of irisin in circulation did not significantly change following 7 days of exercise, but significantly decreased following 14 days of voluntary running. When APN knockout mice were subjected to the same exercise protocol as wild-type mice, serum irisin levels were increased following 14 days of exercise, being the only animal model investigated in our lab that exhibited a sustained enough increase to be detected by ELISA. It is likely that adiponectin and other adipokines upregulated with exercise may work synergistically or antagonistically with irisin to mediate exercise-induced effects in bone strengthening and WAT browning. Thus, it has been reported that adiponectin is increased after 12 weeks of exercise training in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> and bone tissues express adiponectin and its receptors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></sup> Most importantly, adiponectin has been shown to promote anabolic effects in bone,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> partly by decreasing the sympathetic tone. It is also known that browning of WAT and bone remodeling are regulated by the sympathetic nervous system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> and reduced BAT function in <italic>Misty</italic> mice leads to altered sympathetic nervous system activity and bone loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> In conclusion, the exercise-induced irisin production in bone may not be the only mechanism leading to increased osteogenesis and WAT browning, and some of those effects could be mediated by other adipokines regulated by exercise.</p><p>Several reports in the literature have suggested or demonstrated that irisin could have a role in bone formation or bone fracture prevention. First, irisin levels in circulation were described to be lower than normal in patients with T2D,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> which exhibit increased risk of osteoporosis and bone fractures,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> and in subjects who suffered from osteoporotic fractures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> Second, it was suggested that irisin secreted by exercised skeletal muscle could induce osteogenesis at the bone&#x02013;muscle interface. In that study, authors showed that conditioned media from primary cultures of myoblasts and myotubes isolated from exercised muscles increased osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> Recombinant irisin was also reported to mediate anabolic effects in bone when 2-month-old mice received weekly injections of 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for 4 weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> In our study, we found mice injected at an 89-fold lower daily dose and for 2 weeks exhibited a 3-fold increase of irisin levels in circulation, which correlated with increased osteoblast numbers and enhanced mRNA expression of osteogenic markers in bone without significant effects on osteoclast numbers. Furthermore, UCP1 mRNA in WAT was upregulated, suggesting that irisin promoted the browning response as well. In agreement with the ability of recombinant irisin to recapitulate some of the beneficial effects of exercise in the skeleton by directly signaling on osteoblasts, we found irisin increased MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic differentiation and bone mineralization <italic>in vitro.</italic> Irisin treatment <italic>in vivo</italic> was shown by other investigators to decrease Sost mRNA expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> and sclerostin-mediated bone response to mechanical unloading through antagonizing Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref></sup> In our study, we found recombinant irisin increased nuclear localization of &#x003b2;-catenin in MC3T3-E1 osteoblast precursor cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. It is, therefore, tempting to speculate that irisin activation of Wnt/b-catenin signaling could have derived from irisin inhibiting sclerostin, which would relieve the sclerostin-mediated suppression of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling, resulting in its activation. Because UCP1 mRNA was upregulated in WAT in our <italic>in vivo</italic> study, recombinant irisin could have mediated indirect effects on bone metabolism by promoting WAT browning, which was reported to be anabolic for the skeleton.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> Thus, it has been described that young women with cold-activated BAT have higher bone mineral density than those without BAT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> Furthermore, impaired BAT function in <italic>Misty</italic> mice has been correlated with increased sympathetic tone, impaired bone formation, and increased bone resorption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> Mechanistic studies have also shown that brite cells can induce osteogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> by releasing factors including insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2 and wingless-related mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) integration site 10 b that decrease sclerostin expression and increase RANKL expression by osteocytes. Because sclerostin is a negative regulator of bone formation that inhibits WNT signaling in osteoblasts,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref></sup> and RANKL enhances osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption, it is plausible that the indirect effects of irisin in bone metabolism through WAT browning could oppose some of the direct effects of irisin in bone cells in our <italic>in vivo</italic> study. Our &#x003bc;CT experiments demonstrated both trabecular and cortical thickness increased in the irisin-treated group respect to the saline-treated group. As overexpression of FNDC5 was previously described to induce the browning response,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> the increased cortical bone thickness observed in the FNDC5 lentiviral group could be partly resulting from the brown adipose tissue expansion response in addition to direct effects of cleaved irisin on bone cells. It is tempting to speculate that the bone phenotype resulting from FNDC5 lentiviral experiments mostly derived from the WAT browning response, although direct effects on osteoblast differentiation could not be discounted, as mRNA of osteogenic differentiation markers including osterix, bone sialoprotein, and ALP was increased in bones of the FNDC5 lentivirus group as compared with the control group. In a different <italic>in vivo</italic> study by other investigators, mice injected with an 89-fold higher daily dose of recombinant irisin for 4 weeks exhibited a significantly increased cortical bone mass and parameters of bone strength,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> decreased osteoclast numbers, and increased osteoblast numbers. The higher bone response of irisin in that study could be partly derived from a lack of induction of the browning response and/or higher irisin levels being induced in circulation than in our <italic>in vivo</italic> studies with either recombinant irisin or FNDC5 lentiviral experiments.</p><p>Different laboratories attempting to investigate the activation of PGC1&#x003b1;/FNDC5/irisin signaling by exercise in skeletal muscle or WAT have obtained results that are difficult to reconcile. Some of the inconsistencies have been attributed to differences in the exercise protocol, animal species, and mouse strains, or their choice of anti-FNDC5/irisin antibodies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19 bib20 bib21">19&#x02013;21</xref></sup> Induction of FNDC5/irisin expression by PGC1&#x003b1; and exercise was initially described after 3 weeks of free wheel-running exercise in 12-week-old B6 mice and 10 weeks of aerobic training in non-diabetic human subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> Other studies replicated the stimulatory effect of exercise on irisin secretion in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref></sup> and demonstrated that irisin secretion could be induced not only by exercise but also by cold exposure in healthy subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> Additional studies using rats have suggested that there could be a good relationship between the abundance of PGC1&#x003b1; and FNDC5, and the oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle.

When a similar study was performed with murine muscle, mRNA expression levels of PGC1&#x003b1; different transcripts (resulting from alternative splicing) were slightly increased, decreased, or did not change depending on the transcript evaluated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> In the same study, significant upregulation of PGC1&#x003b1; expression at the mRNA and protein level, was only detected after acute exercise and correlated with increased levels of irisin in skeletal muscle and serum. The same study could not detect any changes in FNDC5 protein expression after acute exercise or 3 weeks of voluntary wheel running in mouse skeletal muscle. In that study, irisin did not increase in serum or skeletal muscle after 3 weeks of voluntary exercise, but it did after a bout of acute exercise with a treadmill. In our mouse study, we found that mRNA levels were downregulated in a time-dependent manner in red muscle following 2 weeks of exercise. In addition, FNDC5 mRNA expression in WAT did not change significantly after exercise, and PGC1&#x003b1; mRNA was unchanged after exercise in skeletal muscle and WAT (data not shown). Another study was only able to find a transient increase of PGC1&#x003b1; in subcutaneous adipose tissue after a week of exercise training, but not after longer periods of exercise in rats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> The transient PGC1&#x003b1; expression pattern in WAT correlated with increased FNDC5/irisin secretion at 1 week of exercise, and a significant decrease of FNDC5/irisin secretion at 3 weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> Some of the inconsistencies reported by these publications and by our results can be attributed to differences in the animal protocol (different exercise program, animal species, or animal age), but also to the choice of anti-FNDC5/irisin antibodies.

Recombinant irisin induced osteoblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and inhibited osteoclast differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) in bone cells lines. Systemic administration of irisin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) or FNDC5 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) could potentially regulate bone metabolism <italic>in vivo</italic> by direct mechanisms on bone cells or indirectly because browning of WAT (mediated by irisin or FNDC5) is anabolic for the skeleton.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> Recombinant irisin has also been shown to suppress sclerostin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> which mediates bone response to mechanical unloading through inhibition of the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref></sup>

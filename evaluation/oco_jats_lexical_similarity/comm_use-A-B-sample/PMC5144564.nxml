restructuring phase and has also conquered a large number of legacies in the last two
months. We had the opportunity to notice the interest of the Associate Editors, Junior
Editor, Reviewers, Authors and Contributors, thus, helping our journal to have a future
of progressive steps, increasing the frequency and regularity of our publications.</p><sec><title>ASSOCIATE EDITORS</title><p>The BJCVS currently has 13 volunteer Associate Editors who are striving to fit the
requirements of the new submission system in addition to capturing articles in the
respective areas: Advances in Cardiovascular Surgery, Diseases of the Aorta, Basic
Research, Cardiovascular Surgery, Cardiovascular Rehabilitation, Continuous Medical
Education (CME), Congenital Diseases, Coronary Surgery, Transcatheter Aortic Valve
Implantation (TAVI) and Valvar Surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>SUBMISSION SYSTEM</title><p>The submission system has already received 50 manuscripts for evaluation. The
barriers are being broken, and with each obstacle the BJCVS team develops a
commendable advisory work so that all doubts are quickly cleared up.</p><p>We are involved in a rigorous process for meeting deadlines. Reviewers who do not
meet deadlines are replaced, resulting in the automatic generation of negative
punctuation on ScholarOne evaluation system. Likewise, Associate Editors are also
evaluated according to the fulfillment of deadlines and quality of opinions.</p><p>We are very excited about this systematics, because Authors who do not submit the
manuscript correction within the determined period, have the manuscripts
invalidated, and must submit it as a new manuscript, losing its position in
publication queue.</p></sec><sec><title>MANUSCRIPTS IN ENGLISH</title><p>Spelling and Grammar have strongly been questioned by the Reviewers and Associate
Editors, a reason of great concern for us; because English language is often so
unsatisfactory, and in some cases it prevents content analysis.</p><p>I request the Authors to collaborate with the BJCVS by sending us the manuscripts
reviewed by professionals who are able to translate them accurately, thus, they
won't be returned, there will be no delays or higher costs to be paid by the
authors. Our reviewers do not correct articles, they only check if the English
language is good enough to be published.</p><p>We would like to ask you to read the editorial written by Dr. Mariel
Marlow<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>, published in Clinics, which brings together the 10 most
common mistakes made by Brazilians when writing English manuscripts.</p></sec><sec><title>SOCIAL MEDIA</title><p>Under the guidance of the BJCVS team, the Junior Editor Dr. Gabriel Liguori took over
the social media two months ago and created a team composed of Residents in
Cardiovascular Surgery and Medical Academics, who update the Blog <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bjcvs.wordpress.com/">https://bjcvs.wordpress.com</ext-link> and the BJCVS Facebook page <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.facebook.com/bjcvs">https://www.facebook.com/bjcvs</ext-link>.</p><sec><title>Facebook</title><p>After posting the material, the number of likes in 2 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>) was increased by 33%, there was also an eight-fold
increase in the number of people interacting with us in the first month (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>)</p><p>

are national and two international in the original article, review article and
how-to article categories.</p><p>The following articles that have been chosen to be part of Continuing Medical
Education (CME) are also available, now under the responsibility of an Associate
Editor specific to this important area: "<italic>In-Vitro</italic> Evaluation of Two
Types of Neonatal Oxygenators in Handling Gaseous Microemboli and Maintaining
Optimal Hemodynamic Stability During Cardiopulmonary Bypass" (page 343);
"Intraoperative Analysis of Flow Dynamics in Arteriovenous Composite Y Grafts" (page
351); "Comparison of Early Outcomes with Three Approaches for Combined Coronary
Revascularization and Carotid Endarterectomy" (page 365) and "Reference Values for
the Six-Minute Walk Test in Healthy Children and Adolescents: a Systematic Review"
(page 381).</p><p>I emphasize that the CME is a valuable tool for learning and updating the knowledge,
besides being important for the test to obtain the Specialist Title of the
SBCCV.</p><p>As always, I deeply thank all the Directors of the SBCCV, Associate Editors, Peer
Reviewers, all the dedicated staff that help me a lot, and, finally, but not less
important, I also thank the Authors who give prestige to our Journal sending the
manuscripts to be considered for publication.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Domingo M.

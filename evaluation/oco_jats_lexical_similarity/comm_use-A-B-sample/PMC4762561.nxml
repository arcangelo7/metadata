in the past decades. In information and communication technology, innovations have
become smaller in size, more efficient and often more affordable. The Internet and
the development of digital technology (computerbased technology) in particular have
made the most significant impact in the field of information and communication
technology. The Internet is essentially a network of computers across the world
which is linked through global telecommunications. Although it was originally only
used by defense personnel in the United States, easy access to computers and related
technology have made using the Internet a common activity in more recent
times<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The World Wide Web (www) is a collection of interconnected documents, which are
accessible using the Internet. It enables people from almost anywhere in the world
to access information on almost any topic from shopping to weather forecasts; and
from research to downloading music and movies. In addition to the Internet, global
media networks (corporations which include television and media companies with
branches in multiple countries) also bring news and information about current events
to people all over the globe. It is now possible for someone in Australia to pick up
a copy of an American fashion magazine, or for someone in the United States or in
Brazil. Therefore, the growing influence of the Internet has been reflected in the
appearance of software products specifically for translating Web pages aiming to
break language barriers<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p><sec><title>Machine translation: a brief history</title><p>Computer programs (software) for translation of natural languages, commonly and
traditionally called "machine translation" (MT) or, in non-English speaking
countries, "automatic translation" (traduction automatique, automaticheskij
perevod) were initially developed for translations of scientific and technical
documents (its beginnings in the 1940s). Since the mid-1990s, the Internet has
exerted a powerful influence on MT development. First, there has been the
appearance of MT software products for translating specifically Web pages and
electronic messages offline led by Japanese companies. Afterwards, many
Internet-based online translation services were provided for this on-demand
translation such as Alta Vista site, Reverso systems, LogoMedia and Pars. Some
services offered post-editing human translators (revisers), at extra cost
accessed through "MT portals", that is, independent services offering a range of
translation systems from one or more system companies; most of them free of
charge. Basically in Science and Technology, the demand for translation has
almost exceeded the capacity of the translator professional, as a consequence,
for this growing need, the Internet has had a growing influence reflected in the
appearance MT software products for translating languages<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>It is now clear that different types of MT systems are required to meet widely
differing translation needs. Those identified so far include the traditional MT
systems for large organizations, usually within a restricted domain; the
translation tools and workstations designed for professional translators. The
advent of the cheap personal computer systems for occasional translations; the
use of systems to obtain messages for the purposes of surveillance or
information gathering; the use of MT for translating electronic messages
(electronic mail and Web pages, in particular); systems for monolinguals to
translate standard messages into unknown languages; systems for speech
translation in restricted domains were included into these systems<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>It is equally clear that as MT systems of many varieties become more widely known
and have been using the range of possible translation needs and possible types
of MT systems. These will also become wider and stimulate further research and
development, quite probably in directions not yet envisioned<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>To sum up, the related development of computer-based translation tools was
primarily the use of dictionaries and glossaries to translate technical texts,
and later, the translation databases and translator workstation such as the
Google Translate (GT), Bing Translate, Yahoo, Babel Fish e Systran were
developed influenced by the Internet.</p></sec><sec><title>Google Translate</title><p>Like most online translation tools, GT works on something called Statistical
Machine Translation which basically gathers loads of data over time to
statistically offer the best combination of translation in any given language
pair.</p><p>GT is one of the most used machine translation tools online. It is a free virtual
service at no-cost. GT offers its services subsidiary of Google Inc. Alphabet
instant translation of texts, websites, speech, images, or real-time video from
one language into another; translations are instantaneous and for immediate use.
It offers a web interface, mobile interfaces for Android and iOS, and an API
that developers can use to build browser extensions, applications and other
software. Since September 2015, GT supports 90 languages at various levels and
serves over 200 million people daily. The company introduced its own translation
software in 2007 (7<sup>th</sup> October), as before used by SYSTRAN translator,
used by other translation services such as Babel Fish (Altavista), the
translator of AOL, Yahoo and MSN<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Recently, GT has increasingly implemented improvements to its mechanism, thus
making it one of the leading services in idiomatic translation. The team at
Google is working to expand available languages and capabilities in computing
power for translating conversations. The company began rolling out a new version
of a free GT application that, in part lets people point Android or Apple
smartphones at signs, menus, recipes or other material written in French,
German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, or Spanish and see them in English.</p><p>One can instantly translate text using a camera, so it is an easier way to
navigate street signs in the Italian countryside, for example, or decide what to
order off a Barcelona menu. This feature was built on Word Lens technology that
Google acquired last year when it bought Quest Visual, that is, Word Lens which
use video mode in smartphone cameras to scan scenes, identify writing and then
display it as if it were written in English<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>We aimed to present an overview on devices for translating languages provided
mainly by the Web which have been strengthening communication among peoples in a
virtual globalized world. Moreover to point out their usefulness on the
applicability particularly on Medicine and Health Sciences regarding both skills
of communication: spoken and written.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>This research was carried out by means of a bibliographical survey to access the
development of technological translating devices offered by the WEB service since
their creation up to nowadays. An issue was addressed to readers for reflecting
about the usefulness on the applicability of these tools in Medicine and Health
Sciences. Online Translators and GT were the main important terms surveyed to reach
related contents for the goal of this report.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>At first, taking into account communication as the cornerstone of Medicine even
between doctors and their patients or the growing of information and knowledge into
the field of Health Sciences mainly written in English; translators online such as
GT can be considered useful tool when language is a barrier in communication; that
is, GT presents a possible solution to this problem. As an extension of their
widespread integration of speech-to-text throughout the android platform, Google
created a language app centered around a straightforward concept; enter one
language, output in another.</p><p>This device still remains the most easily available and free initial mode of
communication in general. The increased availability and use of the Internet have
facilitated online communication between physicians and patients when the patient is
not physically present at the physician's place of practice. Communication by using
translators may be directly related to the provision of patient care or may be used
for transmitting more general information for administrative, educational or health
promotional purposes. These were primarily concerned with the two most common
vehicles of online communications: email and physician websites<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In the evaluation of the accuracy and usefulness of GT in translating ten commonly
English medical statements used in communications between patients and doctors;
Davies<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> has claimed
limited usefulness for these medical phrases (57.7% accuracy). The author's
recommendation is that it should not be trusted for important medical communication
based on this assessment.</p><p>In another study, GT was tested as an alternative for professional interpreters' (PI)
work since this was not available at that time. The translation of 20 standardized
sentences from a neonatal doctor-/nurse-relative interview from German to English,
Portuguese and Arabic, using GT was not effective to overcome language barriers in
neonatal medicine. The assessment on translation by GT showed an average of 42% of
the sentences was correctly translated concerning grammar and content. The
proportion of incorrectly translated sentences varied between 45-70%. By
simplification, another 23% were translated correctly.</p><p>Translations by GT were often incorrect in content and grammar. The supposition was
that the design of GT, which is a statistical translation engine, might be an
explanation for this phenomenon. Presently, GT cannot guarantee unambiguous
translations and cannot substitute PIs; only in particular circumstances, the use of
GT or similar engines may be justified. The recommendation proposed was for future
use of electronic translation services to compile a catalogue of these standardized
sentences containing central information, and afterwards they should be translated
into defined foreign languages without misinterpretation or loss of
information<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>On top of updating reports, GT team is continuously working to improve the quality of
the translations themselves and to add new languages. A year ago GT Community was
launched, that is, a place for multilingual people from anywhere in the world to
provide and correct translations. The millions of language lovers who have already
pitched in more than 100 million words so far have been updating its translations
for over 90 language pairs, and plan to update many more as the community
grows<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Computing power for translating conversations comes from Google servers, so
connections to the Internet through WiFi or telecom carriers are needed. The team at
Google is working to expand available languages and capabilities, thus they still
have lots of work to do: more than half of the content on the Internet is in
English, but only around 20% of the world's population speaks English. Today's
updates knock down a few more language barriers, helping people to communicate
better and get the information they need.</p><p>This latest innovation of GT could also help immigrants and refugees with limited
language proficiency when they are settled in a new society, with new language and
new culture. The consequences of language barriers affect the ability of these new
residents to live successfully in the country where language is a pathway to their
integration<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>To reach that level of accuracy, intelligent machines have to not just convert each
word into a new language, but analyze entire phrases for context and infer their
meaning before offering up a translation the way a human interpreter does. If a
product can offer accurate real-time language translation with an augmented device
that someone would actually want to use, that'll be a seriously world-changing
thing. Forget love, technology is shaping up to be the universal language.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSION AND FINAL CONSIDERATIONS</title><p>GT shows a lot of promise, and hopefully it can be useful either for the tourists or
the physicians who want to eliminate some gaps of language misunderstanding as in
spoken or written communication. In the clinical setting where spoken language is
used between physician and patient, GT has an extension of widespread integration of
speech-to-text throughout the android platform: Android OS. However, both the
physician and the patient would be better served by a medical dictionary or a
professional translator, if available. Google has big plans for real-time
translation, and they expect it to vastly improve in the next few years. As it
stands, however, the medical professional cannot afford to compromise the patient
care by early-adoption of this technology.</p><p>Online translators have already taken a big step in their codes, but are still far
from what would be ideal. The main reasons are: not everything is translated with
the service, thus, a comprehensive translation of the text will not be provided. Not
every language is offered. It does not give natural, fluently readable translations;
GT gives a mechanical and direct translation of words. Context is not part of the
equation: GT will not know the context of the content. For example, who is the
audience, what are their ages, education level and cultural sensitivities? In
addition, what is the content being used for? Eg. for a speech, marketing copy,
website, white paper, instructional content or something else?</p><p>It increasingly becomes a tool for professional translators who improve the text and
take questions through the services. In addition, machine translation is recommended
for quick translations, on websites and, in general texts. Considering the rigidity
of scientific written language, one should take into mind the words into their
context in such model of communication. The recommendation is to be aware of the
multiple meaning a word can present (POLYSEMY). In his book "Linguagem
M&#x000e9;dica", Dr Joffre M de Rezende (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jmrezende.com.br/">http://www.jmrezende.com.br/</ext-link>) pointed out the traps the translator
could fall if he does not consider this characteristic of the language. To consult a
standard-bilingual specialized dictionary for searching entries and their
definition-translations could be the first solution for any doubt on mistranslation
considering hazard statements in Medicine.</p><p>Take a look at OneLook Dictionary Search (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.onelook.com">http://www.onelook.com</ext-link>), an
online dictionary (monolingual or bilingual). If you need to type a word, phrase or
acronym and the site does a search in more than a thousand dictionaries. It is
called the Google of dictionaries. Among them, the best known are as Macmillan
Dictionary, Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary, Collins Dictionary, Cambridge
Advanced Learner's Dictionary, American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language,
Compact Oxford English Dictionary, etc. Results are grouped by category. For
example, if you type stem cell, you see a list of generic dictionary and then the
medicals. If you enter interest rate, again we have the generic followed by the
economy. Then you choose which construction or consulting. It follows some online
addresses for Consulting.</p><p>TheFreeDictionary.com (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pt.thefreedictionary.com/">http://pt.thefreedictionary.com/</ext-link>) allows you to create your own
personal homepage by adding and removing, dragging and dropping, and "using or
losing" existing content windows. In addition, you can add your own bookmarks,
weather information, horoscope, and RSS feeds (Really Simple Syndication or Rich
Site Summary) from anywhere on the web.</p><p>The Visuwords online graphical dictionary and thesaurus (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.visuwords.com/">http://www.visuwords.com/</ext-link>) is indicated to look up words to find
their meanings and associations with other words and concepts. To produce diagrams
reminiscent of a neural net. To earn how words associate. To enter words into the
search box to look them up or double-click a node to expand the tree. Click and drag
the background to pan around and use the mouse wheel to zoom. Hover over nodes to
see the definition and click and drag individual nodes to move them around to help
clarify connections.</p><p>Visuwords uses Princeton University's WordNet, an open source database built by
University students and language researchers combined with a visualization tool and
user interface built from a combination of modern web technologies.</p><p>All these online devices are available as a free resource to all people's demand in
the Web.</p><p>The second solution is also given by the democratic Web: the Linguee (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.linguee.com/">http://www.linguee.com/</ext-link>) is a unique translation tool combining an
editorial dictionary and a search engine with which one can search billions of
bilingual texts for words and expressions. Compared to traditional online
dictionaries, Linguee contains about 1,000 times more translated texts, which are
displayed in full sentences. Linguee shows translations for expressions such as
"strong evidence, strong relationship or strong opinion", and even for rare
expressions or specific technical terms.</p><p>The Linguee search results are divided into several sections. In the top section you
are shown results from the reliable editorial dictionary. Professional editors have
been working continuously on adding new entries and enhancing the quality of the
dictionary. This provides a quick overview of various translations of your search
term. Below you are shown example sentences from other sources to give you an idea
of how your search term has been translated in context.</p><p>But the question still remains: to give trust? In terms. There is still no complete
good to replace human translation; based on knowledge, and a good deal of effort and
a lot of interest in keeping an eye on the evolution of these online devices are
recommended.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1">

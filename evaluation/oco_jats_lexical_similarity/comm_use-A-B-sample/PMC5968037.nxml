Inhibition of Wnt signaling has shown efficacy in various pre-clinical models of these disorders. One of the key challenges in developing targeted anti-cancer drugs is to balance efficacy with on-target toxicity. Given the crucial role Wnts play in the differentiation of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, acute inhibition of Wnt signaling is likely to affect bone homeostasis. In this study, we evaluated the skeletal effect of small molecule inhibitor of an o-acyl transferase porcupine (PORCN) that prevents Wnt signaling by blocking the secretion of all Wnts. Micro-computed tomography and histomorphometric evaluation revealed that the bones of mice treated with two structurally distinct PORCN inhibitors LGK974 and ETC-1922159 (ETC-159) had loss-of-bone volume and density within 4 weeks of exposure. This decreased bone mass was associated with a significant increase in adipocytes within the bone marrow. Notably, simultaneous administration of a clinically approved anti-resorptive, alendronate, a member of the bisphosphonate family, mitigated loss-of-bone mass seen upon ETC-159 treatment by regulating activity of osteoclasts and blocking accumulation of bone marrow adipocytes. Our results support the addition of bone protective agents when treating patients with PORCN inhibitors. Mitigation of bone toxicity can extend the therapeutic utility of Wnt pathway inhibitors.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="LongSummary"><title>Bone loss: Drug combination reduces toxicity of cancer treatment</title><p id="Par2">Potential bone loss caused by cancer drugs could be mitigated by administering an existing osteoporosis drug. Over-activation of the Wnt signaling pathway, which helps maintain healthy tissues and bone development, is often found in cancer. Scientists are trialing cancer drugs that block a key enzyme&#x000a0;PORCN and therefore inhibit Wnt signaling, but these drugs may also adversely affect patients&#x02019; bone structure. David Virshup at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore and Bart Williams at the Van Andel Research Institute in Michigan, US, and co-workers found that mice treated with&#x000a0;PORCN -inhibiting cancer drugs lost bone volume and density within four weeks of exposure. The team then combined the cancer drug with another drug, alendronate, which is already used to treat osteoporosis. This combination targeted aberrant Wnt signaling and limited bone toxicity in the mice.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Wnt signaling plays key roles in many aspects of development and adult tissue homeostasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> WNTs are secreted palmitoleated glycoprotein ligands that bind to cell surface receptors to initiate signaling in diverse tissues and cell types. Downstream signaling commonly leads to stabilization of &#x003b2;-catenin and activation of cell-type specific transcriptional activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> Mutations that aberrantly activate the Wnt pathway are among the most common events associated with human cancers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> Pathological activation of Wnt signaling is also critical in the progression of various fibrotic disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> Targeted therapies to inhibit the Wnt pathway are being developed and have shown efficacy in various pre-clinical models of Wnt addicted cancers and in fibrosis (reviewed in ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>). For example, the secretion of all Wnts can be blocked by inhibition of PORCN. PORCN is an endoplasmic reticulum resident O-acyl transferase that catalyzes the palmitoleation of all Wnts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> Pre-clinical studies of PORCN inhibitors have demonstrated robust activity against several tumor types. Orally available drugs that inhibit PORCN have been developed and have progressed to human clinical trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> However, concerns regarding mechanism-based toxicity of Wnt pathway inhibitors could impact the clinical utility of these agents.</p><p id="Par4">Multiple studies have demonstrated an important role for Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling in bone formation, maintenance, and accrual during different stages of the life (reviewed in refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>). Early in development, Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling is required for the differentiation of mesenchymal precursor cells to osteoblasts. Conditional genetic ablation of &#x003b2;-catenin or simultaneous deletion of Wnt co-receptors <italic>Lrp5</italic> and <italic>Lrp6</italic> in the mesenchymal progenitors or osteoblast-committed precursors blocks their differentiation and maturation to osteoblasts, leading to their absence in membranous bones.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> In the absence of &#x003b2;-catenin these osteochondro-progenitors differentiate into chondrocytes. Conversely, ectopic activation of stabilized &#x003b2;-catenin leads to enhanced ossification and suppression of chondrocyte formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> In addition to differentiation, Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling also coordinates bone acquisition by regulating the activity of both osteoclasts and osteoblasts. In vitro, osteoblasts lacking &#x003b2;-catenin exhibit impaired maturation and mineralization with elevated expression of osteoclast differentiation factor ligand (RANKL), and diminished expression of the RANKL decoy receptor, osteoprotegerin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> Thus, inactivation of &#x003b2;-catenin in mature osteoblasts promotes osteoclast differentiation hence enhanced bone resorption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> Conditional loss-of-Wntless, a chaperone required for secretion of Wnts from osteoblasts also severely impairs bone formation and inhibits the accrual of bone mass within the first 3 weeks after birth. There is dramatic reduction of the cortical and trabecular bone mass in these mice emphasizing the crucial role of osteoblast secreted Wnt ligands in bone mass accrual.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup></p><p id="Par5">Compared to the osteoblasts, osteocytes are long-lived and constitute 90% of the bone cells. Ectopic activation of canonical Wnt signaling by expressing dominant active &#x003b2;-catenin in the osteocytes results in an increase in the trabecular bone volume and bone mineral density of both the axial and appendicular skeleton.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> Conversely, loss-of-&#x003b2;-catenin in the mature osteoblasts and/or osteocytes causes severe osteopenia associated with increased osteoclastogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> These findings demonstrate that in adults Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling promotes the ability of differentiated osteoblasts to inhibit osteoclast differentiation.</p><p id="Par6">In this study, we analyzed the effect of PORCN inhibitors that block all Wnt secretion on bone structure and homeostasis in mice.

However, treatment with alendronate alone or concurrently with ETC-159 significantly decreased BS/BV, indicating complex trabecular structures reverted to more simple spherical structures (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). This alendronate-driven decrease in structural complexity was coupled with increased trabecular number and diameter, and was not affected by PORCN inhibition (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c&#x02013;e</xref>). Consistent with the increase in trabecular diameter and number, trabecular separation significantly decreased in all mice receiving alendronate, regardless if they were also exposed to ETC-159 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Effects of ETC-159 and alendronate on static bone histomorphometry. <bold>a</bold> Brightfield images of trichrome stained femoral sections from the indicated groups.

The osteoid volume decreased from 6.5% to 2.98% in ETC-159 treated mice and to 0.64% in alendronate-treated mice. This dropped to 0.43% in dually treated mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). There was a similar pattern of change in the osteoid surface in the ETC-159 and alendronate-treated mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). Although, ETC-159 to a lesser extent, and alendronate to a greater extent resulted in reduction of osteoid volume and surface, the change in osteoid width between the treatment groups was not significant (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>). Decrease in the osteoid volume and osteoid surface upon PORCN inhibition and alendronate treatment could be attributed to reduction in the number of osteoblasts that are responsible for secretion of the bone matrix (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>).</p><p id="Par15">One notable change in overall bone makeup was a significant increase in adipocytes when mice were treated with ETC-159. The number of adipocytes increased from 73.6 per mm<sup>2</sup>&#x02009; in vehicle-treated mice to 205 per mm<sup>2</sup> in ETC-159-treated mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5g</xref>). However, the addition of alendronate to ETC-159 reverted the adipocyte phenotype back to normal. The observed effect of increased adipogenesis on inhibition of Wnt signaling is consistent with the role of Wnt signaling in regulating the balance between adipocytes and osteoblasts during mesenchymal stem cell differentiation (reviewed in ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Response of osteoclasts to alendronate and ETC-159 treatment</title><p id="Par16">Due to the substantial loss-of-bone in mice treated with PORCN inhibitors, we analyzed the osteoclasts by TRAP staining (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a&#x02013;c</xref>). Treatment with ETC-159 alone did not have a significant effect on the number or size of osteoclasts. Alendronate led to significant changes in osteoclast numbers and surface, irrespective of the co-administration of ETC-159. The number of osteoclasts increased from an average of 5.83 per sample in vehicle-treated mice to 42.0 in mice treated with alendronate alone, and remained at 44.7 in dual-treated mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). Similarly, osteoclast surface also increased from 0.145&#x02009;mm in vehicle-treated mice to 1.4&#x02009;mm in alendronate-treated mice and 1.45&#x02009;mm in dually treated mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>). ETC-159 alone did not have a significant effect on osteoclast surface (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>).

Finally, we also assessed if systemic Wnt inhibition altered serum biomarkers of osteoclast and osteoblast activity. PORCN inhibition led to a significant decrease in serum concentration of the Wnt inhibitor sclerostin, with a trend to a stronger suppression with qod dosing (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>). This may reflect a response to decreasing local and global Wnt signaling. This decrease in sclerostin was not reversed by concurrent alendronate administration. A small increase in DKK1 concentration, also a negative regulator of Wnt signaling, was observed with qod dosing of ETC-159, which was enhanced with concurrent treatment with alendronate (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>). However, the concentration of osteoblastogenesis markers, osteoprotegerin (OPG) and osteocalcin had non-significant changes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7d, e</xref>).

This has led to an intense focus on developing agents that inhibit this pathway as candidate therapeutics for cancer treatment. One approach has been to target the activity of PORCN, an enzyme that catalyzes the addition of a palmitoleic acid to a conserved serine residue in all mammalian Wnts. This lipidation is required both for proper secretion of Wnts, as well as their binding to Frizzled family members to activate downstream signaling cascades.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> Several different PORCN inhibitors have been developed and show promising results in pre-clinical studies.

One example is vantictumab (OMP18R5), which binds to Frizzled 1, 2, 5, 7, and 8 and blocks the ability of Wnt ligand to activate signaling via these receptors. The Phase I clinical trials of vantictumab were temporarily halted due to &#x0201c;on-target&#x0201d; bone adverse events. The potentially deleterious effects of therapies targeting Wnt signaling on the skeleton was not unexpected, given the role of Wnt signaling in regulating homeostasis of the skeleton.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> For example, loss-of-function mutations in the Wnt co-receptor LRP5 result in osteoporosis pseudoglioma syndrome that is associated with extremely low bone mass at an early age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> Conversely, point mutations in LRP5 that prevent its inhibition by extracellular negative regulators of the pathway, such as DKK1 are associated with high-bone mass.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> Similarly, loss or severe reductions in the expression of sclerostin, an extracellular inhibitor of Wnt signaling increases bone mass.

It is important to note that previous studies have found that alendronate can inhibit adipogenesis and stimulate osteoblastogenesis in several in vitro studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> In addition, future work will explore whether other bisphosphonates or other agents that interfere with osteoclast activation such as Denosumab will also be beneficial in the context of PORCN inhibition.</p><p id="Par22">In summary, we demonstrate here that PORCN inhibition results in acute loss-of-bone that can be mitigated by the co-administration of alendronate.

Cardiovascular Surgery (BJCVS)<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> in which the authors presented their views about the
impact factor provided by the Journal Citation Report (JCR). However, I believe that the
readers of this journal should be aware that BJCVS is also indexed by another global
citation database, Scopus. As JCR generates a list of journals indexed by Web of
Science, SCImago generates annually a list of journals indexed by Scopus, which are
sorted by their SCImago journal rank (SJR) for each of its subject categories. Hence,
according to data from SCImago, BJCVS is categorized as Q3 in three subject categories:
&#x0201c;Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Medicine (miscellaneous)&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;Surgery&#x0201d;.</p><p>As the journal has been indexed by Web of Science since 2016, I extracted data published
by BJCVS from Scopus for the same time period to establish other journal&#x02019;s
attributes.</p><p>First, I searched for the documents published by other journals that cite articles
published by BJCVS. I sorted the citing journals by the total number of BJCVS articles
cited and determined to which quartile each of the journals belonged, according to their
SJR2017. As <xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows, half of the citing
journals belong to the first quartile, fact that corroborates the quality of the
research being published by BJCVS.</p><table-wrap id="t1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Ranking of the top-10 journals citing articles published by BJCVS, based on the

by Brazilian researchers from Brazil, followed at a distance by researchers from Turkey,
China, United States of America, and India. However, a closer look at the country of
affiliation of those researchers that use the information published by BJCVS reveals
that 480 articles were written by Brazilian researchers, 341 were authored by
researchers from United States of America, 191 were written by Chinese researchers, 89
were authored by British researchers, and 80 were written by German researchers. This
information is relevant to readers as it confirms the international visibility of the
work being published by BJCVS.</p><p>Currently, many members of the research community are considering the use of new metrics
to evaluate journals where to submit their manuscripts, following the guidelines set at
the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment, also known as
DORA<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.
Perhaps it is time to begin using metrics that are more meaningful to the
researchers.</p></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Evora</surname><given-names>PRB</given-names></name><name><surname>do Carmo</surname><given-names>ACF</given-names></name><name><surname>Goncalves</surname><given-names>CSA</given-names></name><name><surname>Braile</surname><given-names>DM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Considerations about the bibliometric impact factor.

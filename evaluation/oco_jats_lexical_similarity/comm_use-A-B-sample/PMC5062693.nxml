Arterial switch is the gold standard operation for this complex heart
disease. Arterial switch operation in the presence of intramural coronary
artery is surgically the most demanding even for the most experienced hands.
We are presenting our experience with a modified technique for intramural
coronary arteries in arterial switch operation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This prospective study involves 450 patients undergoing arterial switch
operation at our institute from April 2006 to December 2013 (7.6 years).
Eighteen patients underwent arterial switch operation with intramural
coronary artery. The coronary patterns and technique used are detailed in
the text.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The overall mortality found in the subgroup of 18 patients having intramural
coronary artery was 16% (n=3). Our first patient had an accidental injury to
the left coronary artery and died in the operating room. A seven-day old
newborn died from intractable ventricular arrhythmia fifteen hours after
surgery. Another patient who had multiple ventricular septal defects with
type B arch interruption died from residual apical ventricular septal defect
and sepsis on the eleventh postoperative day. The remainder of the patients
are doing well, showing a median follow-up duration of 1235.34&#x000b1;815.26
days (range 369 - 2730).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Transposition of the great arteries with intramural coronary artery is
demanding in a subset of patients undergoing arterial switch operation. We
believe our technique of coronary button dissection in the presence of
intramural coronary arteries using coronary shunt is simple and can be a
good addition to the surgeons' armamentarium.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Heart Defects, Congenital, Surgery</kwd><kwd>Transposition of Great Vessels</kwd><kwd>Coronary Artery Disease</kwd><kwd>Ventricular Function</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><table-wrap id="t4" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" style="background-color:#e6e7e8"><colgroup span="1"><col width="10%" span="1"/><col width="90%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr style="border-bottom-style:solid;border-top:solid; border-bottom-width:medium"><th colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1">

the aorta arises entirely or largely from the right ventricle and the pulmonary
trunk arises entirely or largely from the left ventricle, also known as discordant
ventriculoarterial connection<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. It is the most frequent cyanotic heart disease
diagnosed in newborns and it accounts for 5% to 7% of all congenital heart defects
(CHDs), with a prevalence rate of 0.2 per 1000 live births. Arterial switch
operation (ASO) is the operation of choice for TGA.</p><p>The term "intramural coronary artery" refers to the coronary patterns in which there
is an intimate relationship between aortic and coronary arterial walls;
histologically, the aortic and coronary medial walls are attached without interposed
adventitia<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Intramural coronary arteries are rare in patients with
normal ventriculoarterial connections, but they are proportionally more common in
TGA, with a reported incidence of 3% to 5%. The intramural artery usually originates
from the wrong sinus and runs between the great arteries. Sometimes the intramural
artery originates from its normal sinus, but above the sinotubular junction. These
abnormal coronary patterns might complicate coronary transfer during
ASO<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. We
present our modified surgical technique with a prospective analysis of the data.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>This prospective study was conducted at U. N. Mehta Institute of Cardiology and
Research Centre for 7.6 years. After receiving approval from the institutional
ethics committee, a total of 450 patients who underwent ASO from April 2006 to
December 2013 were included in the study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table
1</xref>). All of the patients were diagnosed with two-dimensional
echocardiography. Two hundred and seventy six patients had TGA with intact
ventricular septum (IVS), 141 patients had TGA with ventricular septal defect (VSD)
(six of them had multiple VSD), and 33 patients had Taussig-Bing anomaly (one had
multiple VSD). Three patients in the TGA/ VSD group and two with Taussig-Bing
anomaly had type-B arch interruption. Eighteen patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>) had intramural coronary artery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>), eleven of which were from the TGA/VSD group and seven
from the TGA/IVS group (one was on prostaglandin infusion and two underwent balloon
atrial septostomy on the 4<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> day of life). None of the
patients from the Taussig-Bing anomaly group had intramural coronary artery.
Similarly, none of the eighteen patients had preoperative diagnosis/suspicion of
intramural coronary pattern. Eight patients with intramural coronary arteries had
both left and right coronary arteries having intramural course arising from a single
ostium from Sinus 2 (one of them had a separate opening with kissing edges). The
patients with intramural course were operated on by a single surgeon. The technique
of separation of coronaries into two buttons was used in all eighteen patients.</p><table-wrap id="t1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Details of the patients who underwent arterial switch operations.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="all"><colgroup span="1"><col width="75%" span="1"/><col width="25%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr style="border-top-style:solid; border-top-width:medium"><th colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1">Total: 450 patients</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr style="border-top-style:solid; border-top-width:medium"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Diagnosis</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of Patients (%)</td></tr><tr style="border-top-style:solid; border-top-width:medium"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Transposition of the Great Arteries with Intact Ventricular

(aortic and single right atrial cannulation for TGA with IVS and bicaval
cannulation for the TGA/VSD group; multiple dose ST Thomas cardioplegia was used
in the first nine patients and Del nido cardioplegia in the other nine). The
aorta was transected at the level of the pulmonary artery bifurcation and it was
inspected from above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2B</xref>) in both sinuses for the presence of a
separate origin of coronary arteries. Whenever the opening of the left coronary
artery was not identified in Sinus 1, Sinus 2 was inspected for the opening of
both coronaries. Usually, in cases of intramural coronary artery, the left
coronary artery originates from Sinus 2 at the upper right side of the posterior
commissure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). In eight patients,
we found that both left and right coronary arteries had an intramural course,
arising from Sinus 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>) with a
single opening; one patient had separate openings with kissing edges. The length
of the intramural course of the right coronary was nearly 2-3 mm in all cases
whereas the length of the intramural course of the left coronary was 4-6 mm
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>). We used coronary shunts
(Synovis Life Technologies, Inc., St. Paul, MN, USA) to probe the coronary
artery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>) and to find its
intramural course in the aortic wall. The posterior commissure was turned down
and the stay stitch was placed with a 7-0/8-0 polypropylene suture at the
opening of the intramural coronary artery, keeping the coronary shunt in situ
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>). The entire roof of the
intramural coronary arteries was excised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure
2F</xref>) until the internal opening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure
2F</xref>) was identified. The bulbous end of the coronary shunt not only
helped to identify the internal opening but also prevented any accidental injury
to the coronary ostia. A similar procedure was done for the other (right)
coronary artery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2E</xref>). Following
unroofing, the aortic openings of the coronary ostia were identified in their
respective sinuses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2F</xref>). The
coronary buttons were excised in routine fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2G</xref>) and the proximal epicardial coronary artery was dissected
for 2-3 mm to avoid any kink during relocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2G</xref>). The margins of the coronary buttons were not smooth
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2H</xref>) because of the tissue of
the posterior commissure. In addition, the buttons of the left coronary were
small, but could be comfortably relocated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure
2I</xref>) to the neo aorta. The left coronary artery was relocated using
the punch hole technique in all patients. The right coronary artery was
relocated using the trapdoor technique in sixteen patients while the punch hole
technique was used for the remaining two patients. The posterior commissure was
resuspended after proximal neo pulmonary artery reconstruction. A Lecompte
maneuver was performed in all patients with intramural coronary artery. The
redundant portion of the proximal neo aorta was plicated posteriorly to form a
keel, if required, especially in patients in the TGA/VSD group. The neo aortic
and neo pulmonary anastomosis were performed in routine fashion. All patients
were weaned off bypass with a moderate dose of inotropes (Adrenaline 0.05
micrograms/kg/ minute and Milrinone 0.5 micrograms/kg/minute) without any
difficulty. Mean bypass time was 148 minutes and mean cross-clamp time was 106
minutes in the TGA/IVS group. Mean bypass time was 166 minutes and mean
cross-clamp time was 130 minutes in the TGA/VSD group. The chest was left open
in eleven patients during the first operative day due to diffused bleeding and
it was closed the next day. Postprocedure patients had stable hemodynamic course
without any electrocardiogram (ECG) features of myocardial ischaemia.</p><p><fig id="f2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Anatomical patterns of the coronary arteries.</p></caption><p>A- External appearance of the intramural coronary artery.</p><p>B- Single ostial opening in sinus 2.</p><p>C- Coronary shunt showing the direction of the left intramural coronary

dissection, though a 5 mm Gortex (W. L. Gore and Associates, Flagstaff, AZ) graft
was used from the innominate artery to the single coronary button for coronary blood
supply in a desperate attempt to save him, he died in the operating room secondary
to bleeding and severe ventricular dysfunction. One seven-day-old newborn, who
underwent TGA with IVS on Prostaglandin infusion and no intraoperative problems, had
moderate left ventricular dysfunction on 2D echocardiography six hours after
surgery, despite showing stable hemodynamic parameters without any ECG features of
myocardial ischaemia. He died from intractable ventricular arrhythmia fifteen hours
after surgery. Another patient who had multiple VSD with type-B arch interruption
died from residual apical VSD and sepsis on the eleventh postoperative day. The rest
of the patients did well in the immediate postoperative period. On every visit, the
patients underwent ECG and 2D Doppler echocardiography. One patient had mild
valvular pulmonary stenosis with a peak gradient of 20 mmHg and all other patients
had patent coronary arteries without any evidence of regional wall motion
abnormality, with good biventricular function and no valvular or supra valvular
aortic/pulmonary stenosis or regurgitation. So far, none of our patients has
undergone myocardial perfusion scan/angiography or any other intervention.</p><sec><title>Survival analysis</title><p>The mean follow-up duration was 1235.34&#x000b1;815.26, whereas median was 1788.5

The ASO
is the treatment of choice for patients with TGA. The term "intramural coronary
artery" refers to the coronary patterns in which there is an intimate relationship
between the aortic and coronary arterial walls; histologically, the aortic and
coronary medial walls are attached without interposed adventitia<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. The incidence of intramural
coronary artery varies from 1.4% to 5% in various series<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. Successful relocation of the coronary arteries is the
most important step in ASO. Almost all kinds of coronary patterns can be relocated,
however, the presence of an intramural coronary artery offers several surgical
challenges and carries high mortality and morbidity<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. A meta-analysis by Pasquali et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> reported that the presence
of an intramural coronary artery is associated with the highest mortality compared
to any other coronary artery pattern, with more than a six-fold increase in
mortality compared to the usual coronary arrangement.</p><p>Diagnosis of intramural coronary artery in TGA using two-dimensional echocardiography
is explained by Pasquini et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. In our experience, intramural coronary artery is
always seen as an intraoperative surprise after aortic transection. However, the
absence of conical projection of the coronary artery should always raise suspicion
in the surgeon's mind. Furthermore, if there is no left coronary artery ostium in
sinus one after aortotomy, the surgeon should strongly suspect there is an
intramural left coronary artery<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>. In our series of patients, we have come across
eight patients with a single ostial opening from Sinus 2 (one of them had kissing
edges) with intramural course of both left and right coronary arteries, which is
very rare<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>.
None of the patients in our series had supra commisural origin of intramural
coronary artery.</p><p>The single button aortocoronary flap technique for intramural coronary artery is
associated with a high incidence of coronary complication, especially when the
arrangement of the great arteries is anterior and posterior. In that case, the neo
pulmonary artery may compress the coronary button and it can cause myocardial
ischemia in the immediate postoperative period and, in the long term, there is a
possibility of coronary arterial stenosis when the covering tissue does not grow or
shrink<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>. We have no practical
experience with the single button technique.</p><p>We believe that the creation of two buttons and the transfer of the coronary button
to the neo aorta in usual fashion is more physiological, preventing any early or
late coronary artery compression and related complications.</p><p>The successful surgical treatment for bilateral intramural coronary arteries has been
reported earlier<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>. Our technique of creating
two buttons and transferring them in usual fashion is a technical modification of
the technique described by Asou et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>, and we believe that the incidence of accidental
injury to coronary artery is least with our technique.</p><p>Our technique of using coronary shunts for identifying the course of the intramural
coronary artery and its unroofing is very useful, especially when there is stenosis
of the ostium of the left intramural coronary artery. The color of the shunt
(usually blue) can be seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>) through
the aortic intima and the entire course of the intramural portion of the coronary
artery can be delineated. The stay stitch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure
2D</xref>) provides full control over intimal tissue flap and helps in the
unroofing up to the distal portion of the intramural segment. As the coronary shunts
are atraumatic and are easily available in various sizes, probing of the intramural
coronary artery with metallic coronary probes should be avoided since they may cause
trauma to intima as well as dissection and the possibility of late ostial stenosis.
In the past, we have also reported the use of coronary shunts for giving ostial
cardioplegia<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>. The bulbous end of the shunt obliterates the internal
opening of the coronary artery and prevents it from any accidental trauma during
unroofing while the entire length of the coronary shunt prevents any accidental
injury to the tissue around the coronary ostia. We have observed that, with our
modified technique, the distal portion of the intramural segment (where the coronary
artery actually leaves the aortic wall) can also be opened, which remains
potentially stenotic.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>ASO is a preferred operation for TGA. However, performing arterial switch in the
presence of intramural coronary artery is still challenging in pediatric cardiac
surgery, even in experienced hands. Our technique is simple, atraumatic, and it
helps to outline the course of intramural coronary arteries, to unroof the
intramural coronary artery and to create two buttons. We have observed that, with
our technique, ASO in the presence of intramural coronary artery can be performed in
routine fashion with acceptable results.</p><table-wrap id="t5" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="10%" span="1"/><col width="90%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1">

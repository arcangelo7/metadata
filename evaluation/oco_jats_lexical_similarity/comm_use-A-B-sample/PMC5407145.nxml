revascularization of visceral arteries followed by endograft coverage of the
thoracoabdominal aorta. It eliminates the need for a thoracotomy and aortic
clamping, but requires the performance of several technically demanding
visceral anastomosis. In 2008, Lachat described visceral revascularization
with the use of a sutureless distal anastomosis, performed by the
telescoping of an endograft in the visceral branch, named VORTEC (Viabahn

dissection and temporary occlusion of the vessels. This technique was initially
described by Alexis Carrel, in 1902<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>, and despite several technical improvements it
has remained basically the same.</p><p>Several devices for sutureless anastomosis were developed since that time, as grafts
with rings<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>, connectors<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>, clips<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup><sup>]</sup> and even
magnets<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>.</p><p>In complex aortic surgeries, the time to perform an anastomosis is related to
ischemic and reperfusion injuries and can lead to renal failure, mesenteric ischemia
and systemic inflammatory response. Thus, is advisable to simplify and shorten this
period of the surgery.</p><p>In 2008, Lachat et al.<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup><sup>]</sup> described a technique of sutureless anastomosis by
telescoping a stent graft (Viabahn, W. L. Gore &#x00026; Associates, Flagstaff, AZ) in
order to facilitate complex vascular reconstruction in debranching procedures for
thoracoabdominal aneurysms. The advantages of this technique are: less dissection of
the vessel, lower the ischemic time and simplification of the procedure.</p><p>This technique was described solely to distal anastomosis. If also applicable to
proximal anastomosis it could enhance its applicability, as in the case of
laparoscopic aortic anastomosis.</p><p>The objective of this experiment was to test the Viabahn Open Revascularization
TEChnique (VORTEC) technique in a swine model, by the construction of an
aorto-aortic graft and evaluating the feasibility of the use of the technique in the
proximal position. We evaluated the technical success, the time required to perform
the anastomosis, the gross macroscopic appearance, and the sealing and the tensile
strength of the sutured anastomosis compared to the telescoped anastomosis. The
proximal placement of the telescoped graft will, in theory, submit the anastomosis
to increased hemodynamic stress in relation to the distal position, which could
result in increased rate of migration and leaks. If this model proves successful,
the VORTEC technique could be proposed for a broader range of applications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>This study was approved by the Ethical Committee on the Use of Animals of the
Institution (protocol 2737-1). The experiment was carried out on eleven female
large-white pigs weighting approximately 30 kg. The animals were submitted to
general anesthesia with orotracheal intubation, peripheral venous access and
invasive arterial pressure monitoring. A median laparotomy was performed exposing
the abdominal aorta from the renal arteries to the aortic trifurcation, and the
aorta was ligated midway with 2-0 silk. Above the ligature the aorta was punctured
with an 18G needle, a 0.035" guidewire was passed to the thoracic aorta and an 18F
sheath was introduced 2 cm into the aorta. A 5 mm Viabahn graft was introduced 2 cm
into the aorta according to markings previously placed on the sheath. After
deploying the endograft, the sheath was removed and the graft was clamped close to
its exit from the aortic wall. The distal aorta was transected and a conventional
sutured anastomosis was performed between the endograft and the distal aorta with
running 5-0 polypropylene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>
<fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Completed aorto-aortic bypass. The proximal anastomosis is performed

running polypropylene suture manner.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-31-06-0440-g01"/></fig>
</p><p>The patency of the graft was tested by the palpation of the distal pulses and testing
with a continuous wave Doppler examination. After completion of the anastomosis,
intra-venous adrenaline was injected in order to raise the arterial blood pressure
above the normal pressure to check for sealing.</p><p>It was annotated the time to perform each anastomosis, the presence of bleeding
and/or dislodgment of the endograft.</p><p>The animals were divided into two groups. In Group 1, the animals were sacrificed
immediately after the operation. In Group 2, the animals were sacrificed after
thirty days, meanwhile they were kept at the animal lab's facilities.</p><p>After the sacrifice, the anatomic specimen containing the abdominal aorta and the
graft was collected for evaluation of a possible displacement of the endograft,
presence of stenosis and pseudoaneurysms. In three animals (one in Group 1 and two
in Group 2) it was performed a tensile strength test of the anastomosis. This test
was done at the Faculty of Agriculture Engineering of the University of Campinas
utilizing a press (Otawa Texture Co.), weight cells (Berg Cell), a signal amplifier
(Kyowa) and the software DAQWARE, according to previous studies performed on the
biomechanics of tendons<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed in the software G-power for the estimation of the
sample size and the software IBM's Statistical Package for the Social Sciences for
the analysis of the Student t test, for the comparison of time and tensile
strength.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The immediate success of the procedure was 100% as the aorto-aortic graft was
completed in all animals. No bleeding was observed from the anastomosis or endograft
displacement after the injection of adrenaline to raise the arterial blood pressure
after the procedure.</p><p>The time to perform the VORTEC anastomosis was shorter compared to the sutured
anastomosis (5.4&#x000b1;2.8 min <italic>versus</italic> 10.3&#x000b1;3.4 min,
<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>

</p><p>Two animals in Group 2 died on post-operative day one. Necropsy revealed that one
animal died from intestinal rupture secondary to intestinal obstruction. In the
other animal no cause was identified. A patent graft with no signs of anastomotic
rupture was observed in both animals and there was no hemoperitonium.</p><p>In the remaining four animals, one graft was found occluded secondary to intimal
hyperplasia. The remaining grafts were patent, with no signs of pseudoaneurysms or
graft displacement.</p><p>The tensile strength test was performed in three animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). On the animal of Group 1 it was found that the
sutured anastomosis had a higher strength [22.7 <italic>versus</italic> 14.3 Newton
(N), <italic>P</italic>=0.09], as expected, since the proximal anastomosis was
anchored only by the radial force of the stent graft. On Group 2, two animals were
submitted to the test. It was found no difference between the tensile strength of
the sutured and VORTEC anastomosis (37.3 <italic>versus</italic> 40.8 N
respectively, <italic>P</italic>=0.17). The increase in tensile strength was
probably secondary to the intense fibrous tissue that was found around the operation
site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>

</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The VORTEC technique was developed to facilitate the revascularization of the aortic
branches during the correction of complex aneurysms. The main advantages would be
less dissection of the vessels, lower the ischemic time and simplification of the
procedure, decreasing the operative time<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. This technique is being successfully
employed in the treatment of juxta-renal, thoracoabdominal and aortic arch
aneurysms<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. Besides aortic procedures, it has been used in
infra-inguinal revascularization with heavily calcified
arteries<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>.</p><p>In 2012, W.L. Gore &#x00026; Associates launched on the market the endograft Hybrid, a
variation of the Viabahn stent graft, specifically designed to perform this
technique because on one end it is a conventional expanded polytetrafluoroethylene
graft (ePTFE) graft which facilitates the conventional suture. The other extremity
is a stent graft designed for being telescoped into the receptor vessel.</p><p>In all these studies the purpose of these grafts was to facilitate the distal
anastomosis. This study had the objective to evaluate the performance of this
technique as proximal anastomosis, which could broaden the use of this
technique.</p><p>It was found that the immediate technical success was 100%, the VORTEC technique was
faster to perform, as expected, since it requires only the puncture of the vessel
under direct visualization, the placement of the sheath and the deployment of the
stent graft. Even though the telescoped anastomosis had a smaller immediate tensile
strength, after 30 days there was no difference between the two techniques. We
believe this is secondary to the formation of fibrous tissue around the anastomosis
as observed in the explanted material.</p><p>Of course, there are concerns about complications in the long term, such as leakage,
kinking and graft occlusion. However, in the short term, this technique applied in
the proximal anastomosis confection seems to be very promising.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This study has demonstrated, in a swine model, the feasibility of performing the
VORTEC anastomosis in a donor, or proximal position. The technique was faster than
the conventional suture technique and after 30 days had a similar tensile strength.
This may open the use of this technique in complex debranching procedures, totally
telescoped grafts and even facilitating the laparoscopic aortic
anastomosis<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. New hybrid devices may be developed for these
applications.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup width="50%" span="1"><col span="1"/><col span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1"><bold>Authors' roles &#x00026;

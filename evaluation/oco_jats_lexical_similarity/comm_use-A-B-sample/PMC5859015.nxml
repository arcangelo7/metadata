However, the mechanisms of osteocyte mechanotransduction remain poorly understood. We&#x02019;ve previously shown that osteocyte mechanosensitivity is encoded through unique intracellular calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) dynamics. Here, by simultaneously monitoring Ca<sup>2+</sup> and actin dynamics in single cells exposed to fluid shear flow, we detected actin network contractions immediately upon onset of flow-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, which were facilitated by smooth muscle myosin and further confirmed in native osteocytes ex vivo. Actomyosin contractions have been linked to the secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs), and our studies demonstrate that mechanical stimulation upregulates EV production in osteocytes through immunostaining for the secretory vesicle marker Lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) and quantifying EV release in conditioned medium, both of which are blunted when Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling was inhibited by neomycin. Axial tibia compression was used to induce anabolic bone formation responses in mice, revealing upregulated LAMP1 and expected downregulation of sclerostin in vivo. This load-related increase in LAMP1 expression was inhibited in neomycin-injected mice compared to vehicle. Micro-computed tomography revealed significant load-related increases in both trabecular bone volume fraction and cortical thickness after two weeks of loading, which were blunted by neomycin treatment. In summary, we found mechanical stimulation of osteocytes activates Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent contractions and enhances the production and release of EVs containing bone regulatory proteins. Further, blocking Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling significantly attenuates adaptation to mechanical loading in vivo, suggesting a critical role for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated signaling in bone adaptation.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="LongSummary"><title>How bone grows in response to loading</title><p id="Par2">People gain bone in response to exercise and lose it during prolonged bedrest; now we&#x02019;re closer to understanding how this happens.</p><p id="Par3">Bone cells called osteocytes act as mechanical sensors, responding to changes in force by regulating the activity of bone-forming osteoblasts and bone- resorbing osteoclasts.

Osteocytes are long-lived, dendritic cells embedded as an interconnected network within the mineralized bone matrix in the lacunar-canalicular system (LCS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. As techniques for isolating and evaluating these cells have advanced, the essential role of osteocytes in bone metabolism has become widely recognized. Osteocytes are the mechanosensors of bone tissue, as well as the primary source of sclerostin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, a negative regulator of the bone-forming osteoblasts, and receptor activator of nuclear factor &#x003ba;B ligand (RANKL)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, an activating factor of bone-resorbing osteoclasts, both of which are targets for agents evaluated as treatments for osteoporosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Despite surmounting evidence regarding the importance of osteocytes, the mechanisms by which mechanical stimulation influences osteocyte protein production and protein regulation impacts effector cell adaptive responses remain poorly understood.</p><p id="Par6">We have previously shown osteocyte mechanosensitivity to be encoded through unique intracellular calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) dynamics. When exposed to fluid shear in vitro and dynamic deformational loading of whole bones ex vivo, osteocytes exhibit robust, unattenuated oscillations in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, dependent on extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and the second messenger, ATP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Furthermore, we have shown that release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores contributes to these robust responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in osteocytes are distinct from those of osteoblasts, more abundant than autonomous signals, and become more pronounced under increasing mechanical loading magnitudes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Though Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals can regulate diverse cellular functions in multiple cell types, immediate downstream consequences of mechanosensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in osteocytes have yet to be identified.</p><p id="Par7">Mechanical stimuli have been shown to influence the osteocyte cytoskeleton.

In our previous work investigating dynamics of osteocyte cytoskeletal components under flow, we showed that fluid shear introduces strains in the cortical actin network, demonstrating sensitivity of the actin cytoskeleton to mechanical stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the expression of muscle contraction-related proteins is upregulated as bone cells mature into osteocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. However, though a hallmark of all muscle cells is Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent actomyosin contractility, the relationship between Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and cytoskeletal dynamics in osteocytes has yet to be explored.</p><p id="Par8">Vesicle release has recently been highlighted as an important means of intercellular communication, whereby cells package proteins and genetic materials in extracellular vesicles (EVs) to shuttle their contents amongst one another<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.

We hypothesized that mechanically induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in osteocytes induce changes in cortical actin dynamics and influence adaptive bone formation, possibly through the release of bone regulatory proteins in EVs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par22">First, we examined contractility of the actin cytoskeleton as an immediate effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics and actin network strains were simultaneously measured using the multichannel quasi-3D microscopy technique (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). We detected contractions in the actin network of MLO-Y4 cells following the initiation of flow-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, as indicated by a decrease in the average intracellular actin normal strain in the height of the cell (Ezz) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b, c</xref>). These contractile strains were observed in 70% of the osteocytes that were recorded, regardless of whether flow-induced tensile actin strains preceded Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. To further confirm the dependence of actin network contraction on Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics, ATP, a known osteocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling mediator<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, and ionomycin were used to chemically stimulate a Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in the absence of mechanical load. Within several seconds, compression in all measured normal strains was visible, indicative of a whole-cell contraction (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d, e</xref>). Ezz height strain tended to have the largest compression, while shear strains were not affected. ATP stimulated cells displayed a recovery to baseline (~180&#x02009;s), demonstrating a reversible, phasic contraction.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Osteocytes exhibit phasic, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent actin contractions. <bold>a</bold> Quasi-3D multi-emission imaging of single MLO-Y4 cells under flow. <bold>b</bold> Bottom-view and side-view contours of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and actin network strains in a single MLO-Y4 osteocyte double-transfected with a Ca<sup>2+</sup> FRET biosensor and a Lifeact-mkate2 actin probe. <bold>c</bold> Representative traces for actin strains and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in response to fluid flow, with Ezz (black trace) decreasing immediately after Ca<sup>2+</sup> initiation (dark blue trace), regardless of any tensile positive strains which developed at the onset of flow. <bold>d</bold> A Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient induced by ATP results in a phasic contractile response in all normal strains. <bold>e</bold> Ionomycin induces a step-increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and overall decreases in normal strains.

In MLO-Y4 cells, smooth muscle myosin-II ATPase and its SM2 isoform were detected along with non-muscle myosin and MLCK via Western blot. Immunodetection of smooth muscle myosin and the actin network in primary osteocytes showed co-localization of the two (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Western blots failed to detect skeletal muscle contraction-related proteins, including skeletal myosin, skeletal &#x003b1;-actin, skeletal myosin ATPase, or skeletal/cardiac troponins, and all Western blot results were confirmed using lysates of FACS-sorted DMP1topaz(+) cells, verifying that primary osteocytes are similar to MLO-Y4 osteocytes in this regard (data not shown). ATP-stimulated cells were treated with the MLCK inhibitor ML-7 and imaged by quasi-3D to determine its influence on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent contractility (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>).

Therefore, the kinetics of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent actomyosin contractions appear to be mediated by smooth-muscle myosin.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent contractions in osteocytes are mediated by smooth muscle myosin. <bold>a</bold> Western blots for smooth muscle myosin proteins in NIH3T3 fibroblast cells, osteoblast cell line MC3T3-E1, and osteocyte cell line MLO-Y4.

Interestingly, as osteoblasts differentiate into osteocytes, changes in cytoskeleton arrangement and distribution of structural elements occur, including formation of a dense cortical actin shell, as well as actin-enriched structures that extend the entire length of the dendrites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Furthermore, gene expression related to muscle function, development, and differentiation of skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle have been detected in osteocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. While smooth muscle contractile dynamics have been extensively characterized in other cell types, we are for the first time presenting this Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent contractile behavior in osteocytes in a mechanosensitive context.</p><p id="Par31">We further found that mechanically induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations also influence the release of EVs by osteocytes. Vesicle-like structures have been detected in osteocyte networks in situ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, and osteocyte-like cells have been shown to produce EVs enriched in bone-regulatory miRNAs that can be endocytosed by osteoblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Though not directly evaluated in this study, our results suggest that actin networks, which have been previously implicated in mechanically induced protein responses in osteocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, may also play a role in the regulation of EV production by mechanical loading. The technique used to prepare these vesicle fractions from osteocytes as well as the characterization of particle size suggest that these membrane vesicles are likely exosomes or microvesicles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. A recent in situ morphological study showed strong co-localization of RANKL to vesicle-like structures positive for LAMP1 in osteocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> and OPG-positive structures in canaliculi with diameter measurements reported as ~200&#x02009;nm, in line with previously published values<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Based on these and our own in vitro findings detecting sclerostin, RANKL, and OPG in mechanically induced EVs, we posit that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated EV release is a plausible means by which osteocytes coordinate tissue-level bone adaptation in response to mechanosensation.</p><p id="Par32">Finally, employing an established model for murine uniaxial tibia loading, we sought to strengthen the link between Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and a functional role in bone adaptation by examining changes in osteocyte protein expression and bone formation response both with and without inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. Our immunostaining data for LAMP1, a marker of intracellular secretory vesicles, both in vitro and in vivo suggests that EV production is enhanced with loading, and that osteocyte mechanosensation through Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations plays a role in modulating levels of this EV production. Neomycin abolishment of typical load-induced anabolic bone formation responses in C57BL/6J mice subjected to loading demonstrates that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is not only essential for mechanosensation, but also key in the long term adaptive response of bone to mechanical loading. Downregulation of sclerostin in response to mechanical loading, on the other hand, appears to be unaltered by neomycin and therefore independent of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated mechanosensation. Sclerostin suppresses bone formation by antagonizing osteoblasts through the canonical-WNT pathway, and multiple studies suggest that sclerostin downregulation is necessary for bone formation to occur<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Interestingly, we note differences between in vitro release of sclerostin-containing EVs and downregulation of intracellular sclerostin protein expression in osteocytes in vivo, suggesting sclerostin responses to mechanical load may be more nuanced than previously described and warranting further study of this bone regulatory protein and a potential focus on its intercellular transport. Overall, our results demonstrate that inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> mechanosensation attenuates bone formation despite a downregulation of sclerostin, suggesting that other biochemical signals and mechanisms may be responsible for the full adaptive response.</p><p id="Par33">While our multi-scale approach presents new findings of mechanically induced Ca<sup>2+</sup>oscillations in osteocytes resulting in actomyosin contractions, EV release, and bone adaptive responses, we recognize some limitations and future work necessary to enhance our studies. Ongoing research in our laboratory seeks to experimentally link these observations. For instance, inhibiting osteocyte actomyosin contractions independent of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling would further strengthen the proposed link between the contractions we observe, their influence on osteocyte EV release, and the bone adaptive response. We, along with Solberg and colleagues, acknowledge that the presence of LAMP1 staining in osteocytes does not directly classify these structures as secretory. It would be of future interest to confirm that these structures are indeed EVs via additional markers, as well as identify these structures in the LCS to strengthen their functional role in bone adaptation and cell-cell communication. Further studies are also necessary to determine if and how EVs produced by osteocytes travel along the extended dendritic processes and through the LCS to the bone surface. Of note, it is still unknown how osteocytes send biochemical signals from within the bone matrix to cells on the bone surface, which carry out the adaptive processes we observe here.</p><p id="Par34">This work presents evidence of a novel pathway where osteocytes under mechanical loading can regulate bone metabolism by directly controlling osteocyte-specific protein release through EVs. Avenues of further study of this mechanotransduction mechanism in bone are accessible, as similar mechanisms of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent cell contractions and cytoskeletal influence on EV release have been well studied in other cell types. This provides a new direction to better understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms of bone response to mechanical stimuli, as well as the roles of key bone regulatory proteins, such as RANKL and sclerostin, which may be the target of anti-osteoporosis drugs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="Par10">Osteocyte-like MLO-Y4 cells were maintained on collagen-coated tissue culture dishes in minimum essential alpha medium (&#x003b1;-MEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 5% calf serum and kept at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in a humidified incubator.

Prepared slides were deparaffinized in xylenes, rehydrated through graded ethanol, and heat-mediated antigen retrieval was performed to unmask antigens. Blocking of endogenous peroxidase activity was performed (0.1% sodium azide with 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in dH<sub>2</sub>O), followed by protein block for 1&#x02009;h (0.3% Triton X-100 in 4% BSA). Sections were then treated overnight at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C with antibodies against sclerostin (1&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x000b7;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, Abcam) or LAMP1 (2.5&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x000b7;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, Abcam). Detection was performed using the Vectastain ABC HRP kit and developed with the ImmPACT DAB Peroxidase (HRP) Substrate kit (Vector Laboratories). Hematoxylin was used as a counterstain (Sigma-Aldrich). Slides were then dehydrated, cleared with xylenes and cover slipped using Permount (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Proximal tibial sections containing portions of growth plate and articular cartilage were processed identically and served as positive controls, as hypertrophic chondrocytes also stain for LAMP1 and sclerostin in these respective regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Negative controls were sections processed simultaneously with no primary antibody in diluent for that step. For quantification, the interosseous crest (IC) of transverse sections was imaged live using a &#x000d7;60 oil-immersion objective and Osteomeasure (Osteometrics, Atlanta, GA) was employed to mark all positive and negative osteocytes in this region. The largest compressive loads, load-related change in sclerostin expression, and increases in cortical thickness have all been previously shown to occur at the IC in the mid-shaft of the tibia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Three, blinded observers recorded both total number and positive osteocytes (observed with brown staining in &#x0003e;50% of cell) in each section, and 3 or 4 non-consecutive sections were counted from each tibia for each protein. The average percent of positive osteocytes from the three observations was obtained for each section, and the average of all sections from a single tibia was used for final comparisons. Comparisons were made between the loaded and non-loaded limb for each animal.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Micro-computed tomography (&#x003bc;CT)</title><p id="Par20">Trabecular and cortical morphological parameters were assessed via micro-computed tomography using a Scanco VivaCT 40 system (Scanco Medical AG, Br&#x000fc;ttisellen, Switzerland). Scanning parameters were 55&#x02009;kVp energy, 109&#x02009;&#x000b5;A intensity, and 300&#x02009;ms integration time; reconstructed images had 10.5&#x02009;&#x000b5;m isotropic voxel size. Prior to all analyses, a Gaussian filter was applied (sigma&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.8, support&#x02009;=&#x02009;1) to reduce noise. The trabecular region of interest was defined starting approximately 50&#x02009;&#x000b5;m below the growth plate and extending 1.05&#x02009;mm distally. The cortical region of interest was set at 1.05&#x02009;mm in length, centered midway between the tibial plateau and the distal tibiofibular junction. This reproducible landmark has been shown previously to be the site of highest strains in uniaxial tibia loading<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Global thresholds of 30% and 35% of the maximum gray scale value were used to classify trabecular and cortical bone, respectively. Standard Scanco evaluation software was used in the calculation of output parameters.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par21">Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-tests were performed to compare differences in means for cell contraction initiation and micropillar displacement.

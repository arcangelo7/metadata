substantially worse than among girls and women, yet this gender-based disparity in
health has received little national, regional or global acknowledgement or attention
from health policy-makers or health-care providers. Including both women and men in
efforts to reduce gender inequalities in health as part of the post-2015 sustainable
development agenda would improve everyone&#x02019;s health and well-being.</p><p>That men tend to be in worse health than women has now been made clear by robust evidence
from various sources. The Global Burden of Disease study led by the Institute for Health
Metrics and Evaluation in 2010 (GBD 2010 study) showed that throughout the period from
1970 to 2010, women had a longer life expectancy than men.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Over that 40-year period, female life expectancy at birth
increased from 61.2&#x000a0;to 73.3&#x000a0;years, whereas male life expectancy rose from
56.4&#x000a0;to 67.5&#x000a0;years. These figures indicate that the gap in life expectancy
at birth widened between the sexes to men&#x02019;s disadvantage over those 40 years.</p><p>By 2010, on the whole women were outliving men by an average of almost six years. In the
region with the lowest life expectancy at birth &#x02212; central sub-Saharan Africa
&#x02212; men were living 5.3&#x000a0;years less than women on average. Eastern Europe
showed the biggest difference in life expectancy between men and women: women in the
Russian Federation were outliving men by an average of 11.6&#x000a0;years. According to
the <italic>Global health 2035</italic> report, published in the<italic> Lancet</italic>
in 2013, in countries classified as &#x0201c;least developed&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;less
developed&#x0201d; by the United Nations adult mortality fell faster among women than
among men between 1992 and 2012.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref></p><sec><title>Explaining the gender gap</title><p>In many societies, men generally enjoy more opportunities, privileges and power than
women, yet these multiple advantages do not translate into better health outcomes.
What explains this gender disparity? According to the WHO European Region&#x02019;s
review of the social determinants of health, chaired by Sir Michael Marmot,
men&#x02019;s poorer survival rates &#x0201c;reflect several factors &#x02013; greater
levels of occupational exposure to physical and chemical hazards, behaviours
associated with male norms of risk-taking and adventure, health behaviour paradigms
related to masculinity and the fact that men are less likely to visit a doctor when
they are ill and, when they see a doctor, are less likely to report on the symptoms
of disease or illness&#x0201d;.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref></p><p>How much more likely to die are men than women as a result of risk-taking behaviours?
In 2010, 3.14 million men &#x02212; as opposed to 1.72 million women &#x02212; died
from causes linked to excessive alcohol use.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> For many men, excessive consumption of alcohol is
linked to notions of masculinity. For example, a study of men in the Russian
Federation showed that heavy drinking of strong spirits &#x0201c;elevates or
maintains a man&#x02019;s status in working-class social groups by facilitating
access to power associated with the hegemonic ideal of the real working
man&#x0201d;.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Of 67 risk
factors and risk factor clusters identified in the GBD 2010 study, 60 were
responsible for more male than female deaths and the top 10 risk factors were all
more common in men.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref></p><p>In many countries, research suggests that women are more likely than men to use
health services, although this disparity may reflect women&#x02019;s increased use of
services during their reproductive years.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> For example, in England in 2008 and 2009, women aged 15 to
80 years had significantly more consultations with general practitioners than men;
the biggest gender gap was noted in the 20- to 44-year age group.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> In a Lithuanian study of
middle-aged university employees, women were found to be significantly more likely
than men to get regular dental check-ups.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref></p><p>Several recent studies in Malawi, South Africa, Uganda and Zimbabwe suggest that
notions of masculinity not only increase the risk of infection with the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but they also inhibit men from getting tested for HIV,
coming to terms with their HIV-positive status, taking instructions from nurses, and
engaging in health-enabling behaviours.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Cornell et al. have argued that we have a &#x0201c;blind
spot&#x0201d; when it comes to men and antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Africa. These
researchers note, for example, that disproportionately fewer men than women access
ART across Africa, that men start ART later in the disease course than women, and
that men are more likely than women to interrupt treatment and be lost to
follow-up.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref>
</p><p>Finally, the highly gendered nature of employment in all societies translates into
men being more exposed to occupationally related morbidity and mortality than women.
In 2010, almost 750&#x02009;000 men died from occupationally related causes, as
opposed to just over 102&#x02009;000 women.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> In Europe, 95% of fatal accidents and 76% of non-fatal
accidents at the workplace are experienced by men.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> In the United States of America, the occupations with
the highest risk of fatal occupational injury, such as mining, agriculture and
fishing, employ far more men than women.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref></p></sec><sec><title>Policy silence at global health institutions</title><p>As Hawkes &#x00026; Buse recently noted, the gender disparities noted earlier are not
properly addressed in the health policies and programmes of the major global health
institutions, including WHO.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref>
Policy-makers tend to assume that gendered approaches to health improvement are
primarily or exclusively about women rather than about both sexes, a position also
adopted by most national governments. To the best of our knowledge, only three
countries &#x02013; Australia, Brazil and Ireland &#x02013; have to date attempted to
address men&#x02019;s burden of ill health through the adoption of national,
male-centred strategies.</p><p>Compounding this neglect by policy-makers are negative stereotypes of men on the part
of many health-care providers. For instance, some assume that men are largely
disinterested in their health &#x02013; an attitude that can, in turn, discourage men
from engaging with health services.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Barker et al. have noted that &#x0201c;health programs
often view men mainly as oppressors &#x02013; self-centred, disinterested, or violent
&#x02013; instead of as complex subjects whose behaviours are influenced by gender
and sexual norms&#x0201d;.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref></p><p>Any serious effort to improve public health must include attention to the health
needs of both sexes and responsiveness to the differences between them. Attention to
men&#x02019;s and women&#x02019;s health will be particularly important in tackling
the global epidemic of noncommunicable diseases, which are likely to affect more men
than women and to affect men at a younger age.</p><p>Taking action is not just a matter of equity; it is also a matter of economics. For
example, men&#x02019;s underuse of primary care services in Denmark results in their
use of more expensive hospital services instead,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> while men&#x02019;s premature mortality and morbidity
cost the United States economy alone an estimated 479 billion United States dollars
annually.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref></p></sec><sec><title>Policy targets and effective interventions</title><p>White et al. have argued that public and policy action to improve men&#x02019;s health
should have three targets.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> The
first is schools, where stereotypes about masculinity can be challenged. The second
is the promotion of men&#x02019;s health and well-being in the workplace. A third
crucial area for policy is to target health services and health promotion towards
marginalized men, men from minority populations, men in prison populations and men
who have sex with men &#x02013; all of whom have a higher burden of disease and early
death than other men.</p><p>Three types of intervention targeting men have emerged in recent years &#x02013;
outreach, partnership and gender transformation &#x02013; and there is now evidence
to support all three approaches. Interventions in high-income countries (e.g.
Australia, the United States and countries of western Europe) have generally
involved outreach efforts aimed at men in pubs and bars, sports clubs, barber shops,
schools and the workplace, with a focus on weight loss, smoking cessation and other
lifestyle changes. In a recent randomized controlled trial of a gender-sensitized
weight loss and healthy living programme for overweight or obese male soccer fans at
13 Scottish professional soccer clubs, the intervention led to significant weight
loss.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref></p><p>A second approach involves partnering with men to improve women&#x02019;s and
children&#x02019;s health. For example, research in Ghana has shown that child
vaccination programmes designed to involve fathers (not just mothers) in decisions
about their children's use of preventive health services may increase timely
immunization coverage levels.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref>
Similarly, systematic reviews of studies conducted in low- and middle-income
countries have shown the benefits of engaging male partners in decisions about
reproductive and sexual health, including family planning.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref></p><p>A third approach, which is being increasingly supported by evidence from randomized
controlled trials and other types of studies, is to support interventions aimed at
gender transformation. These aim to reshape male gender roles in ways that lead to
more equitable relationships between women and men. Such interventions can increase
protective sexual behaviours, prevent intimate partner violence, modify inequitable
attitudes linked to gender, and reduce sexually transmitted infections.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref></p></sec><sec><title>A global men&#x02019;s health movement</title><p>WHO&#x02019;s Regional Office for Europe has made a bold commitment to
&#x0201c;addressing the impact of gender on men's health and involving men in
achieving gender equity in the WHO European Region through WHO programmes or direct
support to Member States&#x0201d;.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> However, it is unclear what actions the office has taken
to date or is planning for the future. In 2011, the European Commission published a
comprehensive report, <italic>The state of men&#x02019;s health in
Europe</italic>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> but an
action plan based on its findings has not yet been produced.</p><p>Global, regional and national health and development agencies could certainly learn
from the success of civil society groups in promoting policies that target men. For
example, the South African non-profit organization Sonke Gender Justice successfully
pushed the government to add interventions targeting men within South
Africa&#x02019;s national HIV strategic plan. The charity Men&#x02019;s Health Forum
(England and Wales) was instrumental in persuading the government of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to extend the national chlamydia
screening programme to cover young people of both sexes rather than primarily
women.</p><p>Given the robust evidence of a &#x0201c;men&#x02019;s health gap&#x0201d; and the
emerging evidence on how to close it, the next step is to move the issue higher up
on the agenda of national governments and global health institutions without
diminishing efforts to improve women&#x02019;s health. A new organization, Global
Action on Men&#x02019;s Health, has recently been established by men&#x02019;s health
organizations around the world to advocate for national, regional and global public
health policies that take account of men as well as women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The GBD 2010 study has, we hope, helped to raise awareness of the excess burden of
morbidity and mortality in men. Concerted global action to reduce this burden could
have a transformative social, health and economic impact. It is time to not only
acknowledge the benefits of such action to men, but also to recognize and measure
its potential benefits to women, children and society as a whole. Men&#x02019;s
physical illness, for example, can impair the psychological health of their female
partners; when men are sick, injured or die, households and female partners suffer a
loss of income.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> Closing the
men&#x02019;s health gap can benefit men, women and their children.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements: </title><p>We thank Sarah Hawkes, Reader in Global Health at University College London&#x02019;s

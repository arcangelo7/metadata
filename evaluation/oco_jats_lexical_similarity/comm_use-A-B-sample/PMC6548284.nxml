Here, we investigate the effect of risedronate on BMD after 5&#x0202f;years of follow-up in the IBIS-II prevention trial. 1410 women were enrolled in the bone sub-study and stratified into three strata according to the lowest baseline T-score at spine or femoral neck. The objective was to compare the effect of oral risedronate (35&#x0202f;mg weekly) versus placebo in osteopenic women in stratum II who were randomised to anastrozole in the main study. 258 osteopenic, postmenopausal women at high risk of developing breast cancer for whom baseline and follow-up bone mineral density measurements were available. 5-year mean BMD change at the lumbar spine for osteopenic women randomised to anastrozole and risedronate was &#x02212;0.4% compared to &#x02212;4.2% for those not on risedronate (<italic>P</italic>&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.0001) but not significantly different between risedronate users and non-users at the hip (<italic>P</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;0.2). 5-year mean PINP change was &#x02212;20% for those randomised to anastrozole and risedronate compared to 3% for those not on risedronate but on anastrozole (<italic>P</italic>&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.0001). Our results confirm the bone loss associated with the use of anastrozole and show that anastrozole-induced BMD loss in the spine can be controlled with risedronate treatment. However, our results suggest that weekly oral risedronate is unable to completely prevent anastrozole induced bone loss at the hip.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="ab0010"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="l0005"><list-item id="li0005"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0005">Results confirm anastrozole induced bone mineral density decrease in women at increased risk of developing breast cancer</p></list-item><list-item id="li0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010">Risedronate counterbalances the negative effect of anastrozole induced bone mineral density loss at the lumbar spine</p></list-item><list-item id="li0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">Long-term intake of risedronate did not prevent bone loss at the total hip in osteopenic women</p></list-item><list-item id="li0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0020">N-Terminal Propeptide of Type I Collagen (PINP) can predict bone mineral density changes</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="ks0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Osteopenia</kwd><kwd>Bone mineral density</kwd><kwd>Anastrozole</kwd><kwd>Risedronate</kwd><kwd>Bone marker</kwd><kwd>Breast cancer risk</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0025">Postmenopausal women are at high risk of developing osteoporosis (low mineral bone density (BMD)) due to decreasing levels of estrogen. Early postmenopausal BMD loss is estimated to be between 1 and 3% per year at the spine and 1 to 2% per year at the hip [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Bisphosphonates, which increase BMD by inhibiting osteoclast-mediated bone resorption [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], can prevent bone loss in postmenopausal women.</p><p id="p0030">Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) have become the standard adjuvant treatment option for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive breast cancer. The risk of BMD loss, and therefore fractures, in this patient population is increased due to AIs ability to suppress estrogen levels by inhibiting the conversion of androgens to estrogens by the aromatase enzyme in soft tissues, especially fat. The majority of studies investigating the effect of AIs on BMD have been performed in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer receiving adjuvant tamoxifen as a comparison group, which has been shown to have a beneficial effect on BMD [<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Most studies demonstrating a beneficial effect of bisphosphonates on the bone have been performed in breast cancer patients receiving an AI [<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>], and little is known about the effect of bisphosphonates in healthy postmenopausal women who are at risk of developing the disease.</p><p id="p0035">The IBIS-II trial compared anastrozole with placebo in postmenopausal women at high risk of developing breast cancer and found a significant 53% reduction in breast cancer with anastrozole [<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Due to these results, anastrazole has been recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for the prevention of breast cancer for postmenopausal women with family history. We have previously reported that 3&#x0202f;years of oral risedronate can prevent BMD loss in osteopenic and osteoporotic postmenopausal women who were receiving anastrozole [<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Furthermore, this was the first study to report the effect of anastrozole on BMD loss in healthy postmenopausal women in a placebo-controlled trial. The decrease in BMD and the increase in bone turnover markers with aromatase inhibition would be expected to be associated with an increase in fracture risk, although our study wasn't powered to test for this. Here, we update the IBIS-II bone sub-study results by adding in the bone turnover marker N-Terminal Propeptide of Type I Collagen (PINP) and report in detail on the effect of risedronate on BMD in postmenopausal women with osteopenia.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Study design and participants</title><p id="p0040">We have previously described the study design and eligibility of the IBIS-II bone sub-study [<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].

For this analysis only women from stratum II and those who did not develop breast cancer or died were included. All women were advised, but not required, to take vitamin D and calcium supplements. Exclusion criteria for the bone sub-study included previous bilateral hip fractures, women with any type of metabolic bone disease, and women who have regularly taken medication affecting bone metabolism within the past 12&#x0202f;months prior to study entry. Breast cancer development was the primary endpoint of the IBIS-II trial and women were excluded from the current analysis if they developed breast cancer at any point during the active treatment period.

BMD measurements at the femoral neck are more variable as it relies on a smaller region of the bone than total hip. Therefore, we report here BMD measurements for the total hip. A final DXA scan at 7&#x0202f;years (two years after treatment cessation) was also performed, but these results are not reported here. T-scores were calculated using either the GE-Lunar [<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] or Hologic [<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] manufacturer's reference age-specific ranges for the lumbar spine (L1 to L4) and the NHANES III reference range for the femoral neck region [<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For quality assurance, all baseline and follow-up DXA scans were reviewed centrally by two clinical scientists with expertise in bone densitometry (GMB and RP). Women in stratum II of the bone sub-study were randomised to receive oral risedronate or matching placebo using randomly chosen blocks of size six, eight, or ten to maintain balance. Compliance in stratum II was determined full if women took their allocated risedronate at least 80% over 5&#x0202f;years of follow-up (at least 208&#x0202f;weeks over 5&#x0202f;years). Women who had a BMD loss of 6% or more at the 12&#x0202f;month's visit were furthermore required to have a safety DXA scan at 24&#x0202f;months of follow-up. Similarly, those with a BMD loss of over 10% at 36&#x0202f;months had a safety scan at 48&#x0202f;months, and those with a BMD loss of over 16% at the 60&#x0202f;month's visit, had an interval scan at 72&#x0202f;months.

Risedronate was very well tolerated and no serious adverse events, such as osteonecrosis of the jaw, were reported during the 5&#x0202f;years on treatment. Compliance to risedronate was very good and the exclusion of non-compliant women had no impact on BMD changes.</p><p id="p0115">Apart from the MAP.3 trial [<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], most evidence that AIs have a negative effect on BMD come from adjuvant trials in women with early breast cancer [<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These trials have all shown significant BMD loss with an AI, but have in common that the comparator was tamoxifen, which has been shown to have a beneficial impact on bone [<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Similarly, all other reports that have investigated the effect of a bisphosphonate on BMD in women taking anastrozole come from treatment trials [<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>]. Greenspan et al. found that weekly risedronate improved BMD and decreased bone turnover markers in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive breast cancer who were given an AI for 2&#x0202f;years. Although this was a small study and the follow-up period was relatively short, they demonstrated that measurements of bone markers (C-telopeptide crosslinks type I collagen (CTX) and N-Terminal Propeptide of Type I Collagen (PINP)) can predict BMD changes. We observed correlations between 12-month change in PINP and BMD that were very similar.</p><p id="p0120">One key finding of our study was the observation that long-term risedronate intake wasn't preventing bone loss at the total hip, although it was effective at the lumbar spine. We did not find any evidence that poor compliance with risedronate was responsible for this. Risedronate might not be sufficiently potent in the presence of long-term anastrozole used, which is supported by a lesser effect at 60&#x0202f;months on the PINP changes. Furthermore, our current results differ from previous analysis at the three year follow-up [<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Risedronate clearly is sufficiently potent to prevent hip bone loss in women not receiving anastrozole after 60&#x0202f;months, a finding in keeping with a clinical trial over 60&#x0202f;months in 220 women with osteoporosis [<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We did not observe any reduction in fractures with risedronate irrespective of main randomisation. This is in contrast to adjuvant breast cancer studies, which have shown to significantly reduce the incidence of fractures with bisphosphonates, both vertebral and non-vertebral fractures [<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, these trials have all in common that the comparator was tamoxifen, which has been shown to have beneficial impact on bone [<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Our trial was not designed to investigate the use of risedronate for the prevention of fractures and they were not our primary endpoint. In postmenopausal osteoporosis, the effect of risedronate on non-vertebral fracture reduction is about 20% [<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In the current study, the point estimate of reduction in fracture risk was 9% but in order to detect such a change in fracture risk, a much larger study would need to be performed.</p><p id="p0125">The results from this study in women at risk of developing breast cancer can be compared to previous studies of women with breast cancer treated with aromatase inhibitors. For example, in the ATAC study [<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] the 5-year rate of bone loss at the lumbar spine and total hip were 6.1% and 7.2%, considerably greater than in this preventive study of 4.2% and 3.8%, respectively. It has been considered that women with breast cancer are particularly susceptible to the development of osteoporosis [<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This is somewhat surprising given that the PINP level was similar in the ATAC study and IBIS-II (mean PINP around 55&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/L) and the change in PINP was between 155 and 20% [<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p id="p0130">This analysis has several strengths and limitations. Strengths include a good sample size (<italic>N</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;258) of women with osteopenia and long-term follow-up of 5&#x0202f;years. The population included in this analysis came from a large prevention trial [<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] with excellent clinical records and detailed follow-up. An additional strength of this study is the evaluation of BMD changes and risedronate in a placebo-controlled trial of healthy postmenopausal women who are at increased risk of developing breast cancer. Our results might be useful for women at increased risk of breast cancer who consider taking anastrozole for prevention purposes.</p><p id="p0135">Limitations of our study include the incomplete set of BMD data at 5&#x0202f;years, which was mainly due to withdrawal from the main IBIS-II study due to anastrozole related side effects. Therefore, our results might not be representative for the whole study population. However, when all BMD measurements (incomplete data between baseline, 1, 3, and 5&#x0202f;years) were included in a sensitivity analysis, similar results were observed. Two types of DXA machines were used to assess BMD changes in this study. However, comparisons of BMD changes between Hologic and GE-Lunar scanners did not reveal any significant differences. DXA measurement doesn't take into account bone structure and micro-architecture of the bone, which plays an important role in determining bone strength [<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, it was not possible to assess these structural changes within the remit of the bone sub-study protocol. All women had to stop with bone anabolic therapy or selective estrogen replacement therapy 12&#x0202f;months before joining the IBIS-II trial. Although we did not collect detailed information on medication before the 12&#x0202f;months to trial entry, we do not believe that prior intake of these drugs had any impact on BMD changes during the trial. Lastly, we were not able to measure a bone resorption marker as the only one that can be measured in serum after long-term storage and is reliable is CTX, which needs to be measured in a sample obtained fasting. The reason we measured PINP is that estrogen deficiency results in an increase both in resorption and formation markers (due to coupling) and bisphosphonates result in a decrease in both types of marker.</p></sec><sec id="s0040"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0140">The IBIS-II results strongly support anastrozole for preventive treatment of high risk postmenopausal women [<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This updated analysis in healthy postmenopausal women in a placebo controlled trial confirmed the beneficial effect of risedronate on bone loss at the lumbar spine only in osteopenic women receiving anastrozole. We found that the use of a bisphosphonate and monitoring of bone density by DXA scans can control BMD loss induced at the lumbar spine by anastrozole in the preventive setting. However, bone loss at the hip was not completely prevented and therefore other more potent bisphosphonates (e.g. alendronate, zoledronic acid) for prevention of hip bone loss and fracture need to be investigated in this setting. Risedronate was well tolerated and may provide a therapeutic option to maintain skeletal health in women at increased risk of developing breast cancer.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bi0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bb0005"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sowers</surname><given-names>M.R.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Amount of bone loss in relation to time around the final menstrual period and follicle-stimulating hormone staging of the transmenopause</article-title><source>J.

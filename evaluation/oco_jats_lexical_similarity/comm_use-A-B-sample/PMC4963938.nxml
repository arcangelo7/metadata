Humeral diaphyseal fractures is not uncommon, accounting for between 1 and 3&#x000a0;% of all adult fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and for up to 20&#x000a0;% of all humeral fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] in some populations. It has also been noted to account to severe burden to some populations with consequences including reduced productivity and income [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Most of the studies on humeral diaphyseal fractures had given little attention to epidemiology but focused more to the treatment regimen.</p><p>The epidemiological characteristics of the humeral diaphyseal fractures have been studied in some populations but have received little attention in Nigeria as there is no literature available on the epidemiologic study of risk factors associated with diaphyseal humeral fractures among Nigerians known to our knowledge at the time of this study. Hence, this study was aimed at investigating the possible demographic risk factors associated with humeral diaphyseal fractures among Nigerians. It was hypothesized that age, gender, affected side, fall, and road traffic accidents (RTA) are some of the risk factors associated with diaphyseal humeral fractures. Studies, such as this, should be population-specific so as to obtain a proper epidemiological picture of these fractures as this could vary between populations. Variations could result from racial, socioeconomic, cultural differences as well as urbanization and other populational characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This study could facilitate treatment plans, choices of priorities in training, and proper understanding of orthopedic traumatology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], especially in developing countries where poor road conditions as a result of neglect on the part of the government had led to loss of lives and incapacitations of the citizens.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The study was carried out retrospectively (with ethical approval) at the Department of Medical Records, National Orthopaedic Hospital, Igbobi, Lagos State, Nigeria, using plain of X-ray films (both anteroposterior and lateral views) that were taken between 2007 and 2012 from a total number of 206 patients of ages from birth to one hundred years (0&#x02013;100 years), comprising of 140 males and 66 females that had humeral diaphyseal fractures.

In females, the percentage frequency of diaphyseal humeral fractures was bimodal in distribution having a modal age-group of 21&#x02013;40 years, followed by age-group above 60&#x000a0;years. A retrospective study of 240 fractures of the humeral shaft by Mast et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] had shown that 60&#x000a0;% occurred in the under 35&#x000a0;years old and that there was a fairly even distribution of injury within the shaft. A study by Rose et al.

Another analysis by Tytherleigh-Strong et al.

The percentage of the elderly, especially the females, affected by this injury should prompt a review of treatments. The two commonest methods available had been noted to present challenges when applied in the elderly patients. Plating osteoporotic bone cannot be relied on as a result of poor screw purchase while antegrade intramedullary nailing affects the rotator cuff which can cause significant complications when applied in elderly subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>In both males and females, the main cause (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) of diaphyseal humeral fractures was RTA, followed by fall. However, in females, whereas the main causes were RTA and fall, no statistically significant difference (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05) was found between the two. This is in contrast to a previous study by Tytherleigh-Strong et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] which showed that 80&#x000a0;% of humeral diaphyseal fractures results from simple falls.</p><p>RTA is one of the major causes of mortality across the globe with the developing world more affected. A previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] had shown that lack of airbags in vehicle, non-usage of helmets, and over-speeding are important factors associated with RTA. Bad road conditions such as pot holes, sharp bends, and unstable bridges are all conditions seen in most African and Asian countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Deaths as a result of RTA had been estimated at almost 1.2 million across the globe while associated injuries are estimated at 50 million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

However, the percentage frequency of diaphyseal humeral fractures as a result of falls was significantly higher (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) on the left side than on the right side. The dominance of non-dominant arm in distal humeral fractures had been associated with falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, the major causes of diaphyseal humeral fractures are RTA and falls. Since diaphyseal humeral fracture is an issue of harsh economic consequences, adequate measures should be taken by all the parties involved, especially government agencies, to address this menace in term of road maintenance and general well-being of the citizens. Furthermore, since it was observed that different regions of the bones of interest present diverse characteristics with respect to associated risk factors, it is recommended that such studies as this should be region-based rather than whole-bone based.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Availability of supporting data</title><p>The data set supporting the results of this article is available in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec9"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="41038_2015_7_MOESM1_ESM.csv" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
<bold>Raw data of some demographic risk factors associated with diaphyseal humeral fractures among Nigerians.</bold> Information that were gathered from the patients&#x02019; case notes included age, gender, affected side, and causes of the fractures. The causes were grouped into three: those that occurred as a result of falls, those occurred as a result of RTA, and those that occurred as a result of other causes (these included birth injuries, pathological, industrial machines, gunshot, and arm twisting). The subjects were grouped according to their ages into four groups: below 21&#x000a0;years, 21&#x02013;40 years, 41&#x02013;60 years, and above 60&#x000a0;years. These were analyzed and presented as bar charts in the result section.</p></caption></media></p></sec></app></app-group><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>VC conceived of the study, participated in its design and coordination and statistical analysis, and helped to draft the manuscript.

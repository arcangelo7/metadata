We hypothesized that a key underlying mechanism of HO might be injury-induced dysregulation of immune checkpoint proteins (ICs). We found that the earliest stages of HO are characterized by enhanced infiltration of polarized macrophages into sites of minor injuries in an animal model of HO. The non-specific immune suppressants, Rapamycin and Ebselen, prevented HO providing evidence of the central role of the immune responses. We examined the expression pattern of ICs and found that they are dysregulated in HO lesions. More importantly, loss of function of inhibitory ICs (including PD1, PD-L1, and CD152) markedly inhibited HO, whereas loss of function of stimulatory ICs (including CD40L and OX-40L) facilitated HO. These findings suggest that IC inhibitors may provide a therapeutic approach to prevent or limit the extent of HO.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Bone</kwd><kwd>Physiology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100005440</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Health &#x00026; Human Services | NIH | Center for Scientific Review (NIH Center for Scientific Review)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1 AR066539</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kessler</surname><given-names>John A.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Heterotopic ossification (HO),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> acquired or hereditary, is characterized by pathological bone formation outside of the normal skeleton, generally following tissue damage. For example, acquired HO (aHO), is commonly triggered by traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> total hip arthroplasty,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> wartime trauma, or other traumatic injuries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> Following the acute injury, these patients typically develop persistent low-grade inflammation, chronic pain, unhealed wounds, restricted joint movement, nerve entrapment, and diminished quality of life. Hereditary HO, such as fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> though rare, is much more devastating and life threatening. Notably, even though FOP is caused by gain-of-function mutation of the type 1 bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> ACVR1 (also known as ALK2), the initiation of the HO process in FOP is similarly triggered by abnormal immune responses to minor injuries (also called flare-up) followed by persistent low-grade inflammation.</p><p id="Par3">To model HO in mice, we created a transgenic line (Nse-BMP4) that overexpresses BMP4 under the control of the neuron-specific enolase (Nse) promoter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> Nse is an important glycolytic enzyme that is modulated by the cellular milieu in response to traumatic injury. In Nse-BMP4 mice, the Nse transgene is induced in macrophages (M&#x003d5;) by injury, and the HO that develops in Nse-BMP4 mice is restricted to the site of the injury. The injury-induced local overexpression of BMP4 becomes significant only 3 days post injury (see Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) indicating that upregulation of BMP signaling is not the initiating event in the subsequent signaling cascade that leads to HO.</p><p id="Par4">In previous studies, we found that both innate immune responses and adaptive immunity play key roles in the pathological process of HO.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> Similarly, recent studies have also shown that disrupted adaptive immune responses are closely associated with HO formation in mice following burn injury and Achilles tenotomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> The overall breadth and magnitude of immune responses are regulated by immune checkpoint proteins (ICs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> The mammalian genome encodes many different ICs with different expression patterns and functionalities, and some ICs stimulate immune responses to maintain immune homeostasis, whereas others are inhibitory.

We examined the infiltration of immune cells into sites of minor injury and the production of cytokines in Nse-BMP4 and wild-type (WT) mice and in uninjured controls at different time points post-injury (p.i.). Infiltration into the injury sites of M&#x003d5;/monocytes (F4/80), T cells (CD3), and B cells (CD45R) was examined by immunohistochemistry, and responses to the same injury differed significantly in Nse-BMP4 and WT mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, c</xref>). All tested immune cells were found in the HO lesions. The distribution patterns varied greatly for different subpopulations of cells at different time points, but M&#x003d5; were the predominant infiltrating immune cells throughout the entire HO process. We also measured the expression of inflammatory cytokines in the lesion sites using quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and found that all the tested cytokines were dysregulated.

Although the ICs had somewhat differing patterns of expression, in general the percentage of cells expressing stimulatory ICs was markedly increased in the early stages but decreased at later stages of HO. The time course of expression of inhibitory ICs was more variable with increases in some (TIM3 and PD1) inhibitory ICs occurring within the first week, whereas the percentage of cells expressing other inhibitory ICs was increased later during the HO process. Double staining with immune cell markers (F4/80) revealed that both stimulatory and inhibitory ICs were extensively co-expressed by F4/80+ M&#x003d5; (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) but only rarely in lymphocytes (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Immune checkpoint proteins are dynamically dysregulated in HO lesions. <bold>a</bold> Immunofluorescence staining showed the expression of CD28 and PD1 in WT mice at 1, 2 and 4 weeks p.i.

Typical three-dimensional (3D) reconstructed micro-computed tomographic (micro-CT) images shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> demonstrate that neutralizing Abs against stimulatory ICs (CD40 and CD134) actually facilitated HO, while neutralizing Abs against inhibitory ICs (PD1, PD-L1, and CD152) inhibited HO, partly in a dose-dependent (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) manner. Note that, in the studies shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> of Abs against inhibitory ICs, most mice in the experimental groups did not develop HO at 1 month. To determine whether the treatments only delayed the HO process, the experiment was extended to 2 months. For this reason, the micro-CT images in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref> were taken at 2 months p.i., instead of 1 month p.i.(Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>).

In view of the central role of M&#x003d5; in HO, we questioned whether they may alter the ECM during the HO process. Matrix metallopeptidase 12 (MMP12) and a metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 19 (Adamts19) are important ECM components involved in the breakdown of ECM. Expression by F4/80 M&#x003d5; of Adamts19 was reduced after injury in WT mice but MMP12 expression was significantly increased.

The predominant view in the field at present is that BMP receptor signaling, mediated by BMP2/4/6/7 and/or activin, initiates the effects of the traumatic insults that lead to HO. The hypothesis underlying our current studies, and our experimental findings, challenge this view. Although BMP receptor signaling clearly plays a central role in HO, we find that BMP signaling is a later rather than early part of the signaling cascade that culminates in HO. Among over a dozen BMP-overexpressing transgenic lines, the Nse-BMP4 line utilized in the current studies is the only one that recapitulates the hallmarks of both aHO and FOP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> This reflects the characteristics of the Nse promoter that drives the transgene construct. In Nse-BMP4 mice, the Nse transgene is induced in M&#x003d5; by injury, but the injury-induced expression of BMP4 does not become significant until 3 days p.i. (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). This suggests that increased BMP signaling is not the initiating event in Nse-BMP4 mice but rather a necessary factor for propagating the pathophysiologic process.</p><p id="Par13">Previous studies have shown that, unlike normal skeletogenesis, both innate and adaptive immunities contribute to HO.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> In particular, M&#x003d5; are both abundant and persistent in local HO lesions, and limiting the influx of monocytes/M&#x003d5; reduces or prevents experimental HO.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> This suggests an essential early role for M&#x003d5; in triggering HO. We found that both stimulatory and inhibitory ICs were expressed by M&#x003d5; in HO lesions. In general, the percentage of cells expressing stimulatory ICs was markedly increased in the early stages but decreased at later stages of HO, whereas the percentage of cells expressing inhibitory ICs was more variable with some increased earlier and some later during the HO process. Interfering with the expression of inhibitory ICs resulted in a truly remarkable reduction in HO with almost total prevention of HO even 2 months post-injury in the Nse-BMP4 mice. Conversely, interfering with the expression of stimulatory ICs markedly increased the severity of the HO. These observations highlight the central role of ICs in the altered immune homeostasis that leads to HO.</p><p id="Par14">The observation that immune suppressants such as Rapamycin and Ebselen suppress HO would seem to suggest that overactive immune responses are responsible for HO. However, the findings that loss of function of stimulatory ICs facilitated HO, whereas loss of function of inhibitory ICs inhibited HO would seem to suggest that depressed immune responses are responsible. What underlies these seemingly contradictory sets of observations? We found that the percentage of CD206+/F4/80+ M&#x003d5; in lesion sites increased progressively with time. In fact, &#x0003c;1% of the M&#x003d5; expressed CD206 at the time of injury while about 90% of the cells expressed CD206 within several weeks. Similarly, there was a conversion in the ICs expressed by the M&#x003d5; from stimulatory to inhibitory ones. This suggests a dynamic biphasic process, i.e., overactive early and depressed later immune responses that both are necessary preconditions for the subsequent HO. Thus blocking either phase may be sufficient to prevent HO.</p><p id="Par15">In earlier studies, we identified dysregulation of local stem/progenitor cells as a common cellular mechanism for HO,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and many subsequent studies have characterized both the lineage of the stem cells and the cellular and molecular components of the stem cell niche that presdisposes them to osteogenic differentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> Stem/progenitor cell differentiation is greatly influenced by the ECM in which the cells reside, and increased deposition of ECM proteins is a consistent feature of the early phases of HO.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> In view of the central role of M&#x003d5; in HO,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> we questioned whether they may alter the ECM during the HO process. We found that expression by F4/80 M&#x003d5; of both MMP12 and Adamts19 was reduced after injury in Nse-BMP4 mice, whereas MMP12 increased in WT mice, suggesting a possible mechanism for the increase in ECM proteins in the lesion.</p><p id="Par16">Although it is always difficult to extrapolate from animal models of disease to humans, the cellular and molecular features of human HO are very similar to what is observed in Nse-BMP4 mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> Thus we hypothesize that a BMP-dependent, injury-induced stem cell niche is a common mechanism of HO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> and that the altered immune homeostasis observed in the animal model are part of the process in humans. Importantly, we specifically used FDA-approved IC inhibitors in these studies to enhance the potential translational implications.

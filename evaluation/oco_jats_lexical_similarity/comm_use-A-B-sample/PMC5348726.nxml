Deficiency of <italic>Lrrk1</italic> in mice causes a severe osteopetrosis in the metaphysis of the long bones and vertebrae bones, which makes LRRK1 an attractive alternative drug target for the treatment of osteoporosis and other high-turnover bone diseases.

Bone loss occurs with age partly when the bone resorption rate is greater than the bone formation rate. Although bone resorption is coupled with bone formation during normal physiological conditions to maintain bone homeostasis, an increased number and/or function of osteoclasts are known to contribute to excessive bone loss during disease states and aging. The processes of bone formation and bone resorption are regulated by systemic hormones, nutrition, local growth factors, and mechanical stimuli.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> A high-throughput screen aimed at the identification of the functions of over 4&#x02009;500 genes led to the discovery of a leucine-rich repeat kinase 1 (LRRK1) as a critical regulator of osteoclast function and bone resorption with little effect on bone formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> The severe osteopetrosis phenotype in long and axial bones observed in <italic>Lrrk1</italic> knockout (KO) mice makes LRRK1 an ideal drug target for the prevention and treatment of osteoporotic fractures. This review summarizes recent advances on the functions of the Lrrk1-related family members, <italic>Lrrk1</italic> deficiency-induced skeletal phenotypes, LRRK1 structure&#x02013;functional, potential biological substrates and interacting proteins, and the mechanisms of LRRK1 action in osteoclasts.</p></sec><sec><title>LRRK1 family numbers</title><p>LRRK1 belongs to the ROCO family of proteins that are characterized by their unique domains including leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and/or ankyrin repeats (ANK), a GTPase-like domain of ras of complex proteins (ROC), a C terminus of Roc domain (COR) with an unknown function, a serine/threonine kinase domain that shares sequence similarity with MAPKKK (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase), and a series of WD40 repeats in their C termini.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5 bib6 bib7">5&#x02013;7</xref></sup> In humans, there are four ROCO proteins, including MFH-amplified sequences with leucine-rich tandem repeats (MASL1), death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1), LRRK1, and LRRK2. Although the ROCO family members seem to share similar structures and are ubiquitously expressed in all tissues, they do not have overlapping functions that can compensate for each other. The diverse functions of the ROCO proteins are predicted to be determined by their specific functional domains, tissue-specific expression, interacting proteins, and cross-talk with other signaling pathways in specific tissues or cell types.</p><sec><title>MASL1</title><p>MASL1, also known as malignant fibrous histiocytoma-amplified sequence 1, is the only ROCO protein lacking a kinase domain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7 bib8 bib9">7&#x02013;9</xref></sup> The full-length oMASL1 protein consists of 1&#x02009;053 amino acids and functions as an oncogene. The protein is overexpressed in malignant fibrous histiocytomas, gastric cancer, and hematologic malignancies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> The chimeric MASL1 protein formed from a chromosome translocation is associated leukemic mantle cell lymphoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup>
<italic>In vivo</italic> tumorigenesis assays in nude mice have demonstrated that both MASL1 and chimeric MASL1 possess tumorigenic activity, suggesting that MASL1 is an important oncogene that regulates solid tumor and hematologic malignant cell growth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> However, Kumkhaek <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> reported that MASL1 expression was significantly increased at both messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels during the erythroid differentiation of CD34<sup>+</sup> progenitor cells after erythropoietin stimulation, and the action was mediated via activating the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway. The issue of how MASL1 regulates the proliferation of tumor cells, but modulates the differentiation of CD34<sup>+</sup> progenitor cells, is unknown. Recently, a study proposed that MASL1 could first interact with heat-shock protein 60 (HSP60) to form a protein complex, then the complex could aggregate to become polymeric MASL1/HSP60 upon GDP binding to MASL1. The inactive polymeric MASL1/HSP60 complex could induce cell death. However, the polymeric MASL1/HSP60 could release active oligomeric MASL1/HSP60 upon GTP binding to MASL1. The active oligomeric MASL1/HSP60 complex stimulated cell proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> Thus, GTP/GDP binding to MASL1 functions as a molecular switch within the cell to regulate cell death versus proliferation.</p></sec><sec><title>DAPK1</title><p>DAPK1 contains a death domain on its C terminus and a kinase domain on its N terminus, but lacks the LRR repeats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> Examination of the DAPK1 kinase domain revealed that DAPK1 is a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase linked with the cytoskeleton and a mediator of apoptosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> Inhibition of DAPK1 expression suppressed apoptosis, whereas the overexpression of DAPK1 resulted in neuronal cell death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16 bib17 bib18">16&#x02013;18</xref></sup> Mice with disruption of DAPK1 exhibited reduced renal tubule and neuron apoptosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> Recent studies found that DAPK1 could be activated by various factors, such as cellular stress and growth signaling. In normal cells, DAPK1 can activate p53, leading to p53 target gene transcription and apoptosis under death-related signaling. Simultaneously, DAPK1 could regulate cell growth by modulating TSC1/TSC2 complex formation via the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> Phosphorylation of TSC2 at serine 939 by DAPK1 disrupts the dimerization of TSC1 with TSC2, leading to increased cell growth and protein synthesis, and thereby maintaining a homeostatic balance between survival and death signaling. In p53 mutant cells, however, DAPK1 could not activate the p53-mediated death signaling pathways, resulting in a shift of function from apoptosis toward activation of the growth pathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> Unlike other ROCO family members, GTP binding to the ROC domain of DAPK1 negatively regulates the kinase activity via inducing its inhibitory auto-phosphorylation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>LRRK2</title><p>LRRK2 is one of the most studied proteins among the ROCO family proteins. Mutations in <italic>Lrrk2</italic> have been associated with autosomal-dominant Parkinson&#x02019;s disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder with symptoms of resting tremor, postural instability, muscle rigidity, and bradykinesia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> The <italic>Lrrk2</italic> gene encodes a large multi-domain protein of 2&#x02009;527 amino acids. A mutation of G2019S in the kinase domain of LRRK2 has been shown to elevate its kinase activity, GTP binding, and contributed to PD, whereas other mutations identified in patients with PD had no effect on the kinase activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27 bib28 bib29 bib30 bib31">27&#x02013;31</xref></sup> Patients carrying the G2019S mutation showed neurodegeneration, including loss of dopaminergic neurons and accumulation of Lewy bodies in the cytoplasm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> Transgenic mice that overexpress the G2019S mutant LRRK2 also exhibited neuronal degeneration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> Greggio <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> found that a decrease in the kinase activity of LRRK2, either by synthetic mutations in the kinase domain or by abolishing GTP binding to LRRK2, relieved the toxicity resulting from pathogenic mutations. Mice lacking the LRRK2 protein showed an early-onset increase in number and size of secondary lysosomes in kidney cells and lamellar bodies in lung cells, whereas mice expressing the LRRK2 kinase-dead mutant from an endogenous locus displayed similar early-onset pathophysiological changes in the kidneys but not in the lungs. Tong <italic>et al</italic> reported that the loss of <italic>Lrrk2</italic> impaired protein degradation pathways, resulting in an accumulation of &#x003b1;-synuclein, and led to marked increases in apoptotic cell death, inflammatory responses, and oxidative damage in the kidneys, but not to neurodegeneration or neuropathological changes in the brain of aged mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup> Mutations in the ROC domain (K1347A and T1348N) of LRRK2 prevented GTP binding and reduced kinase activity as well.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> Interestingly, mice with the disruption of <italic>Lrrk2</italic> exhibited no obvious skeletal phenotypes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> The discrepant phenotypes among different LRRK2 mutant mice strongly suggested that other structural domains besides the kinase domain also function via forming scaffold complexes, GTP/GDP switches, or protein/protein interactions.</p></sec><sec><title>LRRK1</title><p>The human <italic>Lrrk1</italic> gene is located on chromosome 15 (15q26.3) and consists of 34 exons spanning a region of over 150&#x02009;kb.

<italic>Lrrk1</italic>was first identified as a mammalian growth regulatory factor in U2OS osteosarcoma cells, and the overexpression of <italic>Lrrk1</italic> in human HEK293 cells was found to induce cell proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup> However, loss of <italic>Lrrk1</italic> in mice caused severe osteopetrosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup>
<italic>Lrrk1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were born alive, with the expected Mendelian frequency at 2 weeks of age. The body length of the <italic>Lrrk1</italic> KO mice was slightly shorter compared to the wild-type (WT) control littermates at 4 weeks of age. Targeted disruption of <italic>Lrrk1</italic> resulted in the highest observed body volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) of the 3&#x02009;629 distinct gene KO lines examined by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) using high-throughput screening.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> The vBMD of <italic>Lrrk1</italic> KO mice was higher than <italic>Sost</italic> and <italic>c-Src</italic> KO mice. Both <italic>Lrrk1</italic> KO males and females have the same elevation in total BMD as compared to WT gender-matched littermate mice, and the increase in BMD in the long bones and spines of KO mice was persistent during aging. Micro computed tomography (micro-CT) analyses revealed that the trabecular bone volume was markedly increased in 8-week old, growing <italic>Lrrk1</italic> KO mice, as well as, in 79-week-old aging mice due to elevated trabecular number and trabecular thickness, and reduced trabecular separation. Interestingly, long bones had a wider metaphysis, normal diaphysis, but reduced marrow cavity area. Disruption of <italic>Lrrk1</italic> also resulted in slightly increased cortical bone thickness in the tibia and femur shaft in young as well as aging mice due to reduced endocortical resorption as total area (diameter) was unaffected and the marrow cavity area was reduced. In contrast to markedly elevated trabecular bone volume in long bones and vertebrae, our unpublished data showed that deficiency of <italic>Lrrk1</italic> had only a mild effect on the skull. The calvarias from <italic>Lrrk1</italic> KO mice had normal total volume (TV) but 20% higher BV and 17% higher BV/TV than control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In the mandible, TV, bone volume (BV), and BV/TV in <italic>Lrrk1</italic> KO mice were increased 25%, 34%, and 7%, respectively. The modest skull and mandible phenotypes of <italic>Lrrk1</italic> KO mice compared to the long bones and the vertebra are consistent with evidence that regulation of osteoclast function is different in membranous and endochondral bone, or that the osteoclast-mediated bone remodeling is less relevant in flat bones compared to long bones or vertebrae.</p><p>Histological analyses showed that there was extensive unresorbed cartilage below the growth plate of the distal femur and proximal tibia of <italic>Lrrk1</italic> KO mice, and numerous tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive osteoclasts with an increased trabecular number and trabecular bone volume. The primary spongiosa in the <italic>Lrrk1</italic> KO mice extended to the diaphysis and was characterized by increased mature osteoclasts, cartilage, and trabecular bone. The secondary spongiosa was very short and incomplete. The <italic>Lrrk1</italic> KO osteoclasts in bone contained increased amounts of pale eosinophilic cytoplasm with enlarged scattered nuclei. Histological examinations of teeth and surrounding bones at 79 weeks of age found that <italic>Lrrk1</italic> KO mice had normal incisors, molars, and periodontal ligaments. The turbinate bones were of normal thickness and contained prominent basophilic (reversal) lines. Consistent with the micro-CT analyses, there was modest osteosclerosis of the periodontal bone, nasal septum, and bridge of the nose. Analyses of serum chemistry values from <italic>Lrrk1</italic> KO and WT control littermates showed that TRAP5b, a marker of osteoclast number, was elevated both in young and older mice.</p><p>More recently, an autosomal recessive mutation of <italic>Lrrk1</italic> has been identified in a human patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> A partial DNA deletion in the <italic>Lrrk1</italic> gene caused a frame-shift mutation, resulting in the disruption of the 7th WD40 repeats, and addition of a 66-amino-acid sequence to the C terminus of the LRRK1 protein. The mutation caused a loss of LRRK1 function in osteoclasts. The clinical features of the patient were very similar to the skeletal phenotypes observed in the <italic>Lrrk1</italic> KO mice. The patient with a loss of function mutation had an osteosclerotic metaphyseal dysplasia, a distinctive form of osteopetrosis characterized by severe osteosclerosis confined to the metaphysis of the long and short tubular bones due to osteoclast dysfunction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> A skeletal survey showed a normal skull; the vertebral bodies were of normal height but had mild marginal sclerosis. The ribs were slightly broad. Marginal sclerosis of the ilia and broad, and sclerotic metaphyses of the proximal femur were noted. Hand radiographs showed broad, sclerotic metaphyses of the distal radius and ulna, and sclerotic metaphyses of the metacarpals and phalanges. The skeletal phenotypes in <italic>Lrrk1</italic> KO mice and the clinical skeletal signs in the affected patient with an <italic>Lrrk1</italic> gene mutation are summarized in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The human genetic studies together with the studies in the <italic>Lrrk1</italic> KO mouse model strongly suggest that LRRK1 plays a critical role in regulating osteoclast function and peak bone mass.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Lrrk1</italic> and <italic>Lrrk2</italic> expression</title><p>Drosophila and lower vertebrate organisms such as Fugu and Zebrafish have only a single <italic>Lrrk</italic> gene, whereas the mammalian genome contains both <italic>Lrrk1</italic> and <italic>Lrrk2</italic> genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> Biskup <italic>et al</italic> recently measured <italic>Lrrk1</italic> and <italic>Lrrk2</italic> mRNA in multiple organs in neonatal and adult mice, and found that expression levels of <italic>Lrrk1</italic> and <italic>Lrrk2</italic> mRNA were almost identical in the lung, heart, skeletal muscle, and lymph node.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></sup> However, <italic>Lrrk2</italic> mRNA is more abundant in kidney and brain tissue, whereas <italic>Lrrk1</italic> mRNA is more abundant in the stomach, liver, small intestine, thymus, and smooth muscle. Other studies indicated that <italic>Lrrk2</italic> mRNA is expressed in adult rat striatum, hippocampus, cerebral cortex, sensory and sympathetic ganglia, lung, spleen, and kidney.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> In the developing rat striatum, <italic>Lrrk2</italic> transcription is first observed at postnatal day 8, followed by increased levels of expression up to 3 weeks of age. The expression level then remains constant for nearly 2 years. The time course of postnatal development of <italic>Lrrk2</italic> expression patterns in the striatum thus closely mirrors the postnatal development of dopamine innervation of the striatum. <italic>Lrrk1</italic> is also found in most tissues of the postnatal day 1 rats. It is also known to be expressed in a number of adult rat tissues including brain, adrenal gland, liver, lung, spleen, and kidney. Interestingly, although both <italic>Lrrk1</italic> and <italic>Lrrk2</italic> are expressed in the adult human cortex cerebra, hippocampus, only <italic>Lrrk2</italic>, but not <italic>Lrrk1</italic>, is expressed in the striatum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref></sup> Strong expression of <italic>Lrrk2</italic> is mainly found in neurons, specifically in the dopamine receptor 1 (DRD1a) and 2 (DRD2)-positive subpopulations of the striatal medium spiny neurons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref></sup> More recently, <italic>Lrrk1</italic> expression is found to be low in murine osteoblasts and osteocytes, but its expression is significantly increased during the late stages of osteoclast differentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> These studies strongly suggest that the two paralogous family members may not have overlapping functions, although they have partly complementary expression patterns in the brain, as well as in certain peripheral organs including lymphatic tissues and bones. The differential expression patterns of <italic>Lrrk1</italic> and <italic>Lrrk2</italic> genes in specific cell types and developmental stages may explain in part why loss of <italic>Lrrk1</italic> exhibited skeletal phenotypes but not PD, and <italic>Lrrk2</italic> expression could not compensate for the loss of <italic>Lrrk1</italic> in bones.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Functional domains of Lrrk1 in osteoclasts</title><p>The large multi-domains of LRRK1 could function as an adapter, a kinase, or a GTPase-modulating protein of focal adhesion molecules in osteoclasts.

The predicted three-dimensional structure of the ANK repeat domain of human LRRK1 is similar to secondary structures of the typical ANK repeats and the Ankyrin repeat, SH3-domain, and proline-rich-region containing protein 2 (ASPP2, also known as 53BP2), which binds to p53 as a co-activator and regulates cell apoptosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref></sup> It contains functional motifs of &#x003b2;-hairpins, inner helices, and outer helices that can bind to important proteins involved in podosome assembly and disassembly in osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2a and b</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48 bib49 bib50">48&#x02013;50</xref></sup> Interestingly, the integrin-linked serine/threonine kinase (ILK) also contains four ANK repeats that bind to the LIM1 domain of PINCH isoforms and ILK-associated phosphatase at the N terminus, modulating ILK protein conformation, cellular localization, F-actin remodeling, and integrin signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51 bib52 bib53">51&#x02013;53</xref></sup> Inactivation of the ILK in osteoclasts in mice resulted in an increase in osteoclastogenesis both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, but ILK-deficient osteoclasts displayed a decrease in bone resorption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref></sup> More recent studies involving deletion mutants of <italic>Lrrk1</italic> revealed that bone resorptive defects were rescued by the overexpression of LRRK1 or LRR-truncated LRRK1 in <italic>Lrrk1</italic>-deficient osteoclasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref></sup> However, overexpression of ANK-truncated LRRK1 failed to rescue the bone resorption function of <italic>Lrrk1</italic>-null osteoclasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref></sup> These data are consistent with the prediction that the ANK domain is required for LRRK1 regulation of osteoclast function. In addition, the sequences of the kinase domains in LRRK1 and LRRK2 are quite different. As an ANK repeat is one of the most common protein&#x02013;protein interaction motifs, it is possible that the LRRK1 ANK repeats may mediate specific interactions of the kinase domain with its substrates such that LRRK1 has substrates that are distinct from that of LRRK2, and exercises its specific function in the bone.</p><p>Previous findings indicate that the K651A point mutation of the ROC region of LRRK1 prevents GTP binding, reduces enzymatic activity, and impairs osteoclast bone resorption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54 bib55 bib56">54&#x02013;56</xref></sup> Recent studies also revealed that WD40 repeats are critical for LRRK1 function in human bones, as well as in mouse osteoclasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref></sup> Although the function of the LRRK2 WD40 domain has been well studied, little is known about the function of a putative LRRK1 WD40.

Our previous studies showed that mice with disruption of Lrrk1 exhibited a severe osteopetrosis phenotype in the trabecular fraction of the metaphases of long bones and vertebrae, which form by endochondral bone formation. To address the question of whether a lack of LRRK1 also influences skeletal sites that mainly form through the intramembranous route, we analyzed calvarial and mandibular bones of 6-week-old male <italic>Lrrk1</italic> KO mice and control WT littermates (<italic>N</italic>=4 pairs) by micro-CT. In contrast to markedly elevated trabecular BV/TV in long bones and vertebrae that had two- to fivefold increases in bone volume and bone mineral density,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> deficiency of <italic>Lrrk1</italic> had only a mild effect on the skull. The calvarias from <italic>Lrrk1</italic> KO mice had normal TV but 20% higher BV and 17% higher BV/TV than control mice (<bold>a, b</bold>).

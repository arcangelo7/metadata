Recent work in a mouse model with a dyskerin mutation has implicated an increased DNA damage response as part of the cellular pathology, while mouse models with <italic>Terc</italic> and <italic>Tert</italic> mutations displayed a normal response. To clarify how these contradictory results might apply to DC pathology in humans, we studied the cellular phenotype in primary cells from DC patients of several genetic subtypes, focussing on T lymphocytes to remain close to the haematopoietic system. We observed novel cell cycle abnormalities in conjunction with impaired growth and an increase in apoptosis. Using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy we examined induction of the DNA damage proteins &#x003b3;-H2AX and 53BP1 and the cell cycle protein TP53 (p53). We found an increase in damage foci at telomeres in lymphocytes and an increase in the basal level of DNA damage in fibroblasts, but crucially no increased response to DNA damaging agents in either cell type. As the response to induced DNA damage was normal and levels of global DNA damage were inconsistent between cell types, DNA damage may contribute differently to the pathology in different tissues.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>DNA damage</kwd><kwd>dyskeratosis congenita</kwd><kwd>lymphocytes</kwd><kwd>telomeres</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is an inherited disorder characterized by muco-cutaneous abnormalities consistent with a premature ageing phenotype, bone marrow failure and a predisposition to cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Dokal, 2001</xref>). As well as serving as a model of ageing in humans it is also a model disease for telomere dysfunction as it is the first disease that is thought to be caused by premature telomere shortening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Calado &#x00026; Young, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Bessler <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). Seven genetic subtypes have been described, five of which have genetic lesions in components (dyskerin, TERC, TERT, NOP10 and NHP2) belonging to the telomerase holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Heiss <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Vulliamy <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Armanios <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Walne <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), which is responsible for maintaining telomere length in certain tissues, and one of which (TIN2) has a lesion in the telomere shelterin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Savage <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>), which is responsible for maintaining the structural integrity of the telomere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">de Lange, 2005</xref>).</p><p>While the disease was first thought to be due to defective ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Heiss <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Luzzatto &#x00026; Karadimitris, 1998</xref>) data published in the intervening years has heavily implicated premature telomere shortening as the primary cause of the pathology. Indeed DC patients, as a group, have very short telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Mitchell <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Alter <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>) and the clinical phenotype is consistent with premature loss of cells in tissues with high turnover such as the skin, gut and bone marrow.</p><p>Recent studies have suggested that cells with DC-relevant mutations have an increased DNA damage response that has previously been overlooked and that this may play an important role in disease pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Gu <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). However, the current DNA damage studies have been carried out only in a single cell type (fibroblasts) with much of the work having been done in mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Gu <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Vidal-Cardenas &#x00026; Greider, 2010</xref>). The only analysis of characterized DC patient cells was in a single family with a <italic>TERC</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Westin <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). We therefore wanted to determine how prominent this potential mechanism might be in DC pathophysiology.</p><p>In this study we analysed primary human tissue exclusively, with the aim of avoiding, wherever possible, artefacts from transformation or genetic modification and potential differences between human cells and animal models. We obtained cells from patients with mutations in the telomerase genes <italic>DKC1</italic> (the gene encoding dyskerin, a telomerase structural nucleoprotein), <italic>TERC</italic> (the telomerase RNA component) and <italic>TERT</italic> (the telomerase reverse transcriptase), which collectively constitute the majority of genetically characterized DC cases. As bone marrow failure is the cause of mortality in approximately 80% of DC cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Kirwan &#x00026; Dokal, 2009</xref>) we focussed the majority of our analyses on T lymphocytes as these are cells of the haematopoietic system. We also studied fibroblasts in order to compare our data with the published literature.</p><p>While our data confirm that cell growth and survival are impaired and that apoptosis is increased, we also uncovered novel cell cycle abnormalities with fewer DC cells in the dividing S and G<sub>2</sub> phases and more in the senescent/quiescent G<sub>0</sub> phase. Extensive analysis of the DNA damage response revealed increased basal levels of DNA damage in fibroblasts and increased damage at telomeres in lymphocytes but crucially, the response to freshly induced DNA damage was not increased. We therefore concluded that, while DNA damage is increased &#x02013; consistent with the accumulation of short or dysfunctional telomeres &#x02013; this is inconsistent between cell types and we found no evidence that increased response to induced DNA damage is responsible for the cellular or clinical phenotype.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Patient T lymphocyte acquisition and tissue culture</title><p>Blood samples were obtained from patients and unaffected control volunteers at Barts and The London Children's Hospital, London with informed, written consent and research ethics committee approval.

T lymphocytes were harvested from DC patients&#x02019; blood when they attended our clinic. On each occasion T lymphocytes were also acquired from a healthy donor and these were processed and analysed alongside the patient sample to provide paired controls. The purity of the isolated T lymphocytes was determined to be 98&#x000b7;0 &#x000b1; 1&#x000b7;4% by measuring CD3 expression using flow cytometry. The patients comprised five <italic>DKC1</italic>, six <italic>TERC</italic> and two <italic>TERT</italic> mutations. Several of the <italic>TERC</italic> mutations have previously been assayed for telomerase activity in an <italic>in vitro</italic> fibroblast line system using co-transfection of plasmids bearing <italic>TERT</italic> and <italic>TERC</italic> with the mutations in question and these results have been noted (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). There were nine males, four females and the mean age (years) of the group was 25 &#x000b1; 3 SE (standard error). Of the controls, 10 were male, three were female and the mean age was 37 &#x000b1; 3 SE. It was not possible to acquire an age- and sex-matched control each time a sample was acquired owing to the availability of suitable controls at the time of the clinic. The telomere length (expressed as &#x00394;tel) was determined in the peripheral blood of all but one of the DC patients and in every case telomeres were shorter than normal. Seven were below the first centile and a further four were below the tenth (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). All of the patients had one or more abnormal haematological value with the exceptions of patients D2 and D4. Of the 13 DC patients, nine had reduced haemoglobin levels, 10 had reduced platelet counts (and generally were severely affected) and six were lymphopenic.

The cells studied were all genetically unmanipulated, primary tissues and represented three genetic subtypes of the disease.</p><p>The majority of published work on DC in humans has suggested that an inability to maintain telomeres, either by a dysfunction in the telomerase enzyme or by structural or mechanistic dysfunction at the telomere itself, results in premature apoptosis or senescence. Indeed, the presence of a short telomere is labelled as DNA damage by the normal cellular response which includes the formation of &#x003b3;-H2AX- and 53BP1-containing foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">d'Adda di Fagagna <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). However, short telomeres have often not been determined as the primary cause of pathology in studies of mouse models of DC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">He <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Ruggero <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Mochizuki <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>), perhaps highlighting inherent differences in mouse and human cell biology.</p><p>Recent work in fibroblasts from both mouse models and human tissues has suggested that an increase in the DNA damage response may contribute to the disease pathology. This has been demonstrated in mouse embryonic fibroblasts with a <italic>Dkc1</italic> mutation by exposure to etoposide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Gu <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). In human fibroblasts with a <italic>TERC</italic> mutation increased DNA damage, similar to that observed in our fibroblasts, was suggested to activate TP53 and thereby sensitize the cells to reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Westin <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). By studying both fibroblasts and lymphocytes we have shown that an increase in global DNA damage is not a consistent feature of tissues from DC patients. Further, by assessing the level of DNA damage before and after exposure to etoposide we have demonstrated that the response to DNA damage is not elevated and may, in fact, be slightly lower in some DC cells. If cells were continually and excessively activating their DNA damage response then one would also expect an accumulation in the G<sub>2</sub>/M phase as cells that were in the process of growth and division and have accumulated damage foci run up against the G<sub>2</sub>/M checkpoint, a situation commonly observed in lymphocytes from Fanconi anaemia patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Dutrillaux <italic>et al</italic>, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Kubbies <italic>et al</italic>, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Seyschab <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>). Instead we observed a reduction in the S and G<sub>2</sub>/M phase populations and a concomitant increase in the G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> population consistent with cells containing short telomeres being unable to cycle out of G<sub>1</sub>.</p><p>The role of the DNA damage response in DC is not universally agreed upon. One study in <italic>Terc</italic> and <italic>Tert</italic> knockout mouse cells, contrary to other published reports of mouse <italic>Dkc1</italic> mutation, suggested that the number of DNA damage foci and the amount of DNA damage associated protein induction was the same as or lower than in normal mouse cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Vidal-Cardenas &#x00026; Greider, 2010</xref>). The effect on TP53 regulation is also unclear. While one study observed an increase in TP53 expression in mouse <italic>Dkc1</italic> mutant cells after etoposide exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Gu <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>), another reported a <italic>decrease</italic>, both in mouse cells and human B lymphocyte lines bearing dyskerin mutations, due to an impairment in internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-mediated TP53 translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bellodi <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). Looking back to much earlier work on the exposure of human DC lymphocytes and fibroblasts to clastogens, no significant difference was found compared to normal cells in terms of survival or chromosomal breakage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Dokal <italic>et al</italic>, 1992</xref>). If the DNA damage response were abnormally elevated in DC cells then this would affect survival after exposure to DNA damaging agents. However it remains at least possible that, because telomeres are already short in DC patients, the pre-existing disease context could potentially mask some of the effects that are observed in model systems.</p><p>Clearly, there is an abnormality in the basal level of DNA damage in the fibroblasts we studied and this is consistent with other published reports. This may well represent an accumulation of damage in cells that would be consistent with the accumulation of senescent fibroblasts with short or dysfunctional telomeres over time in culture. That we did not observe it in lymphocytes suggests that it is not a consistent feature of the disease across tissues. This is in contrast to Fanconi anaemia, in which chromosomal breakage is a consistent feature in both lymphocytes and fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Auerbach, 1993</xref>). The growth curves for T lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig 1A</xref>) demonstrate a rapid clearance of dead cells from culture, which may explain why such an accumulation does not occur with this cell type. On the other hand, we did observe a small but significant increase in the number of damage foci at telomeres in lymphocytes and again this is consistent with the presence of short or dysfunctional telomeres. Nonetheless, both cell types responded to etoposide exposure in a similar fashion to normal cells, suggesting that their DNA damage response machinery is intact.</p><p>While we contend that the role of DNA damage is secondary to telomere shortening in DC, we do not rule out the possibility that it contributes to pathology. Further to this, although features of increased DNA damage response are not displayed in the genetic subtypes of lymphocytes we have studied, additional work is necessary to clarify the situation in other subtypes. In particular, DC caused by mutations in the shelterin component TIN2 would be worthy of particular attention since expression of truncated forms of TIN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Kim <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>) and inactivation of another shelterin component TRF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Takai <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>) have been shown to result in the accumulation of &#x003b3;-H2AX-containing DNA damage foci at telomeres in cell lines. There are also the approximately 50% of genetically uncharacterized cases to consider, whose genetic and molecular mechanisms remain unknown.</p><p>Overall, our study points to short or dysfunctional telomeres as the primary cause of pathology in human cases of DC in the context of mutations in <italic>DKC1</italic>, <italic>TERC</italic> and <italic>TERT.</italic> While the accumulation of DNA damage may contribute to the pathology in some tissues, a dysfunctional DNA damage response is unlikely to play a primary role in the overall clinical phenotype in these individuals.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Work in our laboratory is supported by the Wellcome Trust.

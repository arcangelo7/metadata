Man's land' between congenital and valve surgeons, it largely remains
inadequately studied. We report our short-term results of treating it as a
'one and a half ventricle heart' and propose that the true tricuspid annulus
(TTA) 'Z' score be used as an objective criterion for estimation of
'functional' right ventricle (RV).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>22 consecutive patients undergoing surgery for Ebstein's anomaly were
studied. Echocardiography was performed to assess the type and severity of
the disease, tricuspid annular dimension and its 'Z' score. Patients were
operated by a modification of the cone repair, with addition of
annuloplasty, bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt (BCPS) and right reduction
atrioplasty to provide a comprehensive repair. TTA 'Z' score was correlated
later with postplication indexed residual RV volume.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was one (4.5%) early and no late postoperative death. There was a
significant reduction in tricuspid regurgitation grading (3.40&#x000b1;0.65
to 1.22&#x000b1;0.42, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). Residual RV volume
reduced to 71.96&#x000b1;3.8% of the expected volume and there was a
significant negative correlation (rho &#x02212;0.83) between TTA 'Z' score and
indexed residual RV volume. During the follow-up of 20.54&#x000b1;7.62
months, the functional class improved from 2.59&#x000b1;0.7 to
1.34&#x000b1;0.52 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In Ebstein's anomaly, a higher TTA 'Z' score correlates with a lower
postplication indexed residual RV volume. Hence, a complete trileaflet
repair with offloading of RV by BCPS (when the TTA 'Z' score is &#x0003e;2) is
recommended. The short-term outcomes of our technique are promising.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Ebstein Anomaly</kwd><kwd>Heart Defects, Congenital</kwd><kwd>Cardiovascular Surgical Procedures</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><table-wrap id="t4" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="10%" span="1"/><col width="90%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" style="background-color:#e6e7e8" rowspan="1">Abbreviations,

autopsy of a 19-year-old cyanotic man<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. The complex lesion was named Ebstein's anomaly and
included septal and posterior leaflet adherence to the underlying myocardium with
downward displacement of the functional tricuspid annulus, resulting in dilatation
of atrialized portion of right ventricle (RV) and true tricuspid annulus (TTA; the
right atrioventricular junction)<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. It is a rare congenital cardiac anomaly, occurring in
approximately 1 per 200,000 live births and accounting for &#x0003c;1% of all cases of
congenital heart disease<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. The complexity of the
anomaly led to several classifications being proposed, especially those proposed by
Carpentier et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>
and Celermajer et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. Various surgical techniques have been described for the
repair of this complex pathology, depending on the surgeon's understanding of
anatomical and functional alterations that involve the tricuspid valve, right
atrium, RV and conduction system<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>. Most of
the techniques involved repair in the leaflet and annular level with plication of
the atrialized RV either horizontally or vertically, resulting in a monocuspid or
bicuspid valve<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. We describe a standardized technique of a
physiologically and anatomically complete trileaflet repair of Ebstein's anomaly. In
view of the inevitable association of RV dysfunction with tricuspid deformity, a
comprehensive repair of all subcomponents of the anomaly has been practised at our
institute for a possible long-term event-free survival of these patients. It
includes: 1) Plication of the atrialized right ventricle; 2) Reduction of tricuspid
valve annulus resulting in neoannulus; 3) Trileaflet repair of tricuspid valve; 4)
Tricuspid ring annuloplasty; 5) Right atrial reduction &#x000b1; MAZE; 6)
Bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt (BCPS). To prove the need for BCPS shunt, we
measured the residual volume of RV after plication and correlated it with the
expected indexed RV volume.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>Between January 2012 to July 2016, 22 consecutive patients underwent surgery for
Ebstein's anomaly at the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, U.N. Mehta Institute
of Cardiology &#x00026; Research Centre, Ahmedabad.</p><sec><title>Preoperative Evaluation</title><p>Preoperative data including age, sex, previous cardiac surgery, cyanosis,
palpitations, dyspnea on exertion, pedal edema, hepatomegaly, presence of other
associated cardiac anomalies, arrhythmias, renal dysfunction, congestive cardiac
failure, need for ventilatory support, etc., were collected. Preoperative
echocardiography using Vivid i (GE Healthcare) was performed to evaluate the
severity and type of disease, degree of tricuspid regurgitation (TR), true
tricuspid annular dimension with 'Z' score, tricuspid annular plane systolic
excursion (TAPSE), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). The TTA was
measured in four chamber view as the maximal lateral diastolic distance at the
level of an echocardiographically identifiable annulus. If a patient had a
history of palpitations and/or the electrocardiogram showed arrhythmias, then
electrophysiological studies were performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Operative Procedure</title><p>Operation is performed via median sternotomy and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is
instituted with aortic, high superior vena cava and inferior vena cava
cannulation. Intraoperative transoesophageal echocardiography is routinely used.
Before initiating CPB, direct intraoperative pulmonary artery pressure is
measured to confirm the feasibility of Glenn shunt (mean pulmonary artery
pressure &#x0003c;15 mmHg). Moderate systemic hypothermia (32&#x000ba;C) and antegrade
cold blood cardioplegia are established. A standard oblique right atriotomy is
performed with an incision from the right atrial appendage (RAA) towards the
inferior vena cava, which is parallel to the right atrioventricular groove. The
left heart is vented via patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect. The
tricuspid valve anatomy is examined using valve hooks and the atrialized RV is
evaluated. Complete detachment and delamination of anterior tricuspid leaflet
(ATL) and posterior tricuspid leaflet (PTL) are performed preserving some
attachments to papillary muscles. The septal tricuspid leaflet (STL) is also
detached and delaminated to reach the true annulus by 'somersaulting' of STL
(releasing the lower margin of STL and flipping it over while intermittently
retaining the upper margin's attachment to the septal wall). During
delamination, as many chords as possible are retained after fenestration to be
cut at a later stage if they prevent rotation of the leaflets around the
annulus. Fenestrations present in ATL and PTL are closed using 6-0 polypropylene
suture. After delamination, atrialized RV is plicated in vertical fashion just
closer to the true annulus. A 75 ml, 26 Fr (Bard) Foley catheter is passed
across the tricuspid valve and the balloon is slowly inflated to measure the
right ventricular volume. Once measured, the balloon is deflated and the
catheter is retrieved. The true annulus is circumferentially plicated using two
5-0 polypropylene sutures to create a 'neoannulus', thus reducing the area of
tricuspid annulus to be covered by leaflet tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). The detached leaflets are then rotated clockwise and
attached to the neoannulus. Delamination of STL and somersault of STL will allow
less tension on the posterior leaflet when rotated clockwise and prevents a taut
PTL from creating a ledge in the TV&#x000b4;s inflow, which may give rise to gradients.
The pre-reduction of TTA to create a smaller neoannulus allows us to always have
adequate leaflet tissue to cover the tricuspid annulus, and we only rarely have
to increase the septal leaflet with autologous glutaraldehyde-fixed pericardium.
In any case, the trileaflet nature of the tricuspid valve is maintained as far
as possible. Tricuspid valve competence is tested and the prolapsing segments
are liberally supported by residual leaflet tissue or Gore-Tex neochordae
arising from papillary muscle head (to allow elongation during growth in
children). An appropriate size (usually 26 mm) of the 3D rigid ring (Medtronic)
is seated with 5-0 polypropylene interrupted, non-pledgeted sutures, to support
repair and to prevent late dilatation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure
2</xref>). The interatrial septum is closed. RAA is amputated and right
atrial reduction is performed to stream inferior vena cava flow towards the
tricuspid valve and avoid stasis of blood in right atrium, which can lead to
thrombus formation. BCPS is performed in the routine fashion. CPB is
discontinued. Inodilators (levosimendan/milrinone) and amiodarone infusion are
used to stabilize the patient in the immediate postoperative period and to
prevent and treat arrhythmias. All patients leave the operating room with a
central venous pressure monitoring line through femoral vein and superior vena
cava line to monitor Glenn pressure during the early postoperative period.
Patients are routinely extubated early (&#x0003c;6 hours). Inodilators are tapered
off one or two days after extubation. Postoperatively, patients are kept on
amiodarone, beta-blocker, diuretics and angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)
inhibitors. Anticoagulation for 3 months and amiodarone for 6 weeks are
continued postoperatively.</p><p>

postoperative arrhythmias were observed. Postoperatively and at discharge
echocardiographic TR was assessed by two independent operators and graded from 1
to 4. The highest grade was recorded as the TR degree. Follow-up was done at 1,
3 and 6 months postoperatively and 6 months later. At follow-up, New York Heart
Association (NYHA) class of all patients was recorded. Echocardiographic
evaluation was again performed by two independent operators for TR degree, TAPSE
and BCPS patency.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The statistical calculations were performed using SPSS software v 20.0 (Chicago,
IL, USA). Continuous and categorical data were expressed as mean &#x000b1; SD and
as proportions, respectively. The echocardiographic TTA 'Z' score preoperatively
calculated was correlated with the intraoperative residual RV volume (after
plication of the atrialized RV). The correlation between variables was
calculated using Spearman's correlation coefficient. The cutoff value of
<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 was considered for statistical significance.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>From January 2012 to July 2016, 22 patients underwent surgical correction of
Ebstein's anomaly. Median age was 12 years (ranging from 1.5 years to 27 years). Of
the 22 patients, there were 8 (36.4%) females and 14 (63.6%) males. Cyanosis was
present in 4 (18.2%) of the patients, however, almost all were desaturated with
SPO<sub>2</sub> around 90% (ranging from 50% to 94%). One (4.5%) of the patients
on presentation had supraventricular tachycardia, which was evaluated by
electrophysiological studies, but no aberrant pathway was found. The remaining
patients at the time of presentation were in sinus rhythm. Four (18.2%) patients had
associated ventricular septal defect, 18 patients had atrial septal defect/PFO and
one (4.5%) patient had associated left superior vena cava draining into the coronary
sinus. Echocardiographically, 4 (18.2%) patients were Carpentier type B, 17 (77.3%)
patients were type C and one (4.5%) was type D. Mean TTA was 49.86&#x000b1;7.4 mm
(ranging from 36 mm to 66 mm) with a mean 'Z' score of 3.72&#x000b1;0.57 (ranging

months (ranging from 10 to 36 months). There has been no late death to date. One
(4.54%) patient needed reoperation for worsening NYHA class and increasing grade of
tricuspid incompetence with dilatation of tricuspid annulus. This was a 1.5-year-old
child who was operated according to our technique, except for non-placement of a
tricuspid annuloplasty ring (the smallest annuloplasty ring of 26 mm was too large
for him). Finally, the child underwent the Starnes procedure followed by
extracardiac Fontan procedure. At the last follow-up, all patients were in NYHA
class I or II. The functional class (NYHA) and TR grade had improved significantly
(from 2.59&#x000b1;0.7 preoperatively to 1.34&#x000b1;0.52 and 3.40&#x000b1;0.65

</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In normal hearts, the septal and posterior leaflets are displaced downward in
relation to the anterior mitral valve leaflet, but displacement is less than 8
mm/m<sup>2</sup><sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. In Ebstein's anomaly, the displacement of the septal
and posterior leaflets (&#x0003e; 8 mm/m<sup>2</sup>) ranges from very minimal to severe.
This displacement effectively divides the ventricle into two regions, a part
proximal to it that is functionally integrated with the right atrium and a part
distal to it that is the effectively functional right ventricle.</p><p>Several studies have described natural history of Ebstein's anomaly<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>.
Celermajer et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>
found in their study that the actuarial survival rate was 67% at 1 year and 59% at
10 years. In childhood, adolescence and adult life, there was a continuous attrition
related to hemodynamic deterioration and sudden and unexpected death. Even those who
had an incidentally detected murmur had a small, but continuous, hazard for late
death<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.
Hence, patients with Ebstein's anomaly require early surgery. The worst subset of
patients presents earlier (<italic>i.e.</italic> infancy) and may more often
Carpentier classification type D, compared to older children. Of all neonates with
the diagnosis of Ebstein's anomaly, 20% to 40% did not survive 1 month, and &#x0003c;50%
survive to 5 years<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Carpentier et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>
and Celemajer et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> described the disease based on anatomical severity.
However, although Carpentier classification<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> describes anatomy well, it is not really
prognostic, while the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> is prognostic, but very
difficult to calculate. In Ebstein's anomaly, there is a disproportionate dilatation
of atrialized RV with marked dilatation of the true tricuspid valve annulus (right
atrioventricular junction)<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. The more severe the displacement of the septal
tricuspid valve leaflet, more is the atrialized right ventricle, which further
dilates and leads to dilatation of the true tricuspid valve annulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>). The true tricuspid annulus, although
dilated and poorly defined, is not displaced and hence can be easily measured
echocardiographically. We measured the intraoperative postplication indexed residual
right ventricular volume and correlated it with the TTA 'Z' score. There is a
significant negative correlation between the TTA 'Z' score and the postplication
indexed residual right ventricular volume, with a correlation coefficient of &#x02212;0.83.
This means that, as TTA 'Z' score increases, the indexed postplication RV volume
reduces significantly. Therefore, a high 'Z' score correlates with higher
displacement, which results in a more aneurysmal dilatation of RV inferior wall
(<italic>i.e.</italic> higher Carpentier type). Thus, we propose the measurement
of this TTA by echocardiography as a surrogate marker for the severity of Ebstein's
anomaly and suggest that its measurement be used as a guide to decide to add a BCPS.
The TTA 'Z' score can be taken as a management tool for the patient with Ebstein's
anomaly. TTA 'Z' scores &#x02265;4 indicate an excessively dilated tricuspid annulus
(and, by default, right ventricle). It is unlikely that this RV will be able to meet
a complete cardiac output for long and will continue to dilate unless preload is
reduced with a BCPS in addition to the tricuspid valve repair. For TTA 'Z' score of
+2 to +4, we recommend the addition of BCPS, especially for patients with Carpentier
type C and D for a long-term volume reduction and a potential RV reverse
remodelling<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>. Tricuspid valve with a TTA 'Z' score &#x02264;2
represents the 'forme fruste' of Ebstein's anomaly and does not need a BCPS if
tricuspid valve repair is being done. The addition of BCPS is further supported by
our observations: 1) after plication, the residual volume of RV is approximately 70%
of the indexed RV volume expected; 2) The plication of the atrialized RV will lead
to splinting effect on the inferior RV wall, which will not contribute to the RV
ejection; 3) A dilated cardiomyopathic residual RV will not be functioning
normally.</p><p>

</p><p>Malhotra et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>
described cyanosis as the preoperative criterion to decide to add BCPS, otherwise,
this decision was made intraoperatively after coming off bypass. However, we felt
that an addition of BCPS should be an elective rather than a salvage decision. The
moment the BCPS is salvaging the heart and repairing it, it means that the repair
was reactive rather than proactive. In addition, it means that the heart already
dilated too much to reverse remodel very well, even with preload reduction. Reverse
remodelling of the heart is possible with a prophylactic BCPS when myocardial muscle
fibres were not stretched beyond their maximum sarcomere length because at that
stage myocardial fibres are no longer contractile and act like any other connective
tissue fiber.</p><p>In our series, bidirectional Glenn was performed in 20 (90.9%) patients. The
remaining two patients were Carpentier type B, with TTA 'Z' score of 2.2 and 2.1,
requiring very minimal plication of the atrialized RV. Their postplication RV volume
was 81% and 84% of the expected indexed RV volume. Therefore, BCPS was not
performed. We observed that patients with type B generally have less displacement,
leading to less atrialized RV and required less plication. Thus, BCPS should not be
routinely performed in patients with type B class with a Z score of +2. We also
observed that, after plication of the atrialized RV, indexed residual RV volume in
our series was much lower than the expected indexed RV volume described in the
literature<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>. This is another reason why we started BCPS when
residual RV volume is less than 80% than expected.</p><p>In recent years, many authors have published successful management of Ebstein's
anomaly using biventricular approaches<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>. In our
series, the residual RV after plication of ARV was 70% of the expected indexed RV
volume, which precludes a biventricular repair. Lange et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> have not added a BCPS to
their repair, probably because of a different subset of patients in their series, as
their postoperative RV end diastolic volume was close to normal. However, they left
an interatrial communication of 5-6 mm in their patients, which would act as a
trigger to decompress a failing RV. BCPS proposes to prevent precisely that,
<italic>i.e</italic>., development of RV failure. Chauvaud et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> had
36% BCPS in their series, since their patient spectrum was much like ours.</p><p>Reduction in the functional RV load will have a significant effect on tricuspid
valvular function<sup>[<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>-<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup>. A bidirectional
cavopulmonary anastomosis will decrease the volume load on the already compromised
right ventricular geometry in Ebstein's anomaly. Additionally, bidirectional
cavopulmonary anastomosis will reduce transtricuspid valve flow and a more
aggressive tricuspid annuloplasty may be performed, if required, in order to reduce
TR to a minimum. Some series have, in fact, demonstrated that reduction of right
ventricular preload alone may be sufficient to reduce TR to the point where no
tricuspid valve intervention is required and maximum native valve structure can be
preserved<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>One of the major concerns in performing a bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis is
the effect of elevated pressure and pulsatility in the superior vena cava. However,
in our study, facial swelling and upper limb edema was noticed in only one (4.54%)
case in the postoperative period, which was also resolved on the 5<sup>th</sup>
postoperative day. Some authors also reported abnormal AV fistulas due to
BCPS<sup>[<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> in
their series, but we have not observed this complication.</p><p>Another concern of Ebstein's anomaly is the presence of a dilated atrialized right
ventricle, which is a result of right ventricular cardiomyopathy<sup>[<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup>. In advanced cases, this
dilated RV may cause bulging of ventricular septum leftward and cause compression of
the left ventricular chamber<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Hence, plication of the atrialized RV during surgery
will provide several advantages: 1) Reduction of non-functional portion of the right
ventricle; 2) Better blood flow dynamics in right ventricle; 3) Reduction of left
ventricular compression, thereby improving left ventricular function; 4) Elevating
the papillary muscles, which facilitates the closure of the anterior leaflet against
the septum in systole.</p><p>The one and a half ventricle repair for hypoplastic right heart is increasingly
gaining a prominent role in the management of complex congenital heart
diseases<sup>[<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup>. The Ebstein's
malformation is one of the most suitable lesions to which this concept may be
applied, especially because the pulmonary artery pressure in Ebstein's anomaly is
never high. However, poor LVEF, mean PA pressure &#x0003e;20 mmHg, PVR of &#x0003e; 4 Wood
units, LVEDP &#x0003e;12 mmHg preclude one and a half ventricle repair, as already
mentioned by other authors<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In Ebstein's anomaly, as the STL is displaced downwards, there is a discontinuity of
central fibrous body and septal atrioventricular ring, which results in direct
muscular connections between atria and ventricles. These may result in
pre-excitation<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup>. More than one accessory
pathway is found in 6% to 36% of cases. Most of these accessory pathways are
situated around the malformed tricuspid valve<sup>[<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>-<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup>.
Antegrade and retrograde conduction through these fast conducting atrioventricular
accessory pathways result in arrhythmias such as paroxysmal tachyarrhythmias, wide
QRS tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia or flutter, atrial fibrillation or atrial
flutter<sup>[<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup>. In our study, only one
(4.5%) patient had supraventricular tachycardia. Although preoperative
electrophysiologic studies did not reveal any accessory pathways in this patient, in
the postoperative period, the patient recovered in sinus rhythm and did not have any
episodes of SVT during follow-up. None of our patients demonstrated arrhythmias in
the postoperative period. We presume that the plication of the true dilated
tricuspid annulus and the dilated atrialized right ventricle, along with
circumferential reattachment of disconnected ATL and PTL to the neoannulus, may
interrupt some of these accessory pathways, which may help reduce the incidence of
postoperative arrhythmias. In addition, RAA amputation and right atrial reduction
would prevent arrhythmias originating from RAA due to right atrial dilatation.</p><p>In patients with Ebstein's anomaly, permanent postoperative pacing may be required in
3.7% of the cases<sup>[<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup>, most commonly for atrioventricular block and rarely
for sinus node dysfunction. In our study, one (4.5%) patient needed a permanent
postoperative pacemaker for complete heart block. The concern in performing BCPS is
the lost access through superior vena cava for transvenous endocardial lead
placement.</p><sec><title>Limitation</title><p>Our study limitation is the small number of patients, the lack of a control group
and the short follow-up period. In addition, the long-term complications of
bidirectional Glenn have to be keep in mind. Our use of the Foley catheter to
measure RV volume may incur an error of approximately 10% in measurement. As
other authors<sup>[<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup> have produced good
results with biventricular repair, our strategy has to stand the test of time.
Magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of these patients during follow-up over a
longer period could be more informative.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Ebstein's anomaly is a right ventricular cardiomyopathy and truly a one and a half
ventricle heart. A higher TTA 'Z' score correlates with a higher Carpentier class
and lower functional RV volume. These patients always do better with complete
trileaflet tricuspid repair and offloading of RV with BCPS. TTA 'Z' score &#x02265;4,
irrespective of the Carpentier type, should always require a BCPS, while Carpentier
types C and D with TTA 'Z' score between +2 to +4 should also be considered for a
BCPS (<xref rid="t3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Comprehensive repair is
mandatory in specified subsets and provides good results. The short-term outcomes of

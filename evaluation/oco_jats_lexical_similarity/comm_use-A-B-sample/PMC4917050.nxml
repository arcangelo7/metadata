Individuals who reported symptoms at baseline that were still present at the 3-month follow-up (<italic>n</italic> = 271), and who had also consented to be contacted (<italic>n</italic> = 215), constituted the pool of people invited for interview. Analyses focused on accounts of worrying about wasting GP time.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Participants were worried about wasting GP time when time constraints were visible, while dismissive interactions with their GP induced a worry of unnecessary help-seeking. Many felt that symptoms that were not persistent, worsening, or life-threatening did not warrant GP attention. Additionally, patients considered it time-wasting when they perceived attention from nurses or pharmacists to be sufficient, or when appointment structures (for example, &#x02018;one issue per visit&#x02019;) were not adhered to. Close relationships with GPs eased worries about time-wasting, while some patients saw GPs as fulfilling a service financed by taxpayers.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Worrying about wasting GP time is a complex barrier to help-seeking. GP time and resource scarcity, symptom gravity, appointment etiquette, and previous GP interactions contribute to increasing worries. Friendly GP relationships, economic reasoning, and a focus on the GP&#x02019;s responsibilities as a medical professional reduce this worry.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>diagnosis</kwd><kwd>help-seeking behaviour</kwd><kwd>neoplasms</kwd><kwd>primary health care</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>International comparisons show that 1-year cancer survival rates are worse in the UK compared with countries with similar healthcare systems.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Previous patient experience,<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and the perception of &#x02018;warranting&#x02019; medical attention, can lead to delays in help-seeking.<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Warranting medical attention may be influenced by several factors, including the type of symptoms,<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> awareness of the significance of the symptoms,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> perception of personal risk of cancer,<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and psychological, social, and physical barriers to health care.<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>In several qualitative investigations, patients mentioned the worry of &#x02018;wasting their GP&#x02019;s time&#x02019; as a psychological barrier to help-seeking for symptoms indicative of various cancers.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In a recent study, 15% of responders stated that worry about wasting their doctor&#x02019;s time was an anticipated barrier to healthcare seeking.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> A qualitative synthesis showed that fear of being labelled a time-waster was a barrier to seeking help for possible cancer symptoms,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> which was also associated with longer anticipated help-seeking intervals.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In some cases, receiving a benign diagnosis after symptomatic presentation can reinforce the fear of being a time-waster.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>The worry of wasting GP time reflects the discourse surrounding GP time scarcity and pressures. This perception of time-constrained doctors is enhanced by long waiting times and an apparent shortage of appointments,<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> which may lead patients to present symptoms at a later stage, once they are confident that they are eligible for medical attention. Patients who seek help quickly have few reservations about using doctors&#x02019; time, and believe that doctors could offer reassurance,<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> symptom alleviation, or a referral to specialist care.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Informing patients of the costs of their NHS appointments or requesting a fee for visiting their GP are some of the political discussions portrayed by the media.<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Importantly, not understanding the underlying mechanisms that feed into the worry of wasting a GP&#x02019;s time may lead to adverse effects of such media portrayal. For example, instead of increasing awareness of GP time scarcity in individuals who go to the GP unnecessarily, it may increase worry about GP time in those who are already concerned.</p><p>Although &#x02018;wasting GP time&#x02019; is often referred to as a potent factor leading to delay in symptom presentation, this psychological barrier has not been explored in depth with people in the community experiencing cancer alarm symptoms. The aim of the present study was to examine the different meanings given to the concept of wasting GP time, by deconstructing the decision-making process that leads individuals to feel that they are wasting, or are not wasting, their GP&#x02019;s time.</p></sec><sec><title>METHOD</title><p>A detailed description of the study methods, including a recruitment flow chart, has been published previously;<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> a brief summary is provided here.</p><boxed-text position="float"><sec><title>How this fits in</title><p>Worrying about wasting GP time is a commonly cited barrier to medical help-seeking in population-based surveys, and contributes to longer time-to-symptom presentation. However, there has been very little qualitative work on the concept of wasting GP time. One qualitative study with people reporting cancer &#x02018;alarm&#x02019; symptoms highlighted the perceived importance of limiting demands on GPs, but did not explore the concept in detail. This is the first qualitative study to explore what people experiencing cancer symptoms mean by &#x02018;wasting their GP&#x02019;s time&#x02019;. The findings highlight potential avenues to mitigate against this help-seeking barrier and encourage prompt symptomatic presentation.</p></sec></boxed-text><sec><title>Participant selection and recruitment</title><p>Participants were recruited from responders (<italic>n</italic> = 2042) to a large prospective postal survey conducted through four GP practices in England, which had been posted to 4913 individuals aged &#x02265;50 years in October 2013. Responders reporting at least one cancer alarm symptom (<italic>n</italic> = 936/2042; 46%), and who had agreed to be contacted again (<italic>n</italic> = 602/936; 64%), were sent a follow-up survey after 3 months to capture symptom experiences over time; 75% of people (450/602) returned the survey. Inclusion criteria for the in-depth interviews were: experience of at least one of 14 &#x02018;alarm&#x02019; symptoms at the 3-month follow-up (271/450; 60%), and consent to be contacted for interview (215/271; 79%). Of the 215 responders meeting the inclusion criteria, 144 were consequently invited to interview, with a response rate of 60% (86/144). Invitees were purposively sampled based on sex, age, and geographic area of residence.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Interviews ceased once data saturation was achieved (<italic>n</italic> = 62).</p></sec><sec><title>Interviews</title><p>Interview data were collected from people reporting ongoing cancer &#x02018;alarm&#x02019; symptoms. After the initial narrative account, a semi-structured topic guide was used to ensure topics such as help-seeking and psychological barriers (wasting GP time) were explored. Prompts were used to initiate responses to the &#x02018;wasting GP time&#x02019; component if it did not arise spontaneously. Participants were asked to tell whether they had had similar experiences to other interviewees; for example, &#x02018;<italic>Some people mentioned that they avoid or delay seeing the GP because they worry about wasting the doctor&#x02019;s time or bothering the doctor. Does this ever apply to you?</italic>&#x02019; Interviews lasted on average 42 minutes (range: 22&#x02013;66 minutes).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Analysis</title><p>Demographic and basic frequency information was analysed using SPSS version 21.0. Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. Two of the authors read and reread the transcripts and allocated arising themes to the two following questions: &#x02018;<italic>When do people feel as though they are wasting GP time?</italic>&#x02019; and &#x02018;<italic>What are the accounts of people who use GP services freely?</italic>&#x02019; Transcripts were coded using NVivo 9.0 software, and the emerging themes were managed in Microsoft Excel.

Understanding how the worry of wasting GP time influences the appraisal process and help-seeking decisions is crucial to improving early symptomatic presentation.</p><p>Symptom characteristics strongly influenced whether participants felt they would waste their GP&#x02019;s time or not. However, awareness of time and resource constraints by the GP and the NHS also influenced patients&#x02019; perception of wasting their GP&#x02019;s time. An awareness of long waiting times and difficulty making appointments led participants to report an increased worry over wasting their GP&#x02019;s time. Participants felt that the longer the waiting times for appointments, the more serious the symptom(s) needed to be. This reasoning offers novel insight into how various components that contribute to the worry of wasting GP time interact with each other. Resource constraints also led to a heightened awareness of what the GP may think of patients for seeking help for particular symptoms. Some participants had concrete ideas of what the GP may think or feel about them despite acknowledging that they did not actually know.</p><p>Importantly, this study also investigated the accounts of those who use GP services freely. These individuals felt that due to the taxes they had paid, they were entitled to use the service with moderation and had a general belief that the GP&#x02019;s responsibility was to help those in need and that GPs generally cared about their patients. They also recounted how a good relationship with their GP reduced their worry of wasting their GP&#x02019;s time.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This study builds on a growing body of research investigating influences on the patient interval (time from noticing a bodily change to seeking medical help),<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> to support individuals to seek medical advice as soon as possible &#x02014; a key element of the UK government&#x02019;s strategy for cancer,<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and the Independent Cancer Taskforce report.<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> This study offers novel and more detailed insights into the complexities underlying &#x02018;wasting GP time&#x02019; as a barrier to help-seeking. By interviewing people with ongoing cancer symptoms, but without mentioning cancer, the possible bias introduced in retrospective studies with cancer patients was reduced.<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The prospective nature of the present study also meant participants had experienced symptoms for at least 3 months before they were interviewed, reducing the possibility that symptoms were short-lived or transient.</p><p>The sample was drawn from London, and South East and North West England, which limits generalisability to other regions. It was also beyond the study&#x02019;s scope to examine the effect of specific symptoms on patients&#x02019; worry of wasting their GP&#x02019;s time. Investigating patients with more homogeneous symptom groups represents an area for future research; it could provide a more detailed picture and offer a powerful focus for intervention. Another outstanding question is how to balance minimising worry about wasting GP time in those who perceive it as a barrier, rather than readily encouraging all people to contact their GP more often for advice. The study also focused on older men and women (aged &#x02265;50 years) because of their higher risk of developing cancer.<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> However, certain demographic subgroups may be more likely to report worry about wasting their doctor&#x02019;s time, which could be a consideration for future research. For example, in a Danish study, a younger age group (30&#x02013;49-year-olds) were more likely to report worry about wasting their doctor&#x02019;s time than older age groups.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Finally, GPs were not interviewed and patient&#x02013;GP interactions were not observed; thus, the GP perspective is notably absent in this account. Future research could interview patient&#x02013;GP dyads to further explore how interactions may influence help-seeking.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with existing literature</title><p>Wasting GP time is a barrier to help-seeking frequently mentioned by individuals experiencing cancer &#x02018;alarm&#x02019; symptoms.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> As observed in the existing research, participants in the present study felt that, until the symptoms display a certain gravity or until they could categorise them as life-threatening, help-seeking would be seen by themselves and others as wasting their GP&#x02019;s time.<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Participants sought to protect their self-identity from being labelled a hypochondriac or &#x02018;time-waster&#x02019; by avoiding help-seeking for symptoms that could be benign, and for symptoms following an &#x02018;all-clear&#x02019; diagnosis,<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> using health care only when they felt it was absolutely necessary.

For practising clinicians, this study highlights areas where they might encourage appropriate help-seeking (for example, providing a safeguard for people reporting vague, non-specific symptoms by making follow-up appointments on behalf of patients). Future studies that capture the discourse of seeking help with GPs and alternative healthcare providers, such as nurse practitioners, in a more in-depth way could offer valuable insight into this promising target for intervention. Focusing on nurse practitioners as a point of contact for symptoms that may not fulfil the subjective requirements for GP attention may not only reduce the barrier represented by &#x02018;worrying about wasting GP time&#x02019;, but may also help to distribute demands on GPs&#x02019; time and resources.</p><p>An interesting area for future research would be to find out more about cognitive and affective constructs surrounding &#x02018;hypothetical others&#x02019;, and what part the media play in informing these constructs.</p><p>This study on adults reporting cancer &#x02018;alarm&#x02019; symptoms highlighted that the worry over wasting GP time was influenced by cognitive aspects (symptom characteristics and financial contributions to the NHS, GP responsibilities, in-appointment conduct) and emotive aspects (needs of hypothetical others, relationship with GP). Research is needed on how these attitudinal and emotive factors could be addressed in public health campaigns aimed at reducing time to presentation and improving earlier diagnosis of cancer.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>In memory of Professor Jane Wardle (1950&#x02013;2015).</p></ack><notes><sec><title>Funding</title><p>These analyses were carried out with funding from the Department of Health Policy Research Unit in Cancer Awareness, Screening, and Early Diagnosis, which receives funding for a research programme from the Department of Health Policy Research Programme.</p><p>It is a collaboration between researchers from seven institutions (Queen Mary University of London, University College London, King&#x02019;s College London, London School of Hygiene &#x00026; Tropical Medicine, Hull York Medical School, Durham University, and Peninsula Medical School).

million mark over the total number of scientific articles published since 1665, and
approximately 2.5 million new scientific articles are published each year.</p><p>No doubt many of these articles will be ignored and others, depending on where they
are published, will reach a wider audience. However, how can we be sure that the
article produced with such care, which holds relevant scientific importance, will
not be ignored? Moreover, which journals are able to reach your target audience?</p><p>One of the tools capable of predicting this and translating this subjective concept
into a mathematical number is the impact factor<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. The
impact factor is the measure of how often a article article was cited in a given
year. The more we read the article, the more likely it is to be quoted and the
greater its impact factor.</p><p>Thus, last June the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) released the list of impact
factors of scientific journals from around the world. Moreover, this year, the
Brazilian Journal of Cardiovascular Surgery (BJCVS) has hit the world, reaching the
impact factor of 0.805.</p><p>This was the first year that the BJCVS, previously denominated Brazilian Journal of
Cardiovascular Surgery, was cataloged with this denomination and, to the everyone's
surprise, even with this critical obstacle, the BJCVS for the second consecutive
year raised its index, and with an increase of more than 25% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>

</p><p>The JCR also provides a division of citations according to the countries and
institutions of origin of this citation; these data confirm the broad and
international spectrum of readers that the BJCVS has attained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>

</p><p>This achievement reflects, above all, the dedication of a compromised editorial board
that not only dedicates itself to selecting the best manuscripts, but also attempts
to contribute to their improvement.</p><p>Good results like these only reinforce the journal's commitment to the dissemination
of scientific production of merit and open doors to increasingly significant
contributions.</p></sec><sec><title>Is the Cardiopulmonary Bypass Systemic Inflammatory Response a Major
Concern?</title><p>The first successful open-heart operation using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was done
by John Gibbon on May 6, 1953. The operation was the closure of an atrial septal
defect. For a brief period (1955-1956), there were only two hospitals in the world
where open heart surgery was being done on a daily basis: C. Walton Lillehei at the
University of Minnesota and, 60 miles away, John Kirklin at the Mayo Clinic. From
the systematized experience of these two institutions, began the era of modern
open-heart surgery, followed by the evolution of the quality of CPB circuit
components whose excellence, of course, was associated with considerable morbidity
and mortality improvement. Then came the paradigm of the systemic inflammatory
reaction triggered by the contact of the blood with the non-endothelial surface of
the system, which is the main motivational aspect of this editorial.</p><p>The physiopathology of the CPB systemic inflammatory response is multifactorial, with
no final consensus about its actual mechanism. It can be divided into two main
phases: "early" and "late". The early phase occurs as a result of blood contact with
non-endothelial surfaces ("contact activation"), and the late phase is driven by
ischemia-reperfusion injury (I/R injury), endotoxemia, coagulation disorders, and
reactions to heparin/protamine. The contact of blood with a non-physiological
surface during CPB surgery is thought to induce a systemic inflammatory reaction
syndrome (SIRS). CPB plastic components and the CPB procedures, per se, are thought
to trigger the inflammatory response (early phase). This phase should occur in all
patients undergoing cardiac surgery and, due to the disproportion of their severity
with the number of surgeries performed worldwide, should not be the main cause of
vasoplegic syndrome, characterized by systemic inflammatory reaction.</p><p>Today, this paradigm is strongly debated, mainly because an inflammatory response is
still present in patients undergoing off-pump surgery. Also, O'Brien et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>
reported that transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) (which reduces surgical
trauma and avoids the need for CPB) does not attenuate the patients' innate
inflammatory response. Many studies have shown that blood contact with the surgical
wound may handle the inflammatory reaction (late phase). This hypothesis proposes
that blood coming into contact with serous membranes (pleura and pericardium) causes
fibrinolytic activity and increases bleeding, which agrees with recent advances in
our knowledge and understanding about the association between coagulation and
inflammation. As coagulation management during CPB is one of the most serious
problems, it is possible that inadequate heparin use could handle inappropriate,
imperceptible anticoagulation and therefore also trigger
inflammation<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. Thus, maintenance of
pleural integrity in the dissection of internal thoracic arteries should be an
interesting detail of the surgical technique.</p><p>Based on the literature overview and the worldwide cardiac surgery excellence, it
seems possible that pathological inflammation during human CPB surgery is
overestimated. However, when it occurs, it is associated with high morbidity and
mortality, deserving constant vigilance. Despite being an unspecific marker of
inflammation, C-reactive protein (CRP) and alkaline phosphatase are measured
routinely by hospital laboratories and therefore would make useful markers in
cardiac surgery. In addition, the relation neutrophil/lymphocyte (N/L) and the
relation platelet/lymphocyte (P/L) have become useful inflammation biomarkers.</p><p>Finally, we would close the present editorial answering the provocative title
question: Cardiopulmonary Bypass Systemic Inflammatory Response is Overestimated,
Which is Better than Underestimated.</p></sec><sec><title>Articles in this Issue</title><p>This issue of BJCVS presents a blind peer-reviewed selection of 16 papers that will
surely please our readers. The vast majority related to various perioperative
problems. We selected the articles by order of acceptance (11 original papers, 2
article reviews, and 2 elected case reports, 1 point of view).</p><p>Doctors Gabriel Romero Liguori and Luiz Felipe Pinho Moreira created this editorial
series entitled "Operating with Data - Statistics for the Cardiovascular Surgeon".
The series will merit five editorials, each one describing a different aspect of
statistical analysis relevant for the cardiovascular surgeon, as follows: &#x02022;
Part I. Fundamentals of Biostatistics; &#x02022; Part II. Association and Risk;
&#x02022; Part III. Comparing Groups; &#x02022; Part IV. Correlations and Regression;
&#x02022; Part V. Survival Analysis. The BJCVS and its readers thank the commendable
initiative of Drs. Liguori and Moreira. We clarify that, although with unusual
characteristics of an opening editorial, we decided to consider the texts as
Editorial to highlight them. The Part I was published on the 33.3
edition<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sig-block><sig><bold>Paulo Roberto B. Evora</bold><break/><sup>1</sup>Editor-in-Chief Interim &#x02013;

Here, we tissue-engineered and validated an in vitro microtissue model of osteoblastic bone metastases, and used it to study the effects of androgen deprivation in this microenvironment. The model was established by culturing primary human osteoprogenitor cells on melt electrowritten polymer scaffolds, leading to a mineralized osteoblast-derived microtissue containing, in a 3D setting, viable osteoblastic cells, osteocytic cells, and appropriate expression of osteoblast/osteocyte-derived mRNA and proteins, and mineral content. Direct co-culture of androgen receptor-dependent/independent cell lines (LNCaP, C4-2B, and PC3) led cancer cells to display functional and molecular features as observed in vivo. Co-cultured cancer cells showed increased affinity to the microtissues, as a function of their bone metastatic potential. Co-cultures led to alkaline phosphatase and collagen-I upregulation and sclerostin downregulation, consistent with the clinical marker profile of osteoblastic bone metastases. LNCaP showed a significant adaptive response under androgen deprivation in the microtissues, with the notable appearance of neuroendocrine transdifferentiation features and increased expression of related markers (dopa decarboxylase, enolase 2). Androgen deprivation affected the biology of the metastatic microenvironment with stronger upregulation of androgen receptor, alkaline phosphatase, and dopa decarboxylase, as seen in the transition towards resistance. The unique microtissues engineered here represent a substantial asset to determine the involvement of the human bone microenvironment in prostate cancer progression and response to a therapeutic context in this microenvironment.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="LongSummary"><title>Cancer: 3D model mimics prostate cancer metastasis to bone</title><p id="Par2">A three-dimensional model of prostate tumor cells growing in a bone-like microenvironment offers a new platform for studying how metastatic prostate cancers respond to therapies. Dietmar Hutmacher&#x02028;and colleagues from the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia, engineered a bone-like tissue environment by culturing bone progenitor cells in a fibrous polyester scaffold. The cells differentiated into bone-forming cells that produced the appropriate RNAs, proteins and minerals. The researchers then added various populations of prostate cancer cells to the constructs. Cell lines with the greatest bone metastatic potential grew best, and depriving cells of the hormone androgen led to a more aggressive disease phenotype consistent with that observed in the tumors of men with castration-resistant prostate cancer. The system offers a new way to test for relevant biomarkers and therapeutics in the laboratory.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Bone cancer</kwd><kwd>Bone cancer</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>Department of Health | National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100000927</institution-id><institution>Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia (PCFA)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001026</institution-id><institution>National Breast Cancer Foundation (NBCF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Department of Education and Training | Australian Research Council (ARC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IC160100026</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hutmacher</surname><given-names>Dietmar W.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Advance Queensland Research Fellowship, QUT Vice Chancellor Research Fellowship</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Movember Revolutionary Team Award</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) present with incurable bone metastases in 90% of cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> Bone metastases are the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in patients, with changes in the structural integrity of bone, associated with pain, debilitating skeletal-related events, and death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> The interactions between bone microenvironment, rich in extracellular matrix proteins/stromal cells, and metastatic cancer cells, are an important component of the bone organ-specific progression of prostate cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> Unfortunately, the current models lack the complexity of native bone tumor microenvironments, far from recapitulating individual aspects of the disease that enable the mechanistic advances needed to improve clinical outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup></p><p id="Par4">While rare prostate cancers, such as neuroendocrine, produce osteolytic or mixed osteolytic/osteoblastic lesions, metastases from most adenocarcinomas produce osteoblastic lesions, due to increased osteoblast activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> Prostate cancer influences bone homeostasis mostly by secreting paracrine factors that support osteoblast proliferation by direct effects (via growth factors&#x02014;bone morphogenetic proteins, transforming growth factors, insulin growth factors),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> or by modifying factors present in the bone microenvironment (urokinase-type plasminogen activator, prostate-specific antigen (PSA)).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> PSA, the gold marker for prostate cancer progression, can indeed cleave various substrates in the bone microenvironment, including parathyroid-hormone-related protein,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> which in turn decreases bone resorption, making osteoblasts more predominant. While some growth factors expressed by osteoblasts are well-known to promote prostate tumor growth in the bone, a gap remains as many of these stimulating bone/tumor-derived factors have not yet been identified.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup></p><p id="Par5">With androgen signaling being key in prostate cancer, the use of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the treatment of choice for patients with recurrent disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> While initially responsive, ADT ultimately leads to castrate resistance, by androgen receptor reactivation (AR) in cancer cells and adaption of stromal cells through direct sensitivity to AR targeting and paracrine interactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> With most patients remaining on androgen deprivation throughout their disease, ADT may contribute not only to cancer cell adaptation towards resistance, but may equally involve stroma adaptation favorable to metastasis progression. In the bone, androgen deprivation can indeed alter both osteoblastogenesis and osteoclastogenesis, negatively affecting the bone tumor microenvironment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> Currently, defining the exact mechanisms behind cancer transition to castrate resistance in the bone microenvironment remains challenging, yet key to improving clinical outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> Considering the dominant role of osteoblasts in prostate cancer progression, a pre-clinical in vitro disease model that more closely mimics osteoblast/cancer interactions, is critical to investigate the adaptive response of this microenvironment in response to ADT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup></p><p id="Par6">In the last two decades, the unmet need for better in vitro cancer models has drawn tissue-engineering technologies into the arena of cancer research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> Tissue-engineered cancer models more faithfully recapitulate native three-dimensional (3D) microenvironments by better mimicking native structural and biochemical properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> Critical cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions can better be recreated using spatio-temporal approaches, ultimately leading to a more accurate study of a specific microenvironment. The ability to dissociate biological processes is equally important to gain insight into specific interactions between targeted cell populations. In the context of prostate cancer, where lesions are mostly osteoblast-driven, fundamental advances will be gained by separating the bone formation process from the bone resorption process, and opting for an osteoclast-free approach, as successfully justified previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup></p><p id="Par7">In this work, we present for the first time a tissue-engineered model that comprises both osteoblastic cells, osteocytic cells, and appropriate expression of osteoblast and osteocyte-derived proteins and mineral content. This model, viable long-term, can represent some of the key cellular and microenvironmental interactions between osteoblasts, their produces and prostate cancer for a more accurate study of osteoblastic bone metastases. The model is validated here by co-culture studies with metastatic prostate cancer cell lines, testing the hypothesis that the in vitro osteoblastic tumor microenvironment could reproduce some of the cellular alterations seen in vivo with androgen deprivation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Bioengineering of a human osteoblast-derived microtissue</title><p id="Par8">Additive manufacturing and tissue-engineering technologies were combined to establish an in vitro osteoblast-derived microtissue model to study prostate cancer osteoblastic bone metastases.

One strength of this model is rooted in its capability to perform long-term studies and osteoblast-derived microtissues displaying the morphological features of a highly mineralized mature tissue. The presence of osteocytic cells enabled the expression of mature bone markers, which is often not seen in 2D, and not well-designed 3D, models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> Osteocytes are multifunctional cells with many regulatory roles in bone and mineral homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> and have recently been implicated in prostate cancer bone metastases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> Osteocytes influence bone remodeling in both osteoblastic and osteolytic lesions, although little is known about their roles in osteotropic cancer bone metastasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> The glycoprotein sclerostin, which we identified at the gene/protein levels here, is only expressed by mature osteocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> Sclerostin plays an important role for the catabolic activity of bone by controlling the <italic>RANK</italic>/<italic>OPG</italic> mRNA ratio, which ultimately affects prostate cancer bone metastases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> Here, the ability of our platform to provide long-term cell viability, as well as high-mineral deposition in a 3D setting was essential to trigger osteoblast-to-osteocyte transition by osteoblast burial within the matrix,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and led to successful osteocytogenesis, as seen at the mRNA and protein levels.</p><p id="Par35">Direct-contact 3D cancer assays are critical to assess cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions. Biophysical, as much as biochemical, interactions indeed promote cancer transition towards resistance, with explicit adaptive phenotype.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> In processes controlled by pseudopodial actin dynamics,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and neuroendocrine transdifferentiation, cancer cells display distinct morphological features of the adaptive response, which ultimately informs about transition to castrate resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> Using quantitative measures, such as cell volume, shape factor or orientation on matrix, it is hence possible to identify, within the microenvironment, what conditions lead to such phenotypes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> With the set of quantitative methodologies established here, we demonstrated that PC3, the most prolific cell line used in the osteoblast-derived microtissues, did not respond to androgen deprivation, and that LNCaP and the castrate-resistant sub-line C4-2B behaved more similarly and how they responded to androgen deprivation. LNCaP presented clear adaptation with the appearance of NEtD features, which was correlated with the increased expression of NEtD markers, <italic>DDC</italic>, and <italic>ENO2</italic>.

The cells still reached similar proliferative, migratory, and morphometric properties as C4-2B under androgen deprivation. Higher migratory properties seen for C4-2B in androgen-replete conditions corroborated the fact that C4-2B are past the transition to castrate resistance and derived from bone metastases formed by LNCaP, hence are used to growing in this microenvironment. Importantly, a vast majority of castration-resistant cases are not truly depleted of androgens and still use androgens to maintain cell proliferation and tumor growth,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> hence the effects observed here on C4-2B.</p><p id="Par37">The osteoblast-derived microenvironment showed active participation to the adaptive transition of cancer cells. Under androgen deprivation, <italic>PSA</italic> was upregulated in LNCaP/hOBMT co-cultures, a direct consequence of osteoblast-secreted factors, such as interleukin-6, that cause androgen-independent induction of <italic>PSA</italic> gene expression. This process contributes to maintaining LNCaP proliferation and migration in the bone microenvironment by a mechanism that partially relies on AR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> Co-culture of AR responsive LNCaP and C4-2B cells with hOBMT under androgen-replete conditions generated over-expression of important bone markers found in clinical samples (COL1) and serum levels (ALP), the latter a common feature of patients with bone metastatic prostate cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>
<italic>SOST</italic> downregulation, concomitant to <italic>ALP</italic>/<italic>COL1</italic> upregulation, is in line with the profile of osteoblastic bone metastases seen in advanced prostate cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> After androgen removal, these changes (<italic>ALP</italic>, <italic>COL1</italic>, <italic>SOST</italic>) were more accentuated, but mostly in LNCaP/hOBMT co-cultures, due to LNCaP&#x02019;s higher degree of AR responsiveness. As <italic>SOST</italic> is expressed by some prostate cancer cells, circulating sclerostin levels are usually significantly increased in prostate cancer patients and particularly in those receiving ADT,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> as androgens are key regulators of bone metabolism in this population. Consistent with these findings, <italic>SOST</italic> expression, provided here by the osteocytic population from hOBMT was heightened by androgen deprivation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> also explaining the reduced migration observed for C4-2B under androgen deprivation. In fact, <italic>SOST</italic> has an inhibitory effect on prostate cancer invasion,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> which induced lower rates of metastasis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> and a lack of <italic>SOST</italic> within bone promotes expression of genes associated with cell migration/invasion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> Finally, even when <italic>SOST</italic> expression was heightened by androgen deprivation, overall expression levels from co-cultures were kept low (C4-2B/hOBMT) or strongly downregulated (LNCaP/hOBMT), compared to monocultures. This is the demonstration of a clear adaptive response from the bone tumor microenvironment to aid metastasis progression. In future, it will also be important to investigate other metastatic cell lines, such as VCaP, DuCaP, or C4-2, to further unravel the effects of androgen deprivation for those metastatic variants in the osteoblast-derived microenvironment. Finally, the use of patient-derived tissues (xenografts, prostatectomy samples) in co-culture with the microtissues would be warranted in the future as a predictive platform for the testing of current and novel therapeutics for individual patients.</p><p id="Par38">Overall, the tissue-engineered model combined with the quantitative methodologies presented here form the basis of an authoritative novel pre-clinical platform to interrogate osteoblasts/cancer cells interactions. Technical challenges remain, as direct-contact models provide a complex milieu, which challenges downstream analyses,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> with difficulties including the recovery of mRNA and proteins. Importantly, the proposed model focused on prostate cancer interactions with osteoblasts, osteocytes, and their respective ECM, due to the pathological relevance of osteoblastic lesions, yet some prostate cancer types present with mixed osteoblastic and osteolytic lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup> Osteoclasts indeed rely on <italic>RANKL</italic>, <italic>OPG</italic>, and matrix metalloproteinases, among others,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> which may all be expressed by prostate cancer cells, ultimately affecting the crosstalk with osteoblasts, in turn influencing the resulting predominant lesion type.

The validation of the model&#x02019;s responsiveness to androgens and androgen deprivation, with observations akin to the clinical scenario, warrants a more accurate study of the transition to castrate resistance and implications in the osteoblastic tumor microenvironment.

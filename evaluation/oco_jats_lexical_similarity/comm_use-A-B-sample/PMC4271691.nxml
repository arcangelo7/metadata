It proposes that girls aged 9 to 13&#x000a0;years should receive two doses of the vaccine, rather than three doses as previously recommended &#x02013; a change that will save costs for health systems.</p><p>The guide also includes a new recommendation to incorporate HPV testing in cervical cancer prevention programmes, a change that has the potential to increase the coverage of screening and improve the quality of national cervical cancer programmes. </p><p>It advises that HPV testing should be offered to women aged over 30&#x000a0;years. However, if HIV prevalence is high, testing should be offered to younger women. If the test result is negative, the woman should not be tested again for at least five years. A positive test result &#x02013; indicating that she may have a lesion or be at risk of developing cancer in the future &#x02013; would need further investigation.</p><p>HPV testing is being incorporated into cervical cancer prevention programmes in high-resource settings as a primary screening test, but samples need transportation and processing at a laboratory before results can be returned. </p><p>A new low-cost test for HPV infection that can be processed with minimal laboratory infrastructure is being tried out in low-resource settings and may soon be available.</p><p>The updated guide highlights the importance of communicating differently around cervical cancer prevention, now that HPV vaccines have been introduced. Instead of focusing on screening for women aged 30 and over, the guide recommends communicating with a wider audience, including adolescents, parents, educators and health professionals, to reach women throughout their lives.</p><p>In 2012, an estimated 528&#x000a0;000 new cases of cervical cancer were diagnosed, and 266&#x000a0;000 women died of the disease, nearly 90% of them in low- to middle-income countries. </p><p>Without urgent attention, deaths due to cervical cancer are projected to rise by almost 25% over the next 10&#x000a0;years. </p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/cancers/cervical-cancer-guide">http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/cancers/cervical-cancer-guide</ext-link>

China is the world&#x02019;s largest producer and consumer of tobacco products, with more than 300 million smokers.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wpro.who.int/china/mediacentre/releases/2014/2014112802">http://www.wpro.who.int/china/mediacentre/releases/2014/2014112802</ext-link>

At the end of 2013, many inpatient health facilities in those countries remained closed while fewer people sought medical attendance at outpatient facilities for fear of becoming infected with the Ebola virus.</p><p>Given the intense malaria transmission in these three countries, WHO has issued new recommendations on temporary measures to control malaria during the Ebola outbreak: to provide ACTs to all fever patients, whether they have been tested or not, to carry out mass anti-malarial drug administration with ACTs in areas that are heavily affected by the Ebola virus and where malaria transmission is high and to distribute insecticide-treated bednets to all areas affected by the epidemic.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/world_malaria_report_2014">http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/world_malaria_report_2014</ext-link>

However, the cellular identity of the primary MSC in human lung tissues has not yet been reported. This study therefore aimed to identify and characterise the &#x02018;bona fide&#x02019; MSC in human lungs and to investigate if the MSC numbers correlate with the development of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome in lung-transplanted patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Primary lung MSC were directly isolated or culture-derived from central and peripheral transbronchial biopsies of lung-transplanted patients and evaluated using a comprehensive panel of in vitro and in vivo assays.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Primary MSC were enriched in the CD90/CD105 mononuclear cell fraction with mesenchymal progenitor frequencies of up to four colony-forming units, fibroblast/100 cells. In situ staining of lung tissues revealed that CD90/CD105 MSCs were located perivascularly. MSC were tissue-resident and exclusively donor lung-derived even in biopsies obtained from patients as long as 16&#x02005;years after transplantation. Culture-derived mesenchymal stromal cells showed typical in vitro MSC properties; however, xenotransplantation into non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice showed that lung MSC readily differentiated into adipocytes and stromal tissues, but lacked significant in vivo bone formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These data clearly demonstrate that primary MSC in human lung tissues are not only tissue resident but also tissue-specific.

These CFU-F cells are considered to reflect the primary MSC and, on further proliferation in culture, their descendants make up the extensively studied cultured mesenchymal stromal cells.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>MSC have a number of intriguing properties, that is, high proliferation potential, differentiation capacity into different mesenchymal cell types such as adipocytes, osteoblasts and chondrocytes, capacities to produce a variety of different cytokines, chemokines, extracellular matrix and microvesicles, as well as potent immunomodulatory function.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;11</xref></p><p>Owing to these features, MSC have become promising candidates for cellular therapies. For example, with regard to pulmonary diseases, MSC have been demonstrated to reduce inflammation and fibrosis in lung injury mouse models.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> MSC have also been proposed as potential precursors for fibroblasts/myofibroblasts, thereby contributing to the development of fibrotic obliteration of small airways.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>Fibrotic obliteration of the peripheral airways (obliterative bronchiolitis) is the hallmark of chronic rejection after lung transplantation, affecting approximately 50&#x02013;60% of patients within 5&#x02005;years after transplantation and constituting the main cause of long-term morbidity and mortality. Since obliterative bronchiolitis is a patchy disease, the term bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is used clinically and is defined by a decline in lung function and is measured by spirometry and further graded from one to three based on the lung function results.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>

<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> However, little is known about cellular identity and properties of primary &#x02018;bona fide&#x02019; MSC in the lung, which is the key information required to investigate the function and physiological/pathophysiological role of MSC in situ.</p><p>We demonstrate&#x02014;for the first time&#x02014;the identity, phenotype and localisation of primary MSC in lung tissues of lung-transplanted patients from central and peripheral transbronchial biopsies. Our results show that lung MSC are tissue-resident cells with typical MSC properties except for in vivo bone formation, thus indicating that pulmonary MSC represent a population of tissue-specific stromal progenitor cells.

Despite this potentially important role of MSC in lung physiology, relatively little is known about the cellular identity and biological function of the primary human lung MSC in health and disease. Thus far, only culture-derived stromal cells from BAL fluid,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> fetal and adult healthy lung tissues have been investigated.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> We therefore aimed to isolate primary pulmonary MSC in lung tissue from transplanted patients in order to investigate their origin and anatomical localisation within the lung tissue, as well as to characterise their mesenchymal properties in vivo and in vitro.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells, as assessed by CFU-F assays, were present in central and peripheral transbronchial biopsies. CFU-F frequencies were significantly higher in the central biopsies indicating, in accordance with what has been reported previously,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> that there are differences in lung structure between central and peripheral sections. Interestingly, there was no correlation between CFU-F number and BOS grade, indicating that lung-derived tissue-resident MSC could not be used as a predictor for BOS development. Badri <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> on the other hand, reported previously that the measurement of CFU-F in BAL fluid provided predictive information regarding future BOS onset in lung-transplanted patients. This finding leads to the assumption that CFU-F numbers in transplanted lung tissues might be independent from CFU-F numbers in BAL fluids. However, as we have not directly compared these two cell sources, we cannot draw any definite conclusions at this point of time. Alternatively, lung tissue and BAL MSC might have biological differences and therefore react differently to pathological stress situations. Certainly, this is an important consideration which is worth addressing in future experiments.</p><p>One of the fundamental properties of MSC is their multilineage differentiation capacity, which is commonly evaluated only by in vitro assays. Our data show that pulmonary MSC possessed standard multilineage differentiation potential in vitro, thus formally fulfilling the requirements for MSC definition, but they lacked proper bone formation in vivo. This indicates that lung MSC and bone marrow-derived MSC are biologically different as bone marrow MSC robustly formed bone in xenotransplantation experiments.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Based on the fact that the differentiation spectrum of bone marrow-derived MSC also differs from other MSC preparations, such as adipocyte-derived and umbilical vein-derived stromal cells, it is reasonable to conclude that MSC are tissue-specific.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p><p>Furthermore, our observation that lung-derived MSC possessed a full three-lineage potential only in vitro, which is most likely due to supraphysiological levels of differentiation-inducing signals in standard in vitro cultures, stresses the importance of in vivo experiments to assess proper differentiation potential.</p><p>We analysed lung-derived MSC by XY chromosome analysis and our data clearly demonstrate that pulmonary MSC in lung-transplanted patients were donor derived. Interestingly, different origins of pulmonary MSC have been discussed, with one of the hypotheses being that MSC are recruited from the bone marrow through the circulation.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> However, our results in accordance with data previously reported by Lama <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> provide compelling evidence that lung-derived MSC are tissue-resident cells. Some of the analysed MSC were isolated from biopsies taken as long as nearly 16&#x02005;years after transplantation, indicating that lung-resident MSC either are very long-lived cells or that they might possess self-renewal capacity, which is certainly an important point given the recent data providing evidence for in vivo self-renewal of murine and human MSC.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p><p>Until now, only culture-derived lung MSC have been studied and the phenotype of the primary lung MSC has thus far been elusive. We identify&#x02014;for the first time&#x02014;the phenotype of primary lung-derived MSC. Using FACS sorting of primary lung cells, we could demonstrate that the CD90/CD105 cell fraction was highly enriched for CFU-F. Based on our previous results on the isolation of CFU-F in primary bone marrow-derived cells, we initially started sorting based on CD271 and CD146 expression,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> but this combination did not allow to enrich for lung CFU-F, which furthermore strengthens the tissue specificity of MSC.</p><p>Owing to the fact that only limited numbers of cells were available for sorting due to the small size of the tissue biopsies, it was not possible to reanalyse the sorted cell fractions. Therefore, colonies growing from single positive CD105 cells might be the result of sorting impurities. Here, the sorting of a larger number of cells, for example, from lung explants would be necessary, which is certainly an important consideration for future experiments.</p><p>On the basis of the identification of the phenotype of primary lung MSC, we then could address the important question of where these cells are located in situ in the lung tissue. Here, our experiments showed that CD90/CD105 double positive cells were found exclusively perivascularly. The perivascular location of the pulmonary MSC is thus in accordance with what has been demonstrated in other organs such as bone marrow.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>

Ortiz <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, for example, demonstrated that the administration of bone marrow-derived MSC into bleomycin-treated mice resulted in decreased inflammation and collagen deposition. Furthermore, Rojas <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> reported an increased production of growth factors, a better survival and reduced inflammation in bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice treated with bone marrow-derived MSC.

Based on our data showing differences in the differentiation potential of bone marrow and lung MSC, we would suggest that pulmonary-derived MSC might be more appropriate for the treatment of lung diseases. It is tempting to speculate that lung-derived MSC could be used as a cell-based therapy for treatment of lung diseases like chronic rejection. Lung-derived MSC for clinical use could, for example, be generated from normal, non-diseased human adult or fetal lungs, the latter of which is an excellent source for MSC.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> However, the availability of both cell sources is limited and, furthermore, the use of fetal tissues raises ethical considerations.

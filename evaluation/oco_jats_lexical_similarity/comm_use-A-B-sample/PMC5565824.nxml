Overall, 23 837 children were deemed high risk by their GPs, and were prescribed 98 737 AAI devices. This equates to 4.67 children (95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.66 to 4.69), and 19.4 (95% CI = 19.2 to 19.5) devices per 1000 person years. Between 2000 and 2012, there has been a 355% increase in the number of children prescribed devices, and a 506% increase in the total number of AAI devices prescribed per 1000 person years in the UK. The number of devices issued per high-risk child during this period has also increased by 33%.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The number of children being prescribed AAI devices and the number of devices being prescribed in UK primary care between 2000 and 2012 has significantly increased.

A few children (8%) received only one, and 24% received more than four devices per year. On average, each high-risk child received 3.84 devices per year during the study period. When the data were arbitrarily divided into two groups (2000&#x02013;2006 and 2007&#x02013;2012), the authors found that the proportion of high-risk children receiving four or more devices is increasing (41% in 2000&#x02013;2006 versus 54% in 2007&#x02013;2012) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The types of devices prescribed commonly are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. Almost all of the children &#x02264;5 years of age were prescribed a &#x02018;junior&#x02019; device (150 &#x003bc;g adrenaline per dose), whereas just over half of those &#x02265;6 years (52.5%) had a junior device.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold><italic>Proportion of children receiving one to four or more adrenaline auto-injectors (AAI) devices in the years 2000 to 2012.</italic></bold></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bjgpApr-2017-67-657-e300-2"/></fig><p>The average cost of an AAI device was &#x000a3;25.80 (95% CI = &#x000a3;24.7 to &#x000a3;26.9).<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Given that the THIN database represents 6% of the UK population, the authors estimate that the annual expenditure on AAI devices for children in the UK was approximately &#x000a3;6.89 million in 2012.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Summary</title><p>The data show a sharp increase in both the proportion of children prescribed AAI devices and the number of AAI devices prescribed for early management of anaphylaxis between the years 2000 and 2012 in the UK. Given that only half of the &#x02018;high-risk&#x02019; children were noted as having a previous relevant allergy or anaphylaxis diagnosis, the rationale for prescribing is, in many cases, unclear.</p><p>The authors also found a considerable variation in the number of devices prescribed to children in the UK. One-quarter of all high-risk children receive more than four devices in a year. More than 2% receive &#x0003e;10 devices per year. Of potential concern is the significant increase in the number of devices being prescribed to children &#x02264;1 year old (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), given that AAI devices were, until recently, unlicensed for use in children who weigh &#x0003c;15 kg.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Recent changes to licensing indications for Epipen<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, however, allow for a junior dose to be prescribed to children who weigh between 7.5 and 25 kg.<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>The rate of admissions into hospitals in England for anaphylaxis has increased over this period, although mortality rates have decreased.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> It is not clear whether these reductions in mortality are directly related to the increase in AAI prescription. Assuming that the admission rates into UK hospitals for anaphylaxis was seven per 100 000 in 2012,<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> the authors estimate that approximately 400 devices were prescribed per child admitted into hospital in that year. The benefits and risks of such prescribing are not clear. The current annual expenditure on AAI devices for children in the UK is approximately &#x000a3;7 million. Given that these devices have a limited shelf-life and need to be renewed regularly, the costs could escalate considerably if the current trend continues.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This study is the first to provide individual level, longitudinal data on the availability of AAI among children in the UK. The authors used the THIN database, a large primary care dataset that has been shown to be reliable and representative of the UK population.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Although there are some concerns regarding the quality of data and coding in healthcare datasets in general,<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> it is accepted that they provide a credible snapshot of healthcare demand and provision across the country.<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Primary care practices use their clinical system to issue prescriptions; prescribing data are, therefore, likely to be reliable and complete. Since the majority of adrenaline devices in the UK are obtained using prescriptions from GPs, this analysis is likely to represent the true availability of these devices in the community.</p><p>Data from THIN only identify individuals who actively consult their GP. Children who have allergies but do not consult their GP will not be represented in the database. A further limitation of the study is the lack of comprehensive data regarding the indications for AAI prescription, the reasons for repeat prescriptions, and the number of episodes of anaphylaxis/serious allergy experienced by an individual. It was also not possible for the authors to ascertain if all of the prescriptions were dispensed. The dataset only included data until 2012. However, the authors do not expect that more recent data will show significant deviations from the trends demonstrated.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with existing literature</title><p>The increase in the rate of prescription of AAI devices in England has been reported by others.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> However, this is the first report that uses primary care data to provide a detailed analysis of the current primary care prescribing practices for AAI to UK children. The authors are able to demonstrate an increase in the number of children receiving these devices, as well as in the number of devices received per child.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Implications for practice and research</title><p>This study clearly demonstrates that there has been a significant increase in the number of children being prescribed AAI devices in the UK. In addition, there has been an increase in the average number of devices being prescribed per child in the community. This places a significant financial burden on the NHS.</p><p>The role of AAI in the management of anaphylaxis is not very clear. Some suggest that it should be administered early in the onset of anaphylaxis, and such use can indeed reduce the need for adrenaline in hospital and subsequent hospital admission.<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> However, fatalities occur despite early and appropriate use of AAI.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> A 2014 review by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) suggested that the currently marketed AAI devices may not provide a sufficient intramuscular dose of adrenaline in most individuals, increasing the uncertainty around their efficacy in emergencies.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Recent guidance published by the BSACI suggested that only one AAI should be issued per individual, although children may be issued with two (one for home and one for school). Prescribing two devices can be considered in certain situations (for example, in the case of a patient who is obese, remoteness from medical help, or a history of previous anaphylaxis needing two AAI injections).<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Although there are some arguments that AAI devices provide reassurance to parents and children, others have shown that carrying these devices is sometimes detrimental to health-related quality of life (HRQoL).<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> There are no clear guidelines on the optimal number of devices per child. The MHRA has recommended that a second device should be carried by every patient as a backup.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Although a recent survey suggested that most UK clinicians advise that patients carry two AAIs with them at all times,<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> this analysis suggests that most children are prescribed more than two devices per year.</p><p>The short shelf life of the devices at the time of purchase may result in multiple prescriptions in a given year. Parents or carers may request additional devices to hold with childminders or other family members, in addition to those at home and school. In general, there are no data to suggest that provision of extra (beyond two) devices can be life-saving or provide reassurance.<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In order to be effective, devices should be prescribed alongside appropriate training and support in their use. Unfortunately, this is often lacking.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In addition, it is difficult to ensure that individuals always carry AAIs with them, that their devices are in date, and that their training is updated regularly to ensure correct administration of the device in an emergency.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Hence there is a need for a robust discussion on the rational prescribing of AAI devices. Indications for AAI prescription among children and on the optimal number of devices that can be issued per child need to be clarified. This will not only have implications for the wellbeing of patients at risk of anaphylaxis, but can also be cost saving to the NHS.</p></sec></sec></body><back><notes><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Lavanya Diwakar is funded by the Wellcome Trust (Ref: 100064/Z/12/Z).

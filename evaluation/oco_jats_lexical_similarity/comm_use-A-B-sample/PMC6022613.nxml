Such treatments can only be used with informed consent from patients and as long as protocols are followed, with close monitoring and reporting of any adverse events.</p><p>A group of experts convened by WHO on 16-17 May 2018, agreed that the ethical framework, known as <italic>Monitored emergency use of unregistered and experimental interventions</italic>, could be applied in the current DRC outbreak. </p><p>According to the framework, it may be ethical to offer patients experimental interventions on an emergency basis outside of clinical trials, as long as certain conditions are met in the context of an outbreak with high mortality. </p><p>Conditions are: no proven effective treatment exists, it&#x02019;s not possible to start clinical studies immediately and data are available providing preliminary support for the intervention&#x02019;s safety and efficacy at least in laboratory or animal studies. </p><p>ZMapp was tested during the 2014&#x02013;16 West African outbreak, but the trial did not reach enough participants to produce conclusive evidence of efficacy. </p><p>There are fewer clinical data available for the second therapeutic, Remdesivir (GS-5734), than for ZMapp in patients with Ebola, and no data on Remdesivir&#x02019;s efficacy in humans beyond anecdotal experience. </p><p>The results from animal studies for REGN3470-3471-3479 are similar to those observed with ZMapp. There are limited human safety data available from a phase 1 study of REGN3470-3471-3479 and these findings suggest that the compound is well tolerated in humans. </p><p>The fourth therapeutic, mAb 114, is at a very early stage of development with data that allowed the start of a phase 1 trial in May 2018. For the fifth therapeutic, Favipiravir, there are limited human data and uncertainties on the required dosing regimen.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bit.ly/2sK8LCF">http://bit.ly/2sK8LCF</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>WHO physical activity plan</title><p>A new WHO plan outlines the policies needed to make it easier for people to be physically active and calls on governments to implement these to reduce physical inactivity by 15% by 2030.</p><p>The <italic>WHO Global action plan on physical activity and health 2018-2030: more active people for a healthier world,</italic> recommends policies in 20 areas to encourage more activity, including walking, cycling and sport, for example by creating sidewalks and cycle paths.</p><p>To support countries to implement the plan, WHO launched a campaign to promote physical activity entitled, <italic>Let&#x02019;s be active: everyone, everywhere, everyday</italic>.</p><p>The campaign follows the 1 June release of six policy recommendations for countries by the Independent High-level Commission on Noncommunicable Diseases.</p><p>One in five adults and four of five adolescents (11-17 years) globally do not get enough physical activity.

Its members will include political leaders, heads of United Nations agencies and leading health experts.</p><p>The initiative&#x02019;s launch comes in the midst of an Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, underscoring the need for concerted efforts to tackle such outbreaks and other health crises, and to ensure that all countries have the core capacities required under the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005).</p><p>The Board will monitor preparedness worldwide and issue an annual report on issues that they have identified, as well as noting parallel or duplicative efforts in health crisis preparedness.</p><p>The United Nations Secretary-General&#x02019;s Global Health Crises Task Force, created in response to the 2013-2016 West Africa Ebola outbreak, called for robust monitoring of global health emergency preparedness in July 2017.</p><p>Since then, WHO and the World Bank have been working together to establish the new Global Preparedness Monitoring Board.

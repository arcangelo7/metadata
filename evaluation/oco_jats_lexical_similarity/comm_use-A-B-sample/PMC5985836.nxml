experimental evidence shows that the main events leading to cell and tissue
dysfunction are related to reperfusion<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The ischemia and reperfusion (IR) injury constitutes a pathophysiological event
common to several diseases of daily clinical practice. The lung can be the target of
the IR lesion directly, as in pulmonary edema after transplantation or in the
resolution of thromboembolism, or be reached at a distance, as in cases of shock or
reperfusion injury in the intestine or lower limbs, as occurs in the aortic
clamping, used in aneurysm surgeries<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>It was believed that the lung was more resistant to ischemic lesions than other
organs. Two factors contributed to this: the presence of bronchial circulation in
addition to the pulmonary circulation and the fact that interruption of pulmonary
blood flow is not accompanied by hypoxia since alveolar ventilation is maintained.
The lung can be considered the only organ that can suffer ischemia without
hypoxia<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>However, evidence has emerged in recent years that the lung may not be completely
immune to reperfusion injury, despite maintained gas exchange, since reactive oxygen
species (ROS) act systemically. In surgeries with temporary aortic occlusion,
pulmonary edema is a frequent complication, with a multifactorial etiology,
including reperfusion injury. Already during ischemia, there is an increase in
pulmonary arterial pressure, a factor that may favor the formation of edema in the
lungs. This increased resistance in the pulmonary circulation results in part from a
greater blood flow due to its redistribution to the territory above the occlusion
and from the increase in left ventricular end-diastolic volume, whose emptying is
impaired by the increase that the occlusion of the aorta imposes on
post-loading<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>IR is associated with the production of another inflammatory mediator, tumor necrosis
factor (TNF). Lesion of the intestinal mucosa by IR allows the release of endotoxin
into the portal circulation, inducing the production of TNF by liver macrophages.
Increased TNF in the systemic circulation is capable of leading to inflammatory lung
injury, characterized by accumulation of neutrophils. This sequence of events was
demonstrated by Caty et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> in an IR model by temporary occlusion of the
superior mesenteric artery in rats. After reperfusion, endotoxin levels in portal
venous blood and TNF were increased in the systemic circulation. In parallel, there
was accumulation of neutrophils in the lungs and increased pulmonary capillary
permeability.</p><p>Some techniques for protection against reperfusion injury have already been tried and
tested, and among them, ischemic postconditioning (IPC), which consists of one or
more short cycles of reperfusion, followed by one or more short cycles of ischemia,
immediately after the ischemic phase and before permanent reperfusion occurs.
Although IPC has already shown a protective effect in many organs submitted to IR as
well as in distance protection<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>, its efficacy in the prevention of remote lung
injury is still very early<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Much has been studied about the pathophysiology of reperfusion injury and some
mechanisms have already been well evidenced, such as the role of free radicals,
vascular endothelial dysfunction, and neutrophil-mediated
injury<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. Recently, there has been an increase in interest in
statins, drugs known for their antidislipidemic effect, this time due to its
pleiotropic effect, which is characterized by anti-inflammatory properties,
immunomodulating, antithrombogenic actions and improvement of endothelial
function<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. Recent experimental studies<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> have shown promising
results with the use of statins demonstrating their role in the protection against
IR injury, a fact that led us to inquire about their benefits facing reperfusion
injury.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of IPC and atorvastatin,
alone and in combination, in the prevention of reperfusion injury in the lungs of
rats subjected to IR by aortic clamping.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>The study was approved by the Committee of Ethics in Animal Experimentation of the

approximately four centimeters, exteriorization of the small intestine,
identification and dissection of infra-renal abdominal aorta artery.</p><p>In all groups except SHAM, the abdominal aorta was occluded by atraumatic vascular

small intestine was repositioned into the abdominal cavity and the surgical wound
was closed with continuous suture of the skin with 4-0 monofilament nylon. After the
ischemia phase, the abdominal wall was reopened by removal of the suture and in the
I/R and A groups, the vascular clamp was removed, initiating the reperfusion phase,
lasting 70 minutes. In the IPC and IPC+A groups, preceding the reperfusion phase,
the IPC was performed by four cycles of reperfusion (removal of the atraumatic

</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Ischemia followed by reperfusion may induce apoptosis and an inflammatory response
that affects tissue repair, especially in the lung. As a result, many evaluated the
impact of IPC in subsequent apoptotic and inflammatory responses. In experimental IR
models in rats with 30 minutes of ischemia and three hours of reperfusion there was
a significant decrease in tissue necrosis with IPC. There is also a decrease in ROS
generation and protection of mitochondrial integrity, suggesting that the protective
effect of IPC may be the result of a reduction in the inflammatory response.
However, few studies have directly assessed the impact of IPC on inflammation. IPC
may limit the expression of P-selectin, which is required for neutrophil bearing and
recruitment. In addition, it may reduce the accumulation of neutrophils in the
affected region, decrease to ischemic vascular endothelial adhesion, and attenuate
the endothelial dysfunction of the involved vessel, events that normally occur in
IR<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The main histological findings observed in the different groups can be observed in

</p><p>In the present study, we observed pulmonary protection with IPC, demonstrating the
efficacy of the method against this IR model, which can be justified by the fact
that ROS, regardless of where they are produced, when reperfusion occurs throughout
the body causing the remote reperfusion injury, so much so that in the I/R group a
marked lesion in the lungs was observed. By acting as a moderator of ROS production,
IPC causes less local and distant injury<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The study of the remote reperfusion injury in the lungs is a relatively new subject,
therefore, without publications that allow us to compare further with the present
results. Dorsa et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> also performed ischemia by aortic clamping and
evaluated the protective effect of IPC, confirming the results presented here that
this method may decrease the degree of lung injury. Another study that obtained
similar results was that of Garbaisz et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>, in which the authors also applied
infrarenal aortic clamping as a method of ischemia and obtained pulmonary protection
with IPC, although using times superior to those presented here for both ischemia
(3h) and for reperfusion (4h). This shows that, for Wistar rats, 70 minutes of IR
are sufficient to produce pulmonary lesions, and no further prolonged experiments
are needed as the used by those authors.</p><p>Szij&#x000e1;rt&#x000f3; et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> also demonstrated IPC protection when IPC was
performed on the lower limbs of rats, with three hours of ischemia and four hours of
reperfusion. Santos et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> also performed mesenteric IR in rats, but used 30
minutes of ischemia and 60 minutes of reperfusion, causing intestinal lesions but
not pulmonary lesions, thus demonstrating that these animals did not present
significant damage to the lungs with these reduced periods of intestinal IR.</p><p>As mentioned, there are few publications aimed at evaluating remote lung damage
against IR, especially using IPC as a protection method. Existing publications point
to a promising role in this method, similar to other IR situations in which IPC
provides tissue protection<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>. Despite this, there are few studies that have used
IPC in clinical practice, which reinforces the importance of finding a
pharmacological method that presents the same or greater efficacy, increasing
interest in safe drugs such as statins and that at least their pleiotropic effect
could be useful in such situations.</p><p>In the present study, pulmonary protection was obtained with the use of atorvastatin,
in the same intensity as with IPC. As there are no studies with the same design used
here, <italic>i.e.</italic> aortic clamping and atorvastatin use, the comparison
with the literature is also impaired. Moreover, since the use of statins for the
prevention of reperfusion injury is relatively new, the best route of administration
and ideal dose are items to be better clarified in future research. Administration
by gavage was chosen here with the intention of simulating what is practiced in
humans, that is, the absorption by the gastrointestinal tract, aiming its clinical
applicability.</p><p>Statins have been successfully tested for this purpose in several situations. Wu et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>
performed renal IR in rats and demonstrated that atorvastatin decreased tissue
injury in the control group. The same results were obtained by Cusumano et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>
in renal IR of rats using atorvastatin.</p><p>Statins also protect other tissues in the presence of IR, such as
heart<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>, nervous system<sup>[<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> and
liver<sup>[<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>. In the lung, the efficiency of statins was also
demonstrated, as published by Matsuo et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>, however, with a method different from
the one used here, since these authors performed IR directly in the pulmonary hilum,
thus not being a study of remote protection. In addition, these authors used
rosuvastatin as a protective medicine and not atorvastatin as in the present
research.</p><p>The mechanism of protection of statins to IR situations is due to its pleiotropic
effect. By inhibiting a conversion of HMG-CoA to L-mevalonate, statins prevent a
synthesis of isoprenoids, which are precursors of cholesterol biosynthesis, which
serve as important lipid ligands for post-translational modification of
intracellular proteins such as small GTPases, Rho, Rac and Ras. This protein
isoprenylation allows a suitable subcellular localization and an intracellular
circuit of proteins, which control various cellular functions, and an inhibition and
pathways are important components of the pleiotropic effects of statins. The Rho
pathway is related to oxidative stress, atherosclerosis and elevated blood pressure,
signaling the pathway between the two crucial mechanisms, such as cytoskeletal
remodeling and the ROS synthesis<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In the development of this project, we did not know that the therapeutic methods
applied would present the results shown here, so that an association group (IPC+A)
was created aiming at enhancing tissue protection. However, there was no advantage
in the association, since, in isolation, these therapeutic methods obtained mean
tissue lesion statistically similar to the SHAM group, <italic>i.e</italic>., it
would not be possible to have a lower lesion than was already achieved. Thus, it can
be verified that atorvastatin has the capacity to protect the lungs in situations of
reperfusion at a distance, at the same intensity as IPC, and it is possible to
invest in research that confirms the best method of using these therapies to apply
them in the clinical practice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>IPC and atorvastatin were able to minimize lung reperfusion injury, alone or in

GPs scored the relevance of nine predefined reasons for 595 referrals from 4350 consecutive consultations on a four-level categorical scale. Associations were examined by multivariable ordered and multivariable multilevel logistic regression analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Medical necessity was assessed as a relevant reason in 93% of the referrals, 43.7% by patient preference, 27.5% to avoid overlooking anything, and 14.6% to reassure the patient. The higher the referral rates, the more frequently the GPs referred to avoid overlooking anything. Female GPs referred to reassure the patient and due to perceived deficient medical knowledge significantly more often than male GPs. However, perceived easy accessibility of specialists was significantly less frequently given as a reason for referral by female GPs compared with male GPs. When the GPs scored the referrals to be of lesser medical necessity, male GPs referred significantly more frequently than female GPs to reassure the patient due to patient preference and perceived deficient medical knowledge.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>There are striking differences in reasons for referral between Norwegian male and female GPs and between GPs with high and low referral rates, which reflects difficulties in handling professional uncertainty. Referring to reassure the patients, especially when referrals are less medically necessary, may reflect consideration and acquiescence towards the patients.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>general practice</kwd><kwd>patient preference</kwd><kwd>referral</kwd><kwd>uncertainty</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The large variation in referral rates to secondary care among GPs is partly unexplained.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Patients&#x02019; age, sex, and morbidity explain less than 40% of the variation, and practice and GP characteristics less than 10%.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Intrinsic psychological variables at GP level are important, but the extent of the contribution is not known.</p><p>The decision-making process for referrals is complex; increased consumerism in health care<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and increased legal rights of patients may increase patients&#x02019; preference for referral. In many countries, GPs are gatekeepers whose job is to manage the demand for secondary care. The decision to refer should be based on the patient&#x02019;s medical condition, needs, and an assessment of the optimal level of health care. The patient should be referred at the right time after adequate pre-referral management, and after an appropriate process that also takes the patient&#x02019;s wishes into account.<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Referrals may have several purposes, including:

Of all 476 GPs (lists) in Northern Norway 88 GPs were excluded, due to the incompatibility of electronic patient records (EPR) with the electronic questionnaire (<italic>n</italic> = 44), vacancy (<italic>n</italic> = 35), the two practices housing three GPs participating in piloting (<italic>n</italic> = 8), and one GP practising without EPR. Assuming there would be a response rate of 50%, a random sample of 104 of the 388 eligible GPs were invited to participate in the study. Background information on patients, GPs, their practice type (private practitioners or salaried), the municipalities, and the healthcare characteristics were collected from the GPs, the Northern Norway Regional Health Authority, and Statistics Norway. Further information on recruitment, data collection, background information, and calculation of referral rates, has been published elsewhere.<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><boxed-text position="float"><sec><title>How this fits in</title><p>The large variation in referral rates to secondary care among GPs is partly unexplained. This study scrutinises GPs&#x02019; reasons for referral at the time of referral, which differs methodologically from most comparable surveys. This study confirms previous research that part of the variation in referral rates reflects how GPs handle professional uncertainty and patient preference. Graduate and postgraduate medical education should incorporate medical decision making in the curriculum to a larger extent and focus more on how to enable GPs to handle professional uncertainty and also shared decision making. This may contribute to decreasing unwarranted variation in clinical practice.</p></sec></boxed-text></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Data collection</title><p>Each GP completed 100 electronic questionnaires from 100 consecutive consultations; the questionnaire appeared on the GP&#x02019;s computer when they closed the EPR for each patient.

The nine reasons for referral were constructed by the authors after communication and group meetings with experienced academic and non-academic GPs. No prior validation of the questionnaire was performed but the comprehensibility, suitability, and technical design were piloted with three GPs.

Independence of the reasons for referral was assessed by Spearman rank-order correlation analyses. Two reasons for referral &#x02014; &#x02018;social security application&#x02019; and &#x02018;to relieve workload&#x02019; &#x02014; were dropped from analyses because some of the levels of scores contained fewer than four observations. Multivariable ordered logistic regression analyses, with calculations of standard errors that allowed for clustering at the GP level, were used to explore the association between scores for each reason for referral, and patient age, patient sex, GP age, GP sex, speciality in family medicine, practice type, travel time to nearest hospital, country where medical degree was obtained, and GPs&#x02019; referral rates.</p><p>One analysis was done for each reason for referral, checking that the assumption of proportional odds was met. Backwards elimination of variables was done when necessary to get statistically significant models. The command Gologit2<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> was used to analyse the association between the scores for the reason &#x02018;to avoid overlooking anything&#x02019; and background variables, because the assumption of proportional odds was not met for the variable &#x02018;GPs&#x02019; referral rate&#x02019;. Gologit2 performs generalised logistic regression for ordinal dependent variables; it can also estimate the partial proportional odds model when some variables do not meet the assumption of proportional odds, as was the case here. Interaction between patient and/or GP characteristics was tested in all analyses of the different reasons for referral. Likewise, interaction between dichotomised scores of medical necessity and GP&#x02019;s characteristics on the other reasons for referral was also tested.</p><p>Multivariable multilevel logistic regression, allowing for clustering at the GP level, was used to explore the association between dichotomised scores of medical necessity of the referral, and dichotomised scores of the other reasons for referral. On an <italic>a posteriori</italic> basis, the reason &#x02018;medically necessary&#x02019; was dichotomised by contrasting the three lowest agreement levels, which implied doubt, with the highest agreement level.

Female GPs referred more often to reassure the patient and due to perceived deficient medical knowledge than males, and high referrers referred more often to avoid overlooking anything than low referrers. Compared to their counterparts, female GPs and low referrers referred less frequently due to accessibility of secondary care specialists. For referrals considered to be less medically necessary, male GPs referred more often due to perceived deficient medical knowledge, to reassure patients, and due to patient preference, compared to female GPs.</p><p>The Spearman rank-order correlation analyses of the reasons for referral displayed an &#x003b1; of 0.55 for the reasons &#x02018;to avoid overlooking anything&#x02019; and &#x02018;to reassure the patient&#x02019;. However, it was decided that these reasons for referral would not be combined because they give specific and different information about the decision-making process.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>A considerable strength of this study is that the questionnaires mandatorily appeared on screen after each consultation. They were also consecutively completed immediately after the consultations, giving a representative sample of patients and referrals. The GPs scored all nine reasons almost immediately after they made the referral decision, which minimised recall bias. The referral data were collected throughout the year, and the participating GPs were all working in ordinary general practices (as opposed to academic or other special types of practice).</p><p>The predetermined reasons for referral in this study particularly explored GPs&#x02019; professional uncertainty, as well as their perception of patients&#x02019; uncertainty and preference for referral. Together, these variables constitute important motives inherent in the decision to refer. It is possible that GPs may have perceived some of the predetermined reasons for referral to be sensitive and been inclined to provide opportunistic scoring, emphasising answers that were &#x02018;professionally correct&#x02019;. However, the fact that this study used a self-administered questionnaire, and that the GPs had to respond to, and balance between, all nine reasons, probably reduced this tendency.<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> A categorical scale with an even number of response categories was chosen; as such, GPs were offered no neutral options that they could choose.</p><p>The pop-up questionnaire was constructed for specific use in general practice and to explore parts of the GPs&#x02019; decision-making process regarding referrals. It was prepared in collaboration with experienced academic and non-academic GPs, and piloted among other GPs. Both responses from the pilot and from the participating GPs in the survey supported the assumption that it was easy to score the different reasons for referral. The authors therefore believe that the content validity of the questionnaire is satisfactory.</p><p>The response rate of 42% raises the concern of selection bias. The responders did not differ from the non-responders with regard to sex. The non-responders were older than the responders and fewer were specialists in family medicine.<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> However, the responders were more comparable to the whole population of GPs in Northern Norway than the non-responders. This study has indications that the non-responders&#x02019; referral rates were slightly higher than the responders&#x02019; (25.6% of the list population per year to hospital outpatient clinics versus 23.4%; personal communication, Center of Clinical Documentation and Evaluation [SKDE], Northern Norway Regional Health Authority, 2011).</p><p>This may indicate that the observed referral rates in this study more probably represent an underestimation. It is not known if the non-responders would have assessed the reasons for referral differently from the responders. Most probably, the differences by GPs&#x02019; referral rate may be underestimated rather than overestimated. Altogether, the authors believe these issues vouch for a reasonable external validity.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with existing literature</title><sec><title>Professional uncertainty and accessibility to secondary care</title><p>Referring a patient to secondary care in order not to overlook anything is a common and legitimate reason for referral.

Nevertheless, many clinicians are unaware of the importance of this element and how it influences their medical decisions.<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>Graduate and postgraduate medical education should incorporate medical decision making in the curriculum to a larger extent, and focus on how to handle professional uncertainty and also shared decision making; to help GPs manage professional uncertainty, inherent in all medical decision making, and improve their process of decision making. This may contribute to decreasing unwarranted variation in clinical practice, particularly regarding referrals. The differences in the relative importance of reasons for referral between male and female GPs and high and low referrers are striking, and reflect difficulties in handling professional uncertainty. Referring to reassure patients, especially in less medically necessary situations, may reflect enhanced consideration and acquiescence towards those patients. Future research should focus on exploring tools that will improve the GPs&#x02019; decision making process and consequently contribute to better results regarding patient outcome, the optimal use of healthcare resources, and GPs&#x02019; job satisfaction.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the responding GPs for their invaluable contribution to this study.</p></ack><notes><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Funding from UiT The Arctic University of Norway and National Centre of Rural Medicine consisted of a salary for PhD stipend for Unni Ringberg, but no grant.

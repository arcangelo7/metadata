The <italic>Ebola response roadmap</italic>, launched on 28 August, came as there was a leap in reported cases of 40% over three weeks and projections that capacity was needed to manage up to 20&#x000a0;000 more cases in the coming months.</p><p>&#x0201c;A massively scaled and coordinated international response is needed to support affected and at-risk countries in intensifying response activities and strengthening national capacities,&#x0201d; the roadmap says, calling for additional donor funding of US$&#x000a0;490 million for the next six months alone.</p><p>The first cases in the current outbreak were reported in Guinea in March, though the outbreak has since been found to date back to December 2013. As of 12&#x000a0;September, 4784 cases had been reported in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the three worst affected countries, and Nigeria and Senegal, which have suffered importations of the virus. With 2400 deaths, this is the largest Ebola virus disease outbreak on record.</p><p>The roadmap calls for the strengthening of laboratory capacity and the public health infrastructure in the affected countries, as well as reinforcements in other areas that are vital to the outbreak response, such as infection prevention and control training.</p><p>It aims to facilitate a huge scale-up in the supply of personal protective equipment, disinfectants and body bags to these countries.</p><p>The new plan builds on months of efforts to stem the outbreak. Government ministers from Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and other African countries and the WHO Director-General, Dr&#x000a0;Margaret Chan, called on the international community for more technical and financial support to stop the outbreak at a meeting from 2&#x000a0;to 3&#x000a0;July in Accra, Ghana.</p><p>At the end of July, an operations centre was established in Conakry, Guinea, to coordinate the outbreak response and the governments launched an initial <italic>Ebola virus disease outbreak response plan</italic> with WHO that outlined the actions that were needed, based on the situation at that time and an estimate of resource requirements. </p><p>Since then the outbreak has spread to Nigeria and Senegal. The 28&#x000a0;August roadmap was informed by many WHO collaborators and partners, including health officials in the affected countries, the African Union, development banks, other United Nations agencies, M&#x000e9;decins Sans Fronti&#x000e8;res, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and countries providing direct financial support.</p><p>It is complemented by a separate United Nations-wide initiative that was launched on 17 September to address other areas such as the delivery of food and other provisions to the affected countries as well as water, sanitation and primary health care.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola">http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola</ext-link>
</p></sec><sec><title>Ukraine health emergency</title><p>The World Health Organization warned on 9&#x000a0;September that the crisis in eastern Ukraine was creating a &#x0201c;looming health emergency&#x0201d;. Hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced and were living &#x0201c;in varying and often exposed conditions as winter approaches, many without official status either as internally displaced persons or as refugees&#x0201d;. </p><p>Since the conflict erupted earlier this year in the east European country, some 262&#x000a0;000 people have registered as internally displaced persons and more than 366&#x000a0;000 have fled as refugees to neighbouring countries, mainly the Russian Federation, as of 12&#x000a0;September, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p><p>At least 32 hospitals in eastern Ukraine have closed down, while 18 that have been shelled and damaged continued to offer limited care, according to the Ukrainian health ministry.</p><p>&#x0201c;The health needs for the people affected by the eastern Ukraine crisis are great and urgent action is needed to treat people who require all manner of care and services, from treatment for noncommunicable diseases and immunizations to the delivery of babies,&#x0201d; said Dr&#x000a0;Dorit Nitzan, WHO Representative to the Ukraine.</p><p>WHO and its partners are responding by providing medical supplies and setting up emergency primary health-care mobile units for the displaced. In collaboration with the Ukrainian authorities, WHO is helping to step up the national early warning system for infectious disease outbreak prevention and control. A vaccination campaign for polio and measles is also planned with UNICEF [the United Nations Children&#x02019;s Fund].</p><p>In mid-August, WHO appealed to donors for US$&#x000a0;14 million to respond to the health emergency in Ukraine.</p></sec><sec><title>Donation for Iraq crisis</title><p>The World Health Organization received US$&#x000a0;49 million from Saudi Arabia &#x02013; a much needed boost for its work responding to the health needs of millions of people affected by the crisis in Iraq. This donation is believed to be the largest ever contribution WHO has received for a specific humanitarian crisis.</p><p>A recent upsurge in violence in June resulted in massive population movement that has placed additional strain on the health system, which is already struggling to address the needs of more than 250&#x000a0;000 Syrian refugees in northern Iraq.</p><p>The donation from Saudi Arabia enables WHO and its partners to scale up its response to disease outbreaks, malnutrition, medicine shortages and overburdened hospitals and clinics, according to Dr&#x000a0;Syed Jaffar Hussain, WHO&#x02019;s Representative to Iraq.</p><p>It will also help WHO and its partners ensure the provision of health services, including emergency obstetric care for expectant mothers, noncommunicable diseases care and psychosocial support to many more people.</p><p>&#x0201c;Humanitarian health-care providers will tackle medical complications resulting from malnutrition by providing targeted support to 350&#x000a0;000 people, including children under five, pregnant and lactating women and patients with severe malnutrition,&#x0201d; said Hussain.</p><p>Last month, WHO announced that despite the ongoing conflict and the resulting violence and displacement across Iraq, a mass polio immunization campaign had reached 3.75&#x000a0;million of 4&#x000a0;million children under the age of five in 13&#x000a0;high-risk governorates.</p><p>The five-day campaign between 10 and 14&#x000a0;August was organized by the Iraqi ministry of health with the support of UNICEF and WHO. Confirmation of two cases of polio in Iraq in February and April of this year ended a 14-year period during which Iraq had been polio free.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/hac/crises/irq/releases/saudi_arabia_support">http://www.who.int/hac/crises/irq/releases/saudi_arabia_support</ext-link>

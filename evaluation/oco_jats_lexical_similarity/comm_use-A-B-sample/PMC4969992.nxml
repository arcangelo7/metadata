However, it is probable &#x02013; although not certain &#x02013; that these and other beverages cause oesophageal cancer when drunk very hot (above 65 degrees Celsius), according to scientists convened by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).

</p></sec><sec><title>Zika and breastfeeding </title><p>Mothers with suspected, probable or confirmed Zika virus infection should continue to breastfeed as there is currently no evidence that the virus can be transmitted in this way to their babies, according to updated WHO guidance.</p><p>The new guideline, released in June, can be used by governments, ministries of health, policy-makers and health-care workers for developing infant feeding policies and protocols on breastfeeding in areas where the Zika virus is circulating. </p><p>The new guideline is based on a WHO-led systematic review of all the evidence on breastfeeding and Zika virus including the evidence from three mother&#x02013;infant pairs. The guideline is an update of an interim guideline that was developed and released by WHO in February of this year. </p><p>Thus, infants born to mothers with suspected, probable or confirmed Zika virus infection or who live in or have travelled to areas where Zika virus is circulating, should be fed according to standard infant feeding guidelines by WHO and the United Nations Children&#x02019;s Fund. </p><p>According to those guidelines, infants should start breastfeeding within one hour of birth, be exclusively breastfed for six months and have timely introduction of adequate, safe and properly-fed complementary foods, while continuing breastfeeding up to two years of age or beyond.</p><p>The Zika virus has been found in breast milk and therefore breast milk could be considered potentially infectious, but there are no documented reports to date of Zika virus being transmitted to infants through breastfeeding.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/208875/1/9789241549660_eng.pdf">http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/208875/1/9789241549660_eng.pdf</ext-link>

Many of the medicines that are available are counterfeit or substandard products, due to weak regulatory control, while standard medicines are expensive and unaffordable. </p><p>Moreover, few Africans are covered by social protection schemes and most people in the region must pay for medicines themselves, which can contribute to impoverishment. </p><p>The goal of universal access to medicines for HIV has not been achieved and generic medicines for other conditions are available in only about 57% of health facilities across the region. </p><p>The new programme has addressed many of these challenges. &#x0201c;The availability of quality medicines in health facilities is improving,&#x0201d; says Dr&#x000a0;Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. </p><p>For example, the Ethiopian government has compiled a list of priority medicines to be covered by the national insurance scheme, marking a major step towards universal health coverage in that country, Moeti said. </p><p>Pricing surveys conducted in Burundi and Mali have led to new legislation that serves to control prices in the private sector and, in turn, reduce out-of-pocket payments for patients. </p><p>Regulators from most of the 15 countries that participated in the four-year programme took part in training workshops to acquire additional skills to assess and register medicines more efficiently.</p><p>In addition, Ethiopia and Mozambique are now screening more effectively for substandard and counterfeit products at ports of entry into the country, using improved detection techniques such as minilabs, Moeti told the meeting. </p><p>National essential medicines lists in several of these countries have also been updated in line with the most recent evidence thus including more medicines for noncommunicable diseases and for children.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.afro.who.int/en/clusters-a-programmes/hss/essential-medicines.html">http://www.afro.who.int/en/clusters-a-programmes/hss/essential-medicines.html</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>Pesticide residues in food </title><p>New residue limits for more than 30 different pesticides in various foods have been adopted by the Codex Alimentarius Commission, the United Nations food standards body.</p><p>Pesticides are chemicals used to kill insects to prevent them from damaging crops. Pesticide residues often remain in food, such as grains, fruits and vegetables. </p><p>To protect people&#x02019;s health from high levels of such residues, the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and WHO Expert Meeting on Pesticide Residues, (JMPR), a group of independent international specialists, assessed the risks to human health posed by 30 pesticides.</p><p>Based on this health risk assessment and identification of safe exposure levels, the Codex Alimentarius Commission recommended specific limits for each pesticide-food combination at its 39th Session held in Rome at the end of June.</p><p>The Codex Alimentarius Commission, which is jointly run by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and WHO, sets international food safety and quality standards to promote safer and more nutritious food for consumers worldwide. </p><p>Codex standards serve in many cases as a basis for national legislation and provide the food safety benchmarks for international food trade.</p><p>Codex safety standards are based on a scientific assessment of all the available evidence. The JMPR is an international scientific expert group administered jointly by the FAO and WHO. The JMPR has met regularly since 1963 to review residues and analytical aspects of the pesticides, estimate the maximum residue levels, review toxicological data and estimate acceptable daily intakes for humans of the pesticides under consideration.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/foodsafety/areas_work/food-standard/CAC">http://www.who.int/foodsafety/areas_work/food-standard/CAC</ext-link>

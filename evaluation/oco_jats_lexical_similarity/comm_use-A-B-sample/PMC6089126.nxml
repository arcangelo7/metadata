sudden-onset chest pain. In his medical history he had coronary artery disease for
five years and a CABG surgery was recommended for him in another healthcare centre
one year before. The stenosis in the right internal carotid artery was observed in
the preoperative carotid Doppler ultrasonography. The patient was then diagnosed
with Moyamoya disease based on subsequent cranial computed tomography and cerebral
digital subtraction angiographic (DSA) images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure
1</xref>). In the DSA scans obtained from the previous institution, the stenosis
of the right internal carotid artery extended to the distal ophthalmic branch was
observed. Due to the low blood flow in the right middle cerebral artery (MCA), CABG
was considered risky for causing cerebral hypoperfusion so their treatment plan was
revised to the placement of a coronary stent into the main circumflex artery.</p><p>

internal carotid arterial injection revealed a normal middle and

arterial injection revealed a stenosis involving the distal ophthalmic
branch without any blood flow in the right middle and anterior cerebral
arteries.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-33-03-0309-g01"/></fig>
</p><p>During his evaluation in our center, the ejection fraction was calculated as 48% and
the basal, mid-basal posterior and anterior segments of the interventricular septum
were hypokinetic. Emergent coronary angiography showed 100% stenosis in the left
anterior descending artery and the stent previously placed was patent in the main
circumflex artery, while 50% stenosis was observed in the second obtuse marginal
artery, followed by 100% stenosis in the main circumflex artery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). We decided to perform an elective CABG
surgery as a treatment option for the patient, according to the results of the
previous examinations.Preoperative written informed consent was obtained from the
patient for open heart surgery.</p><p>

</p><p>Under general anesthesia, the patient received continuous esmolol infusion (50
&#x000b5;g/kg/min). The surgery was performed with off-pump beating heart technique
and the heart was stabilized using Octopus(r) (Medtronic Inc, Minneapolis, USA)
tissue stabilizers. The left internal mammary graft was anastomosed to the left
anterior descending artery and a saphenous vein graft was anastomosed sequentially
to the second obtuse marginal artery without any intraoperative complication. The
patient was transferred to the cardiovascular intensive care unit under positive
inotropic support (5 &#x000b5;g/kg/min Dopamine). The patient was, then, successfully
extubated and discharged on the sixth day after the surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Moyamoya disease is a progressive, occlusive cerebrovascular disease without any
known etiology which is mostly seen in the Northeast Asian
countries<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>.</p><p>The disease is characterized by the occlusion or spontaneous bilateral stenosis of
the terminal portion of the internal carotid artery<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. Transient or permanent
cerebral ischemic conditions are typically seen in the childhood, while hemorrhagic
diseases are seen in the adulthood<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. As a result, Moyamoya disease may present with
distinct clinical presentations according to the age of the affected
individual<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, there are three cases of Moyamoya disease operated with
off-pump CABG technique. One of these cases was a 51-year-old Japanese female
patient in whom angioplasty was performed for the left anterior descending artery
stenosis, followed by elective left anterior mini thoracotomy and minimally invasive
direct CABG due to the heart ischemia as assessed by the exercise stress test at 28
weeks of follow-up<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. The other cases were a 56-year-old Korean female
patient in whom off-pump three-vessel CABG was performed one year before the
diagnosis of Moyamoya disease<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup><sup>]</sup> and a 48-year-old Japanese female patient in
whom off-pump CABG was performed with the support of intra-aortic balloon pump
(IABP) due to the left main coronary lesion<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. Due to the low number of cases and
limited intraoperative data, it is challenging to discuss the prevention methods for
cerebral ischemia in Moyamoya disease. Prevention of cerebral ischemia in off-pump
technique can be achieved by maintaining the systemic blood pressure over 80 mmHg.
In addition, some authors reported the use of IABP to prevent cerebral diseases in
patients with Moyamoya disease undergoing CABG<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>.</p><p>In the present case of Moyamoya disease, we believe off-pump two-vessel CABG provided
a safe approach most probably by preventing CPB-related hypotensive cerebral
ischemia. We think this type of management may provide effective prevention of
intraoperative and postoperative complications.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="5%" span="1"/><col width="95%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">EC</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Substantial contributions to the

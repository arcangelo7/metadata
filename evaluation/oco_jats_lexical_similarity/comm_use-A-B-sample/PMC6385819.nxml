vasculitis involving the small- and medium-sized blood vessels and it frequently
involves the distal part of the extremities. The disease causes a tightening or
blockage in distal limb arteries. It usually appears in middle-aged male smokers,
besides disease remissions and relapses are correlated with
smoking<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>BD begins with claudication of the upper and lower limbs. As the disease progresses,
superficial thrombophlebitis, Raynaud's phenomena, limb claudication, rest pain,
ischemic ulcerations, or gangrene in the distal limbs may also develop. Although
coronary artery occlusion in Buerger's disease is a rare condition, to the best of
our knowledge, coronary artery dissection has not been described previously yet.</p><p>Accordingly, in this paper, we have presented a 45-year-old man who developed
coronary artery dissection associated with BD. The patient was successfully treated
with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with the left internal mammary artery
(LIMA) to the left anterior descending (LAD) artery, and saphenous vein graft to the
right coronary artery (RCA).</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>CASE REPORT</title><p>A 45-year-old man with a previous diagnosis of BD for two years was admitted to the
emergency department due to acute chest pain. The patient had no history of diabetes
mellitus, hyperlipidemia or hypertension, while he had 25 pack-year history of
smoking.</p><p>There was total occlusion of the right superficial femoral artery on computed
tomography scan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). His
electrocardiogram revealed a significant ST segment elevation on anterior
derivations. Cardiac troponin (7.263 ng/mL, 0-0.1 ng/mL) and creatine kinase-MB (63
U/L, 0-25 U/L) levels were elevated. After the patient was transferred to the
coronary care unit with the diagnosis of acute anterior myocardial infarction, an
emergent coronary angiography was performed. Coronary angiography demonstrated
coronary dissection in the LAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p><fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Computed tomography angiography. 3D reconstruction image demonstrates a

using the LIMA to LAD and the saphenous vein for RCA surgery. The intimal dissection
originated from the LAD was observed intraoperatively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). Five days after surgery, the patient was discharged after an
uneventful hospital stay.</p><p><fig id="f3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Intraoperative image illustrates the intimal dissection originated from

adolescence to middle age, as in our case. However, recent studies have reported an
increasing incidence of BD in women and in people over 50 years of age. The
underlying cause of BD is unknown, nonetheless, there is a strong relationship
between tobacco use and disease development. BD begins with a decrease in blood flow
in the distal small vessels, with progressive involvement of the more proximal
vasculature. Studies have reported that the involvement of distal parts of the limbs
is much more than other sites, such as coronary, cerebral, intestinal artery and/or
vein. Although coronary artery occlusion in BD is very unusual and rarely reported,
coronary artery dissection has not been previously described.</p><p>When we reviewed the literature regarding coronary involvement, very few reports were
found. Hoppe et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> described a 39-year-old female with BD who presented
with acute myocardial infarction. Coronary angiogram of the patient revealed
obstructive epicardial coronary artery disease. Histological examination of the
specimen was consistent with thromboangiitis obliterans. Similarly, Becit et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>
reported a 36-year-old man with BD who was treated with CABG. The endarterectomy
specimen has shown characteristic findings of inflammatory vasculitis. Moreover,
Mautner et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> reported a review of a case series considering the
histopathologic evaluation of the coronary arteries whereby atherosclerosis is the
predominant histological finding, with the coexistence of lesions consistent with
BD. On the other hand, our patient presented with acute myocardial infarction and
spontaneous LAD dissection.</p><p>Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a rare condition that can lead to
myocardial infarction and even can be fatal. It is defined as a non-traumatic and
non-iatrogenic separation of the coronary vessel walls, forming a false
lumen<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. Although the pathological mechanism of SCAD is
still unknown, several clinical conditions, such as atherosclerosis, peripartum
period, drugs, heavy exercise, fibromuscular dysplasia, systemic inflammatory
disease, and connective tissue disease, have been associated with
SCAD<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>. To our best knowledge, coronary artery dissection
in BD has not been previously described in the literature. In our case, coronary
dissection was detected in the LAD artery, and coronary occlusion in the RCA.
Regarding the cause for SCAD, presence of segmental vasculitis and increased
vascular stress area are plausible hypothesis to explain the coronary artery
dissection. The pathological mechanism leading to acute (neutrophilic infiltration
involving the thrombus) or chronic (the thrombus with predominantly mononuclear
infiltration and fibrosis) inflammation of the vessels may lead to a predisposition
to spontaneous dissections in BD<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, by presenting our unusual case, we would like to draw attention to the
fact that coronary artery dissection should be taken into account for the
differential diagnosis of acute chest pain in patients with BD. Since the coronary
artery dissection leads to sudden death, prompt diagnosis and management are of
paramount importance. In this context, CABG seems to be a convenient treatment
method, as in our case. Further studies considering the histopathologic changes of
the coronary arteries in BD are awaited in order to provide the underlying mechanism
of dissection.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="5%" span="1"/><col width="95%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">A&#x00130;T</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Substantial contributions to the

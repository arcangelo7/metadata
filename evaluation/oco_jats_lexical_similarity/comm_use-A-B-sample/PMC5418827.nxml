These types of weapons are banned by international law because they represent an intolerable barbarism,&#x0201d; said Dr Peter Salama, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme.</p><p>Since 2012, when the first reports emerged of the use of chemicals as weapons in the Syrian conflict, WHO has been engaged in public health preparedness for the management of patients exposed to chemical or toxic gas. </p><p>This included issuing new clinical management protocols, preparing hospitals to receive and treat patients, distributing protective equipment to hospitals, and raising awareness amongst Syrians on how they can protect themselves against exposure and when to seek treatment. </p><p>In 2016, WHO trained 200 clinicians on the initial management of chemical weapons cases including pre-hospital decontamination, referral, triage and treatment. </p><p>An additional 65 doctors in northern Syrian were trained by WHO&#x02019;s field office in Gaziantep, southern Turkey. The majority of doctors trained were from Idleb, the governorate where the 5 April attack took place. </p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2017/toxic-chemicals-syria/">http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2017/toxic-chemicals-syria/</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>Aiming for zero malaria cases</title><p>The World Health Organization released new policy guidance last month to aid programme managers in their development of national strategic plans for the elimination of malaria.</p><p>A framework for malaria elimination provides countries with a set of tools and strategies for achieving and maintaining elimination, regardless of where they lie across the continuum of transmission.</p><p>Malaria is a potentially fatal disease caused by parasites transmitted to people through the bites of infected female <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes. In 2015, 91 countries and areas had ongoing malaria transmission.</p><p>The framework, which supersedes the 2007 malaria elimination field manual, was developed through a broad, consultative process led by the WHO Secretariat and an independent 13-member evidence review group of international experts from diverse fields.</p><p>Several countries have recently eliminated the disease, including Kyrgyzstan, the Maldives and Sri Lanka.</p><p>In addition, 21 countries are on track to reduce malaria transmission to zero by 2020 and are being supported by WHO to achieve this target.</p><p>WHO certification of malaria elimination requires that local transmission of all human malaria parasites has been interrupted nationwide, resulting in zero incidence of indigenous cases for at least three consecutive years. The certification process has been streamlined, and is described in the new framework.</p><p>In addition, the concept of subnational verification of malaria elimination has been introduced in the new malaria guidance and is an option for large countries that have achieved interruption of local transmission in certain parts of the country.</p><p>Subnational verification can be an important building block for future national certification.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/atoz/9789241511988">http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/atoz/9789241511988</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>WHO ethics guidance for TB</title><p>New tuberculosis ethics guidance was launched ahead of World TB Day on 24 March by the World Health Organization.</p><p>The guidance can be used by governments, health workers, care providers, nongovernmental organizations, researchers and others implementing the End TB Strategy.</p><p>The aim is to make all tuberculosis stakeholders aware of their responsibilities, in terms of adhering to sound ethical standards and protecting the rights of those affected.</p><p>Protecting human rights, ethics and equity are principles which underpin WHO&#x02019;s End TB Strategy. But it is not easy to apply these principles on the ground. Patients, communities, health workers, policy-makers and other stakeholders frequently face conflicts and ethical dilemmas. The current multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) crisis and the health security threat it poses accentuate the situation even further.</p><p>Poverty, malnutrition, poor housing and sanitation, compounded by other risk factors such as HIV, tobacco, alcohol use and diabetes, can put people at heightened risk of tuberculosis and make it harder for them to access care.</p><p>The new WHO ethics guidance addresses contentious issues including the isolation of contagious patients, the rights of tuberculosis patients in prison and discriminatory policies against migrants affected by tuberculosis.</p><p>It emphasizes five key ethical obligations to: provide patients with social support; to refrain from isolating tuberculosis patients before exhausting all options to enable treatment adherence and only under very specific conditions; enable key populations to access the same standard of care offered to other citizens; ensure that all health workers operate in a safe environment; rapidly share evidence from research to inform national and global tuberculosis policy updates.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2017/world-tb-day">http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2017/world-tb-day</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>Health care in South Sudan</title><p>South Sudan launched a new community health initiative last month.

Medication-related harm will be measured in terms of medication-related hospital admissions, readmissions and deaths. </p><p>A WHO Working Group on Monitoring and Evaluation has been set up under the Third WHO Global Patient Safety Challenge on medication safety, comprising international multidisciplinary experts in patient safety to track progress towards this goal. </p><p>The challenge primarily aims to improve ordering, prescribing, dispensing, administering and monitoring of medications. WHO will provide guidance and develop strategies, plans and tools that countries can use to make the medication process safer. </p><p>This is WHO&#x02019;s third global patient safety challenge, following the Clean Care is Safe Care challenge on hand hygiene in 2005 and the Safe Surgery Saves Lives challenge in 2008.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2017/medication-related-errors">http://who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2017/medication-related-errors</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>Reporting on health systems</title><p>A portrait of the health system in the world&#x02019;s fourth most populous country, Indonesia, was released last month by the Asia Pacific Observatory on Health Systems.</p><p>The Health in Transition (HiT) report on Indonesia highlights recent efforts to increase health-care coverage with the introduction of the National Health Insurance Scheme in 2014.</p><p>The goal is to achieve universal health coverage by 2019 in this country of some 257 million people spread across about 900 permanently inhabited islands with significant devolution of authority to provinces and districts.</p><p>Other reports in the series are on: Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Fiji, Lao People&#x02019;s Democratic Republic, New Zealand, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Philippines, Republic of Korea, Solomon Islands, Thailand and Tonga.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wpro.who.int/asia_pacific_observatory/hits/latest_hits">http://www.wpro.who.int/asia_pacific_observatory/hits/latest_hits</ext-link></p><boxed-text id="Bc" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Looking ahead</title></caption><p>10&#x02013;12 May &#x02013; High-Level eHealth Conference, Malta.

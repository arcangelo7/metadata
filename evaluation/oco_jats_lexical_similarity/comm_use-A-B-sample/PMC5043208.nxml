It also increases the risks for acute respiratory infections and exacerbates asthma. </p><p>Reducing air pollution has double benefits: it reduces carbon emissions and other toxic air particles that lead to 6.5 million deaths each year and it helps to reduce global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change.</p><p>Hundreds of people from governments, civil society, science and the private sector are set to gather at the Habitat III conference from 17 to20&#x000a0;October to agree on an urban development agenda to make cities economically vibrant, environmentally sustainable and socially equitable. </p><p>The conference is held every 20 years; the last event took place in Istanbul, Turkey in 1996. </p></sec><sec><title>Emergency in Nigeria</title><p>WHO, with its partners, is scaling up its emergency health response to the humanitarian crisis in north eastern Nigeria, where some 3.7 million displaced people are in desperate need of health services.</p><p>A recent WHO rapid assessment of 56 health facilities in the Nigerian state of Borno found dire shortages of medicines and other supplies, especially for paediatric, emergency obstetric and antenatal care.</p><p>The health facilities are struggling to provide services to some 1.3 million displaced people in Borno state, formerly held by militant insurgency groups, the assessment found.</p><p>Stronger disease surveillance is urgently needed to allow for the early detection of infectious diseases. </p><p>WHO is working with the Government of Nigeria and partners to quickly re-establish and strengthen early warnings for disease outbreaks to allow for more rapid responses. </p><p>To prevent potential outbreaks, WHO has supported the establishment of an early warning alert and response system in the 56 health facilities. </p><p>WHO also provided training on how to use the system for more than 80 health professionals.</p><p>&#x0201c;Our immediate goal is to reduce the rates of death and disease by rapidly scaling up life-saving health services in spite of continued insecurity,&#x0201d; said Rob Holden, Nigeria Emergency Coordinator from WHO&#x02019;s Health Emergencies Programme.</p><p>A third round of emergency polio vaccination was completed in northern Nigeria last month after an outbreak of the disease was declared a national and regional public health emergency.</p><p>The third vaccination round covered 11 states in northern Nigeria that are at high risk of renewed polio transmission, as well as other states. A fourth round is planned for later this month. </p><p>WHO is working closely with the federal and state ministries and with many health partners to quickly dispatch medicine and supplies to the vulnerable population in Borno state.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/emergencies/nigeria/">http://www.who.int/emergencies/nigeria/</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>Yellow fever vaccination in Kinshasa</title><p>More than seven million people were immunized against yellow fever with reduced doses of the vaccine in Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), in a huge emergency vaccination campaign.</p><p>The campaign was rolled out within the space of two weeks in August to curb the spread of the disease before the onset of the rainy season in the southern African country in September.</p><p>The health ministry led the campaign with support from WHO and global partners, based on advice from WHO&#x02019;s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) that fractionation could be used as a short-term emergency measure to reach more people, given the shortage of vaccine supplies.</p><p>The SAGE cited evidence that a fifth of a standard vaccine dose provides protection against the disease for at least 12 months.</p><p>About 10 million syringes were shipped to the country and more than 40&#x000a0;000 vaccinators were trained in fractionation.</p><p>The campaign came months after a yellow fever outbreak started in neighbouring Angola in December 2015 and spread to DRC earlier this year.</p><p><underline><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/emergencies/yellow-fever/">http://www.who.int/emergencies/yellow-fever/</ext-link></underline></p><boxed-text id="Bc" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Cover photo</title></caption><p>This month&#x02019;s cover photo shows a mother holding her four-month-old baby born with microcephaly in Recife, Brazil.

But, according to the new report, average annual public expenditure on health in the region in 2014 was only 10% of total public spending and less than half of that goes to priority health services, such as primary care and maternal and child health.</p><p>The report reviews the main trends in public financing for health over the past 15 years in the African region.</p><p>It argues that increasing public budgets is not enough to make progress towards universal health coverage, but that appropriately targeted health budget allocations and full execution of public health budgets and improved efficiency are essential.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/health_financing/documents/public-financing-africa/">http://www.who.int/health_financing/documents/public-financing-africa/</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>UN report on access to medicines</title><p>A binding international treaty on research and development that delinks prices from research and development (R&#x00026;D) costs is needed to make medicines and other health technologies more accessible, according to a report by the United Nations Secretary General High-Level Panel on Access to Medicines. </p><p>In its report<italic/>that was<italic/>submitted to the UN Secretary General on 12 September, the panel called for the creation of new bodies to take this and its other recommendations forward.</p><p>The panel urged governments to make better use of World Trade Organization rules to increase access to affordable medicines and increase transparency in the costs of research and development. </p><p>United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon convened the panel in November 2015 &#x0201c;to review and assess proposals and recommend solutions for remedying the policy incoherence between the justifiable rights of inventors, international human rights law, trade rules and public health in the context of health technologies.&#x0201d; </p><p>

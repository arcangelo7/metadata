Previous such meetings were on HIV, noncommunicable diseases and Ebola.</p><p>Participants are expected to address the urgent need to take action and to agree on sustainable, multisectoral approaches to addressing the problem of antimicrobial resistance.</p><p>Last year the World Health Organization (WHO) released a report showing that only 34 of the 133 countries that responded to a WHO survey in 2013&#x02013;2014 had comprehensive national plans to fight resistance to antibiotics and other antimicrobial medicines and even fewer already had systems in place to combat the problem.</p><p>The survey findings were presented in the report, <italic>Worldwide country situation analysis: response to antimicrobial resistance</italic>.</p><p>&#x0201c;Fortunately, Member States are making progress on their obligation to have national action plans in place by May 2017. The UN General Assembly meeting should result in high-level political commitment that will support countries in the global effort to stop AMR,&#x0201d; said Dr Keiji Fukuda, Special Representative of the Director-General on AMR.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/drugresistance/events/UNGA-meeting-amr-sept2016/">http://www.who.int/drugresistance/events/UNGA-meeting-amr-sept2016/</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>Cholera in South Sudan</title><p>A vaccination campaign got under way last month in South Sudan to stop a deadly outbreak of cholera. </p><p>The health ministry, with support from WHO and other partners, has been ramping up disease surveillance, treatment and prevention efforts since July, when the cholera outbreak was confirmed. </p><p>The campaign aims to reach more than 14 000 people with the oral cholera vaccine in the high risk areas of Juba county in the conflict-torn country, as it faces one of the world&#x02019;s most severe humanitarian emergencies. </p><p>A national cholera taskforce is coordinating efforts to stop the spread of the disease. </p><p>It includes the health ministry, WHO, the United Nations Children&#x02019;s Fund (UNICEF), M&#x000e9;decins Sans Fronti&#x000e8;res (MSF) and other health and water, sanitation and hygiene organizations that are part of the United Nations humanitarian cluster system. </p><p>Cholera treatment centres have been set up at Juba Teaching Hospital and United Nations House civilian protection site by MSF, the health ministry and WHO; and 13 oral rehydration points have been established in Juba by Health Link South Sudan with support from partners including WHO to improve access to timely rehydration. </p><p>WHO has distributed cholera preparedness and response guidelines to improve case detection and treatment of cholera.</p><p>Cholera is an acute diarrhoeal disease that causes massive loss of body fluids and can be deadly within hours if not adequately treated. </p><p>&#x0201c;WHO is taking all the necessary control measures to support the Ministry of Health to respond to the situation urgently, and put an end to this outbreak,&#x0201d; said Dr Abdulmumini Usman, WHO Representative to South Sudan.</p><p>&#x0201c;This work is vital because the conditions are favourable for transmitting the disease. These include increased population displacement, overcrowding, unsafe water, poor hygiene and sanitation,&#x0201d; he said. </p><p>WHO and partners are also supporting social mobilization and community engagement activities. The media is currently airing cholera prevention messages and a toll-free phone line to report cholera cases has been activated. </p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://who.int/emergencies/south-sudan">http://who.int/emergencies/south-sudan</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>Taking action on NCDs</title><p>A new WHO reports calls on governments to step up action to protect people from noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), especially heart disease, cancers, diabetes and lung diseases that are responsible for most deaths in people under 70 years of age.</p><p>According to the report entitled <italic>Assessing national capacity for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases</italic> some countries are making progress in moving closer to achieving the sustainable development goals and others are lagging behind.</p><p>The findings of the report are based on a survey to which 177 of WHO&#x02019;s 194 Member States responded. Some 93% (164) of countries that responded said they had a unit, branch or department responsible for NCDs within their ministry of health and that 91% (161) had a full-time technical or professional staff member working on this. </p><p>The report commended countries that have taken key public health measures, for example, to protect people from exposure to tobacco use, harmful use of alcohol, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity. </p><p>The report also tracks progress on four time-bound commitments agreed in 2014 to strengthen countries&#x02019; abilities to tackle NCDs: to set national NCD reduction targets; to develop national multisectoral policies and plans to achieve these national targets; to reduce exposure to risk factors for NCDs; and to strengthen health systems to address NCDs.</p><p>To date, 60% (106) of countries have set national time-bound targets for NCD indicators and 92% (162) have integrated NCDs into their national health plans.</p><p>Respondents said that their top health funding priorities were health care and treatment (94%; 166 countries), followed by primary prevention of NCDs (88%; 156 countries) and early detection and screening (85%; 151 countries).</p><p>Just over a third (34%; 60) of countries reported having an operational national multisectoral commission, agency or mechanism to oversee NCD engagement, policy coherence and accountability of sectors beyond health, while 53% (93) of countries reported having an operational, multisectoral national policy, strategy or action plan that integrates several NCDs and their risk factors.</p><p>Nearly a quarter of countries (24%; 43) had not conducted a recent national adult risk factor survey.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/ncds/events/action-on-ncds/">http://www.who.int/ncds/events/action-on-ncds/</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>Building laboratory capacity in Africa</title><p>A new international initiative was launched in July to make tuberculosis diagnostics more widely available in African countries, especially for HIV-associated and drug-resistant tuberculosis.</p><p>The burden of tuberculosis, including multidrug-resistant forms, is high, while the prevalence of tuberculosis and HIV co-infection is about 34% in southern and eastern African countries.</p><p>Laboratories need to be able to detect tuberculosis in all its forms rapidly and accurately, so that patients can be given prompt and appropriate treatment.</p><p>The Global Laboratory Initiative for Africa (GLI Africa) was launched to support countries in the WHO African Region to achieve quality-assured, accessible and sustainable tuberculosis laboratory services. </p><p>This first GLI Africa workshop was organized in July in Uganda and brought together representatives of National Tuberculosis Control Programmes and National Tuberculosis Reference Laboratories from more than 20 African countries, technical partners, multilateral agencies, donors and other key stakeholders. </p><p>The workshop identified key priorities for strengthening tuberculosis diagnostic networks in Africa and participants drafted the Kampala Declaration, which describes the next steps needed to strengthen tuberculosis diagnostic networks on the continent and affirms the role of GLI Africa as a partnership that can drive these steps forward.</p><p>Uganda has made considerable progress in building laboratory capacity in recent years.</p><p>The Uganda National TB Laboratory was accredited by WHO to become a supranational laboratory in 2013, giving the laboratory a mandate to support laboratory capacity building efforts in 11 African countries.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.afro.who.int/en/uganda/press-materials/item/8847-global-laboratory-initiative-to-build-capacity-in-africa.html">http://www.afro.who.int/en/uganda/press-materials/item/8847-global-laboratory-initiative-to-build-capacity-in-africa.html</ext-link></p><boxed-text id="Bb" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Cover photo</title></caption><p>This month&#x02019;s cover photo shows cattle grazing in the United Republic of Tanzania.

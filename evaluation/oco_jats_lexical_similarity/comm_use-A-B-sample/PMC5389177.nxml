Southeast-Asian countries share a big burden of burn injuries, and Nepal is not an exception. We performed a systemic review to examine the epidemiological characteristics of burn injures in Nepal. Relevant epidemiological studies were identified through systemic search in PubMed, EMBASE, and Google Scholar. Reference lists from relevant review articles were also searched. Studies were included if they meet our selection criteria. Eight studies were included in our systemic review. Most of the burn victims belong to the working age group between 15&#x02013;60&#x000a0;years old. Flame burns were found to be the most common cause of burn injury followed by scald burns, whereas scald burns were the most common cause of burn injury among the pediatric population. Most patients sustained less severe burn injuries, with home being the most common place of burn injury. The average hospital stay among the burn victims ranged from 13 to 60&#x000a0;days. Mortality among the burn victims ranged from 4.5 to 23.5%, with highest mortality among the flame burn patients. Developed nations have significantly reduced the burn incidence through effective intervention program. Although, burn injuries are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Nepal, effective intervention programs are lacking due to the limited epidemiological data related to burn injuries. Further large scale research is imperative to investigate the problem and assess the effectiveness of an intervention program.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Burns</kwd><kwd>Nepal</kwd><kwd>Epidemiology</kwd><kwd>Injury</kwd><kwd>Systemic review</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Burn injuries are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Burn injuries perhaps represent the widest spectrum of any form of trauma. Burns occur in all age groups and may range in severity from very minor requiring no treatment to extremely severe requiring highest level of intensive treatment.</p><p>Burn is a public health problem, accounting for an estimated 265,000 deaths annually throughout the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The burden of burn is unevenly distributed throughout the world. The majority of these deaths occur in low-&#x000a0;and middle-income countries (LMIC), and almost half occur in South-East Asia region including Nepal. Burns are among the leading causes of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost in LMIC. Burns are the third most common cause of injury in Nepal followed by fall injuries and road traffic accidents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. There is no factual report about the incidence of burn injuries in Nepal, but Nepal government estimates that there were 55,000 burn cases and 2100 deaths in 2008. Experts believe that the incidence of burn injuries and death rate are far more than the estimated figure. Lack of national burn registry makes this calculation very challenging. Five percent of disabilities at all age group in Nepal are due to burns related injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The high burden of burn injuries and lack of adequate epidemiological data makes it challenging for the policy makers to implement a proper strategic plan for burn prevention.</p><p>The epidemiological study is prerequisite for planning and implementing prevention program in the community. High income countries are able to reduce the burn incidence and mortality through proper epidemiological research and utilizing the information for planning preventive strategies. However, different strategic planning is required based on the cultural and socio-economic status of the region. The programs which are successful in developed countries might not be translated in developing countries. The purpose of this review is to identify the demographics, mechanism of injury, associated risk factors, and outcome of burn injury in Nepal. Being the first systemic review of burn injuries from Nepal, this information will be useful for policy makers and clinicians to further understand the epidemiological characteristics of burn injury in Nepal and also identify the research questions to be answered.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Review</title><p>We conducted a comprehensive literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Google Scholar&#x000a0;using the keywords &#x0201c;burns, epidemiology, Nepal, injury, flame burn, scald burn, electric burn, chemical burn, and contact burn&#x0201d;. Additional articles were identified by reviewing reference lists. The local journals were searched for the articles not indexed in PubMed or EMBASE. The inclusion criteria for the article were (1) articles which studied epidemiological characteristics of burn injury from Nepal, (2) only published articles were included in our study, and (3) only English language articles were included in our study. Articles were excluded if they fail to present the data for extraction, and also, the case studies were not included in our review.</p><p>The data were extracted from each study into an excel spreadsheet and further evaluation were done by two authors. The formal meta-analysis was not performed due to the large degree of clinical heterogeneity between the study populations. We followed the MOOSE guidelines while performing this review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>The database search elicited 106 articles.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This systemic review summarizes the epidemiological characteristics of burn injuries in Nepal as reported by 8 different studies, which includes 1710 patients over the period of 17&#x000a0;years. Although most studies were conducted in Kathmandu (Capital), the patients were represented from all over Nepal because the burn patients requiring surgery are referred to Kathmandu for further management from all over the country.</p><p>Burn injuries are among the leading causes of injury in Nepal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Flame burns were the most common cause of burn injuries in Nepal, followed by scald burns. Two systemic reviews of epidemiology of burn injuries in South Asia and East Mediterranean region have also reported flame burn being the most common cause of burn injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Flame burns were associated with considerably higher body surface area burn, and more females were found to sustain flame burns compared to males. In Nepalese culture, females are responsible for daily household activities like cooking. This is the reason that more females sustain flame burn compared to males. Furthermore, many household in Nepal use traditional open fire for cooking purpose which further increase the risk of burn injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Among the pediatric patients, scald burns were the most common cause of burn injury. Other studies also reported scalds as the most common cause of burn injury among the pediatric population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Although the mortality rate is low in pediatric group, they are more susceptible for developing disability caused by burn injuries. Study by Sharma et al. reported electric burns as the second most common cause of burn injury, this might be caused because their study consists of fewer pediatric population who are more susceptible for scald burns&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. One study in Bangladesh found that 2% of pediatric burn victims were permanently disabled, estimating a disability rate of 5.7 per 100,000 children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The study from Nepal reported that 5% of disability in all age group is due to burn injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Although house is considered to be a safe place, most burn injuries occurred inside the house itself, mostly occurring in kitchen. The use of open fire for cooking, wearing loose fitting cloths like saree, and poorly regulated LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) cylinders increase the risk of burn injuries in the Nepalese population. Our review indicates that time escape between burn injury and initiation of proper burn treatment significantly increases the morbidity and mortality among the burn victims. Nepal is a mountainous country where many parts are not linked by transportation, many burn victims from these regions could never make to hospital, and even if they make to hospital, they are presented very late complicating the treatment. In Nepal, limited number of burn center and trained physician make it difficult for burn victims to get proper treatment immediately after the injury. Burn patients in most centers are managed by general physician or general surgeon. Patient lost their golden hour for treatment being referred from one hospital to another hospital for burn management.</p><p>Mortality of burn victims in Nepal is comparable to findings from other LMIC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].The highest mortality rate in our study was 23.5%, and the lowest was 4.5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].The high mortality rate in Liu et al. study might be caused due to various reasons like the flame burn was the most common cause of burn injury which tends to burn more body surface area, 31.8% of patients presented more than 1&#x000a0;week after injury, and lack of well-trained physician and resources for burn treatment at the center [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. On the other hand, low burn mortality of 4.5% in the&#x000a0;study by Shrestha et al. might be due to the fact that this study was conducted in pediatric population where scald burns were the most common cause of injury which tends to be less severe&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, most of the patients were brought to hospital within 24&#x000a0;h after injury. The mortality rate in developed country is very low compared to LMIC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].The factors contributing to high mortality in Nepal compared to developed nations are lack of proper first-aid measures, time lost between the injury, and initiation of proper treatment, poor economic status, and malnutrition among the general population.</p><p>Female patients and increased %TBSA were significant risk factor for the mortality in different studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. More females sustained flame burns compared to male patients, and flame burns were associated with increased %TBSA burn, which may be a reason for higher mortality among the female patient compared to males. Other studies from LMICs also coincide with the finding that mortality increases with increasing %TBSA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The mortality rate for patient with more than 40%TBSA burns almost approaches 100% in Nepal. This is unimaginable in developed countries, but it is a normal scenario in most of the developing countries around the world. Most burn patients in Nepal are from low socio-economic status unable to afford the expensive burn treatment. Furthermore, lack of skin substitute to cover the excised burn wound makes the treatment more challenging in these settings. Additionally, prevalence of malnutrition among these populations further worsens the situation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec12"><title>Strengths and limitations of the study</title><p>This review of the epidemiological characteristics of burn injury in Nepal is the first systemic review from Nepal which provides an analysis of the trends in burn injury.

There was considerable heterogeneity between the studies, which limit the comparison of some finding reported by the studies. Although we conducted thorough search of literature on PubMed, EMBASE, and Google scholar and also complete our search by reviewing related and cross-referencing literature, existence of missing studies can never be excluded. The majority of data were obtained from the hospitals, limiting their generalization on a population level.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Burn injuries are a public health problem in Nepal, which is also one of the leading causes of injury-related morbidity and mortality. Although Nepal shares a big burden of burn injury, the studies concerning burn epidemiology and management are limited. To our best knowledge, this article is the first systemic review that provides an overview of epidemiological characteristic of burn injury from Nepal. We believe this article further helps clinicians and policymaker understand the epidemiological characteristics of burn injuries in Nepal and aids in implementing effective preventive strategies. Most cases of burn injuries are preventable, and we believe that if we can educate the people about burn injury and its preventive strategy, it will help reduce the burn morbidity and mortality to the great extent. Government and clinicians should focus on the preventive strategy rather than just treating the acute burn patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>This work did not receive any funding support.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>Not applicable.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>Both the authors (ST and SJB) have equally worked for this article which includes the literature search and analysis of the data.

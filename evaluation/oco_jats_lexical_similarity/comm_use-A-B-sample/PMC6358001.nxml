approach to accelerating vaccine development, for use in both non-endemic and
endemic populations: they can facilitate identification of the most promising
candidate vaccines for further trials and advance understanding of protective
immunity. Helminths present a continuing health burden in sub-Saharan Africa.
Vaccine development for these complex organisms is particularly challenging,
partly because protective responses are akin to mechanisms of allergy. A CHI
model for <italic>Schistosoma mansoni </italic>(CHI-S) has been developed at
Leiden University Medical Centre, the Netherlands. However, responses to
schistosome infections, and candidate vaccines, are likely to be different among
people from endemic settings compared to schistosome-na&#x000ef;ve Dutch
volunteers. Furthermore, among volunteers from endemic regions who have acquired
immune responses through prior exposure, schistosome challenge can be used to
define responses associated with clinical protection, and thus to guide vaccine
development.&#x000a0; To explore the possibility of establishing the CHI-S in
Uganda, a Stakeholders&#x02019; Meeting was held in Entebbe in 2017. Regulators,
community members, researchers and policy-makers discussed implementation
challenges and recommended preparatory steps: risk assessment; development of
infrastructure and technical capacity to produce the infectious challenge
material in Uganda; community engagement from Parliamentary to grass-roots
level; pilot studies to establish approaches to assuring fully informed consent
and true voluntariness, and strategies for selection of volunteers who can avoid
natural infection during the 12-week CHI-S; the building of regulatory capacity;
and the development of study protocols and a product dossier in close
consultation with ethical and regulatory partners. It was recommended that, on
completion, the protocol and product dossier be reviewed for approval in a joint
meeting combining ethical, regulatory and environment management authorities.
Most importantly, representatives of schistosomiasis-affected communities
emphasised the urgent need for an effective vaccine and urged the research
community not to delay in the development process.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>Controlled human infection model; Schistosoma mansoni; Uganda; The

infectious diseases, but are still lacking for major poverty-related and neglected
infections, including helminth infections. The conventional approach to vaccine
development, testing efficacy in human subjects in large Phase III trials after
safety and immunogenicity are confirmed through smaller Phase I and II trials, is
lengthy and extremely costly. An alternative approach, to identify the most
promising candidate vaccines through controlled human infection (CHI) models
(typically referred to as Phase IIa), is gaining acceptance and application for
infections including malaria, typhoid and others: to date about 22,000 volunteers
have been infected, safely, with 23 different pathogens<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>.</p><p id="P5">Schistosomiasis is a major parasitic infectious disease, considered second
only to malaria as a parasitic cause of morbidity and mortality<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. The current approach to control schistosomiasis is
through mass drug administration (MDA) with praziquantel, but this is limited by
high rates of re-infection and there are concerns about the possible emergence of
drug resistance<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. An effective vaccine would be an extremely valuable
control tool but vaccine development for this complex organism is challenging. In a
bid to accelerate this, Meta Roestenberg and colleagues at the Leiden University
Medical Centre have developed a controlled human infection model for
<italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> (CHI-S) and tested it among Dutch
volunteers. However, the response to <italic>Schistosoma</italic> infection, and to
candidate vaccines, is likely to differ markedly among people from endemic African
populations (where vaccines are most needed and where people are exposed to an
abundance of potentially immunomodulating infections) compared to European
volunteers. Furthermore, individuals from endemic populations may display some
resistance to CHI-S due to prior schistosome exposure. Vaccine development against
several pathogens has been informed by studies in which naturally acquired immune
responses are correlated with clinical protection, in order to inform vaccine
developers on ideal antigens, epitopes and protective thresholds. Thus challenge
studies among volunteers from endemic settings, who have naturally acquired
immunity, have the potential also to accelerate the development of the next
generation of vaccines by allowing desirable immune responses to be identified and
prioritised. Implementation of the CHI-S model <italic/> in an endemic setting would
therefore provide critical additional information on markers of protective immunity
and on immunogenicity, safety and efficacy of candidate vaccines. </p><p id="P6">As a first step towards establishing the CHI-S in an endemic setting, we held
a stakeholders meeting in Entebbe, Uganda, in November 2017, to identify key
challenges and to develop strategies to address them. Meeting participants included
representatives of Uganda&#x02019;s Ministry of Health (Vector Control Division),
National Council for Science and Technology, National Drug Authority and National
Environment Management Authority; researchers and clinicians who manage
schistosomiasis and its complications; chairpersons, committee members and community
representatives from various Ugandan ethics fora across the country (the Uganda
Virus Research Institute, Makerere University and Mbarara University);
representatives of potential volunteer communities (Makerere University students and
community representatives from Koome Islands in Lake Victoria); colleagues with
experience of implementing controlled human malaria infections (CHMI) from Kenya and
with ethics expertise from Kenya and Malawi; and the team who developed the CHI-S
from Leiden. Deliberations were informed by the earlier work on CHMI in Kenya, and
by the proceedings of the meeting on CHI models held in Malawi in June 2017<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. We here report proceedings of the Uganda
meeting.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Schistosomiasis</title><p id="P7">Schistosomiasis is estimated to affect 230 million people worldwide, the
majority of them in sub-Saharan Africa<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. In
Uganda, schistosomiasis was first described in the 1900s and was recognised as a
serious public health problem in the 1950s<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>.
Mapping, and the development of a control plan in the 1990s, provided a strong basis
for the work of the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative, which launched its programme
of control by Mass Drug Administration using praziquantel in Uganda in 2003. Initial
results from MDA were promising<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> but recent
data show that, despite enhanced coverage, both prevalence and intensity of
infection remain high in &#x0201c;hot spot&#x0201d; lakeshore communities. It is
increasingly evident that MDA alone will not be adequate to achieve WHO&#x02019;s
target of elimination of schistosomiasis as a public health problem by 2030. Of
Uganda&#x02019;s population of 36 million, more than 4 million are estimated to be
infected with schistosomiasis, and 55% of the present population is estimated to be
at risk<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. </p><p id="P8">Adult <italic>Schistosoma</italic> worms reside in blood vessels around the
gut (<italic>S. mansoni</italic>, <italic>S. intercalatum</italic> and <italic>S.
japonicum</italic>) or urinary bladder (<italic>S. haematobium</italic>), where
the female lays eggs which are excreted through the intestinal or bladder wall and
voided in stool or urine. In water, each egg hatches producing a single miracidium.
This enters the intermediate snail host where it multiplies asexually, producing
identical cercariae. Cercariae are shed into the water where they again infect the
human host by penetrating through the skin (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure
1</xref>)<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. </p><p id="P9">Humans sometimes experience cercarial dermatitis in response to the
penetrating parasites and a minority develop acute schistosomiasis syndrome
(&#x0201c;Katayama Fever&#x0201d;) in reaction to an initial infection. However, most
serious disease caused by schistosome infection is due to the eggs. Besides being
excreted in stool or urine, many eggs also find their way into other tissues,
notably the liver: progressive liver fibrosis results in portal hypertension,
splenomegaly, and ascites; oesophageal varices develop which can lead to death
through uncontrolled haemorrhage<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. Effective
management, for example by repeated, endoscopic band ligation of the varices<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, is seldom available in the resource-limited
settings where schistosomiasis is common: upper gastrointestinal bleeding, resulting
from <italic>S. mansoni</italic>-induced periportal fibrosis is a common complaint
in primary health care in Northern Uganda, along the course of the Nile<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>.
Hepatosplenic schistosomiasis is also associated with stunted growth and anaemia,
leucopenia and thrombocytopenia. Occasionally eggs can be found in the spinal cord
or brain, causing neuropathology<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. </p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Vaccines for schistosomiasis</title><p id="P10">A vaccine for schistosomiasis has been ranked among the top 10 vaccines that
need to be developed urgently<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. Schistosomes
are large, multicellular animals that have evolved to co-exist with their human
host. The immunoregulatory properties of schistosomes, which enable them to live in
the portal vasculature without immune clearance, are likely to impede vaccine
development<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. The complex interplay
between T-helper (Th)1, Th2 and regulatory responses is still incompletely
understood. Schistosome killing is mediated by antibody responses, and particularly
by Immunoglobulin (Ig)E<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, presenting the
risk that an effective IgE-inducing vaccine might induce allergic reactions,
especially among previously-exposed individuals from endemic populations (as in the
case of a candidate hookworm vaccine<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).
T-helper (Th)2 response profiles are therefore undesirable. Th1 responses must be
targeted. In animal models a Th1 response has been shown to be able to participate
in immunity against schistosomes<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, but it is
not yet certain which Th1 responses can induce protective immunity and correlates of
protection have not been identified. An ideal anti-schistosome vaccine would be
suitable for use among young children in endemic settings, as well as adults in
high-risk occupations; it would achieve 75% reduction in infection intensity
(assessed by circulating antigen or egg production); it would require administration
of, at most, two doses; it would induce protection lasting at least five to 10
years<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>; it would not induce IgE; and it
would be suitable to co-administer with MDA.</p><p id="P11">Attenuated whole organisms from some helminth species, including schistosome
cercariae, have been shown to induce protective immunity in animals<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, but
production of attenuated cercariae for large-scale administration is not feasible,
thus the current goal is to identify helminth antigens that induce protective
responses, but not IgE. Approaches to this include the use of sera generated in
animal studies using attenuated larvae, or from human population studies that
determine resistance to re-infection after MDA, together with recombinant antigens
developed from the investigation of the parasite transcriptome and proteome, to
identify antigen- and stage-specific antibodies associated with protection<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>.
To date, four antigens (SmTSP-2, Sm14, Smp80 and Sh28GST) have been identified and
tested, and show promise of efficacy in animal models; three (SmTSP-2, Sm14, Smp80)
are ready to enter Phase I trials and one (Sh28GST, Bilhvax) has undergone a Phase
III trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00870649">NCT00870649</ext-link>: this has been completed but no data have yet been
released on the outcome of the trial). However, transcriptomic-proteomic approaches
suggest many more candidates that could be evaluated as vaccine antigens, either
singly or in combinations<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. Unfortunately, the limited resources
available for schistosome vaccine development restrict the number of candidates that
can be taken forward. As yet, the value of animal models for predicting efficacy of,
and responses to, schistosome vaccine candidates in humans is unknown. Murine models
may not be the optimal platform; baboons are considered the most suitable, and have
been used to further the SmTSP-2 vaccine candidate to phase I testing in humans, but
they are expensive and reagents for immunological studies are limited. In general,
animal models have been of great utility in asking fundamental questions regarding
immunology and demonstrating proof-of-principle of particular vaccination
strategies, but do not recapitulate precisely the physiology of human infections,
and therefore cannot be considered a substitute for human studies. Clinical testing
of novel candidates in humans is needed to obtain true efficacy data.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The controlled human schistosome infection model</title><p id="P12">The CHI-S model addresses many of the roadblocks to development of an
effective vaccine for schistosomiasis (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table
1</xref>). The model alone will provide novel information on the evolution of
immune responses following infection. Combined with a model &#x0201c;vaccine&#x0201d;,
such as irradiated cercariae, it has the potential to identify correlates of
protection, particularly protective Th1 responses that could be harnessed for
vaccine development. Then, used as a challenge in phase I vaccine trials, CHI-S will
allow efficient and timely selection of potential vaccine candidates, and hence
could improve and accelerate the vaccine development pipeline. Implemented in the
endemic setting, CHI-S will take into account the impact of prior and current
exposure to schistosome infection (including pre-natal exposure)<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and allow modelling of efficacy in target populations,
and in association with praziquantel MDA. In addition, CHI-S offers potential for
testing the efficacy of new drugs for treatment of schistosomiasis. </p><p id="P13">The Leiden CHI-S has been developed with detailed attention to safety in
both production and administration of the infectious challenge product. Because eggs
are the main source of morbidity and pathology, the CHI-S avoids permanent pathology
by making use of single-sex infections. Using the laboratory lifecycle, individual
snails are isolated and each snail is carefully infected with a single miracidium.
This undergoes asexual reproduction in the snail and after five weeks produces
thousands of cercariae of a single clone, and hence single sex. Following several
quality control steps and determination of male or female sex by PCR, male cercariae
are used for the controlled infection of volunteers. This is done by taping a
chamber of water containing a predetermined number of male cercariae onto the
volunteer&#x02019;s forearm for a 30-minute interval. Work towards an infection model
using female cercariae is in progress, but male worms do better than females when
not in pairs and the possibility of production of sterile eggs from females needs to
be excluded. Successful infections can be detected (usually after six to 12 weeks)
and quantified by measuring circulating anodic antigen (CAA) levels in the blood:
this is a protein which is secreted into the blood in large quantities by adult
worms<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. Volunteers are followed up for
12 weeks and then treated with praziquantel. The infected snails and preparation of
cercariae are managed in customised, dedicated facilities following Good
Manufacturing Practice guidelines. The volunteers are intentionally infected with
the male cercariae, and followed up until after they are cured, under conditions
analogous to a Phase I Clinical Trial.</p><p id="P14">Technical considerations for implementation of the CHI-S in Uganda
principally comprise the preparation of cercariae for the inoculum. Because the
shelf-life of cercariae is just two hours, cercarial production for human challenge
must be done locally. In Leiden, the <italic>S. mansoni</italic> life cycle is
maintained in hamsters using a laboratory strain of <italic>S. mansoni</italic>
which originated in Puerto Rico and <italic>Biomphalaria glabrata</italic> snails;
this snail species is not endemic in Uganda. In Uganda, the laboratory life cycle
has previously been maintained by the Vector Control Division of the Ministry of
Health for another project, using mice and a range of endemic
<italic>Biomphalaria</italic> species (including <italic>B.
choanomphala</italic>, <italic>B. stanleyi</italic>, and <italic>B.
sudanica</italic>)<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, but it is not
actively maintained at present. </p><p id="P15">Options for preparing the inoculum in Uganda include (1) re-establishing the
full <italic>S. mansoni</italic> laboratory life-cycle; (2) shipping cryopreserved
miracidia or eggs from Leiden for snail infection and cercarial shedding in Entebbe
(technologies for cryopreservation of miracidia or eggs still need to be developed);
(3) shipping infected snails from Leiden for shedding in Entebbe.</p><p id="P16">The third option, of shipping infected snails, is currently the most
feasible. Guidelines for shipping live snails (including infected snails), developed
by the Danish Bilharzia Laboratory, are available. These will need to be combined
with International Air Transport Association (IATA) requirements for shipping of
infectious material. It will be important to work with customs officials and
handling agents to ensure efficient release on arrival in Uganda. This process will
need to be piloted. A risk assessment will need to be undertaken, in collaboration
with the Uganda National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) regarding potential
introduction of a new snail species and <italic>S. mansoni</italic> strain into
Ugandan water bodies and risk management protocols will need to be implemented to
ensure that this does not occur. Facilities for housing and shedding the snails, and
preparing the inoculum in accordance with GMP guidelines, will need to be
established. </p><p id="P17">Post-meeting, a fourth option for a truly-local Ugandan CHI-S was proposed.
This would involve generating the inoculum by obtaining miracidia from stool samples
of infected people in Uganda, and using these to infect snails of a local species in
the laboratory. This would have advantages. The use of a non-endemic
<italic>Schistosoma</italic> strain and of non-endemic snail species would be
avoided. The model would be closer to real life in Uganda. Additional capacity would
be built in-country. However, this approach would also bring additional challenges.
The full life-cycle (option (1) above) would need to be established in order to test
the Ugandan schistosome strain obtained for praziquantel susceptibility before use
in controlled human infections. And it would be more difficult to interpret any
differences in responses to vaccines or to infection between studies in Uganda and
studies in Leiden (or elsewhere). Nevertheless, this remains an important option for
further discussion.</p><p id="P18">Good clinical laboratory practice (GCLP) accredited facilities and expertise
for PCR (to confirm male sex of cercariae) are already available in Uganda, and
plans are in place to provide equipment for high-sensitivity detection of infection
by measurement of serum CAA in 2018. Immunological expertise for the conduct of
antibody ELISAs and cellular immune response assays is also available. However,
training of the Ugandan team to undertake specific procedures, and to replicate
quality control procedures that have been developed in Leiden, will be key. </p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Protocol development and participant recruitment considerations for CHI-S in
Uganda</title><p id="P19">Ugandan researchers have substantial experience of community engagement and
of conducting Phase I trials under Good Clinical Practice (GCP) conditions. However,
the stakeholders&#x02019; meeting recognised that enhanced attention to aspects of
these activities would be required for the CHI-S. </p><p id="P20">Full details of community engagement plans will be needed as part of the
CHI-S protocol. There is need to involve opinion leaders, including members of
Parliament such as the Parliamentary Committee on Health, and Resident District
Commissioners and District Health Officers of the participating districts, as well
as local council leaders, in order to prevent circulation of misinformation about
the work. Populations of interest for CHI-S will include Ugandans not previously
exposed to schistosomiasis (perhaps from an urban setting) as well as those from
schistosomiasis-endemic communities (prior exposure for inclusion or exclusion can
be determined by measuring IgG antibody to schistosome egg antigen): experience in
Kenya with the controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) model showed that
participants coming from areas with no active transmission (Nairobi residents) had
low baseline responses to malaria, and a challenge response similar to
Europeans<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, whereas those resident where
active malaria transmission occurs had higher baseline responses - indicative of
either recent or prior malaria exposure - and a distinct profile of response to
challenge (Kapulu, Bejon personal communication).</p><p id="P21">Kenyan researchers involved university communities for their first CHMI
studies<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, but a few attendees of the
Uganda meeting expressed concern about specifically targeting students. Although
adults, university students are often still dependents and parents might have
objections. It was agreed that volunteers would be expected to inform their next of
kin about their participation and that contact details for the next of kin must be
provided in case of emergency. Critical to recruitment, and to obtaining informed
consent, would be the inclusion of a test that clearly demonstrates a full
understanding of the CHI-S model, and reassurance that participation is truly
voluntary. Based on Leiden experience, the time taken by the team to know the
potential volunteers, during the initial screening and recruitment procedures, is
expected to be valuable in selecting those that will understand, and reliably comply
with, the procedures.</p><p id="P22">Volunteers from endemic communities are likely to be actively infected with
<italic>S. mansoni</italic> at the time of recruitment. Such infections will
need to be treated with praziquantel before enrolment in the CHI-S. This may require
more than one dose of treatment; cure can be determined using the highly-sensitive
CAA assay. For individuals from endemic communities, there is also a substantial
risk of re-exposure during the 12-week follow-up period between the CHI-S infection
and cure; natural infection may be added to the CHI-S infection. While the resulting
risk to the volunteer would be comparable to their usual lifestyle, this would
invalidate the results of the study. Therefore, volunteers will need to be carefully
selected to ensure that they are able and willing to avoid re-exposure. The 12-week
duration of the CHI-S follow up means that admission to a facility (as practiced in
some CHMI studies) would not be feasible. Follow up of a randomised, placebo group
could be considered in order to assess whether there are substantial re-infection
rates in a study group. </p><p id="P23">The Uganda CHI-S protocol will be expected to meet all the requirements of a
phase I trial. A data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will be needed, as well as
internal and external monitoring. A realistic evaluation of risks to the volunteers
must be included: the intensity of the risk is expected to be lower than for malaria
(for example), such that hospital admission will not be necessary, but a 24-hour
helpline will be needed. Treatability and methods of treatment of likely side
effects and safety evaluations to be conducted must be mentioned. Insurance
provision will be necessary: post-meeting information indicated that this should be
provided by a local company or agent, but it was recognised that local insurance
companies in Uganda are unfamiliar with clinical trials and education of these
bodies is needed. Material transfer agreements will be required for protocols
involving import of snails or miracidia, and for export of samples if assays are to
be done outside Uganda; data sharing agreements, where necessary, would need to be
developed and implemented.</p><p id="P24">Rates for compensation of lost time or income, and transport costs, to
volunteers will need to be specified and it will be challenging to set amounts that
recognise demands upon the volunteers but do not constitute an undue inducement,
since almost any payment may be an inducement in Ugandan settings. Principles for
setting the payments will include estimates of time and income loss from visits and
reimbursement for transport costs and other inconveniences. Time compensation should
be adjusted to the average income or wages in a particular community (for example
the Kenyan CHMI studies offered higher rates of compensation in Nairobi than in
Kilifi, based on the premise that Nairobi was an urban setting with higher income
than in the coastal town of Kilifi which is in a rural setting). It is generally
considered that participants should not be compensated for risk, since this could be
interpreted as an undue inducement to take risks.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Ethical and regulatory considerations for CHI-S in Uganda</title><p id="P25">The fundamental ethical issue of concern in relation to CHI models is the
principle of non-maleficence, to do no harm: CHI models represent a new ethical
challenge and dilemma &#x02013; using harm with a view to achieving benefit.
Historical atrocities involving deliberate infection of vulnerable populations have
an important influence on thinking in this field. Guidelines governing the
implementation of CHI models are not available in African countries. While
guidelines would be desirable, these take a long time to be developed and approved.
At the stakeholders&#x02019; meeting, it was recommended that the principles
articulated by the World Health Organisation (2016)<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> and benchmarks developed at the Malawi meeting on Controlled Human
Infection Models in Low Income Countries<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> be
employed to govern the ethical and regulatory approval process. These are set out in
<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, which also identifies ways in
which the Uganda CHI-S will address them. Among the benchmarks outlined, critical
elements discussed included the following. First, ethical and regulatory standards
governing CHI studies in Africa must be equivalent to, or above, the minimum human
protection standards applied internationally, as well as locally. When necessary,
the capacity of ethical and regulatory bodies must be built, as well as the capacity
of researchers. Second, risks must be examined and evaluated before considering
possible benefits; there must be a favourable benefit: risk ratio. Arguably the risk
associated with a controlled human infection may be more justifiable in an endemic
population than in an unaffected population. Third, all stakeholders must be fully
informed; in particular, as discussed above, volunteers must fully understand the
study, its risks, and benefits, and must be shown to do so. Contributions of social
science research to identifying ways of achieving this were desirable. </p><p id="P26">In terms of the regulatory landscape, key stakeholders in Uganda include the
Uganda National Council for Science and Technology (UNCST), the National Drug
Authority (NDA) and National Environment Management Agency (NEMA) as well as
Institutional Review Boards. The roles of these authorities were discussed and it
was concluded that the UNCST would hold overall authority for approval of
importation of snails (infected or otherwise) and for review and approval of a CHI-S
protocol. A joint review meeting, with all regulatory authorities represented, was
recommended, as well as engagement between the researchers and ethical and
regulatory review bodies throughout the process of protocol development and
implementation. </p><p id="P27">The nature of the human challenge product, the inoculum of infectious
cercariae, was noted to present a particular dilemma. Whereas the product for
malaria is a licensed, FDA-approved cryopreserved product<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, the CHI-S product must be generated locally for each
infection. This requires local laboratory capacity for high-quality production
on-site, and local regulatory capacity for approval of the facilities and processes.
Under these circumstances, provision of documentation corresponding to the standard
requirements of investigator&#x02019;s brochure, certificate of good manufacturing
practice, sample label, certificate of analysis and letter of authorisation from the
product &#x0201c;owner&#x0201d; may be difficult, but a product dossier containing
equivalent information will be needed. This would be considered alongside full
documentation of procedures and results from Leiden by the regulatory bodies. </p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Contribution from representatives of endemic communities</title><p id="P28">Among representatives from endemic communities, Mr. Asuman Muwumuza,
Councillor for Koome sub-county which comprises island communities in Lake Victoria,
expressed strong support for the development of the CHI-S in Uganda. He assured the
Meeting that local communities would understand the purpose of the study and want to
participate, would gladly volunteer and would do whatever would be needed to
facilitate these complicated trials. He felt that the need for a vaccine for
schistosomiasis was urgent and urged the research community not to delay.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Conclusion and next steps</title><p id="P29">Researchers, community members and regulators participating in the
stakeholders&#x02019; meeting expressed substantial support for establishing CHI-S in
Uganda; this was considered both feasible and desirable. </p><p id="P30">Key next steps (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) include risk
assessments for importation of infected snails, the development of facilities and
expertise for production of the challenge product; community engagement and pilot
studies to assess information and consent tools and comprehension by target
communities, and to define appropriate populations (able to avoid re-infection, and
to participate with full understanding and as true volunteers); provision of
opportunities for regulators and ethicists to learn more about CHI-S through visits
to Leiden and engagement with their Dutch counterparts; and development of a draft
CHI-S protocol, product dossier and accompanying documentation for regulatory
review.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="S9"><title>Data availability</title><p id="P31">No data is associated with this article</p></sec></body><back><ack id="SA1"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p id="P33">We thank especially Raymond Muganyizi, Moses Kizza, Keren Apio, Edward

summary following a stakeholders' meeting in Entebbe, Uganda, where key individuals
discussed relevant issues in establishing a controlled human infection model for
<italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> in Uganda. The report also reviews the
disease burden, biology, and epidemiology of schistosomiasis. A brief update on
current vaccines for schistosomiasis is also included. The authors condense outcomes
of the meeting into tabular format and relevant next-steps to advance controlled
human infection models for schistosomiasis in Uganda.</p><p id="P42"> Comments: <list list-type="order" id="L1"><list-item><p id="P43">The introduction highlights development of the <italic>S.
mansoni </italic>CHI model, but does not completely describe if this
model could potentially inform development of a vaccine against
<italic>S. mansoni </italic>alone, a model upon which <italic>S.
hematobium </italic>and other species could be built, or if a
species-transcending vaccine is feasible given the current state of
scientific knowledge as proposed by M Merrifield in <italic>Vaccine

could be augmented if details on age-specific carriage rates in
communities is available, and/or data regarding special populations
hardest-hit by schistosomiasis (immunocompromised, children, etc) can be
provided. This would orient the reader toward where vaccine efforts are
most warranted.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P45">The background section on schistosomiasis does not completely
discuss <italic>S. hematobium </italic>complications, presumably because
the focus of the article is on <italic>S. mansoni</italic>. Consider
that a successful model for <italic>S. mansoni </italic>could pave the
way for a successful CHI model for <italic>S. hematobium</italic>.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P46">The section on vaccines for schistosomiasis notes that an ideal
vaccine would be suitable for use among young children. A very brief
explanation as to why this population is targeted would be informative
for readers.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P47">Additional considerations for Table 1 is that schistosomiasis
epidemiology is dynamic and may be difficult to predict, such that large
field studies testing candidate vaccines may not show effect if
significant changes in local epidemiology occur. Also, to study
infection prevention as a vaccine trial endpoint in a population,
individuals would require pre-treatment before vaccination, and this
pre-treatment may decrease community transmission significantly such
that vaccine efficacy would be difficult to measure. CHI also allows
efficient testing of vaccine efficacy in individuals with a known
exposure profile and background immunity to schistosomiasis.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P48">The section on endpoints in CHI studies- is parallel testing
with Leiden and Uganda planned for the PCR protein detection, or is
another backup method to confirm the presence of <italic>S. mansoni
</italic>in place? This would be advantageous to address from a quality
management perspective.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P49">In addition to community engagement plans, careful risk
management strategies for CHI in low and middle-income countries are an
important consideration as information management and mitigation needs
to be planned and ready to activate to mitigate undesired publicity of
CHI on social media and other avenues of communication.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P50">Are there technical or infrastructure aspects of the research
milieu in Uganda that made it suitable as the first African host country
for CHI for schistosomiasis? If yes, consider noting these in case other
groups are considering pilot CHI studies in low and middle-income
countries.</p></list-item></list>

<bold>Major issues:</bold>
<list list-type="bullet" id="L2"><list-item><p id="P55">While the&#x000a0;paper provides an excellent overview of
schistosomiasis and the CHI-S model, the transition from background on
schistosomiasis to the report on the meeting&#x000a0;could benefit from a
brief foreshadowing of the major findings from the stakeholders
meeting.&#x000a0; While the technical hurdles to implementation of the
CHI-S model in Uganda were more easily identified and labeled (and are
present in Table 3), it seems more difficult to identify discrete core
ethical and community based hurdles.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;The authors could
consider adding more bullet points to Table 3 to expand on some of these
ethical and community based hurdles.&#x000a0; The authors could also add a
few overview-type sentences when the paper transitions from
Background/Summary to Stakeholder meeting report.</p></list-item></list>

&#x0201c;Populations of interest for CHI-S will include Ugandans not
previously exposed to schistosomiasis (perhaps from an urban setting) as
well as those from schistosomiasis-endemic communities (prior exposure
for inclusion or exclusion can be determined by measuring IgG antibody
to schistosome egg antigen): experience in Kenya with the controlled
human malaria infection (CHMI) model showed that participants coming
from areas with no active transmission (Nairobi residents) had low
baseline responses to malaria, and a challenge response similar to
Europeans3, whereas those resident where active malaria transmission
occurs had higher baseline responses - indicative of either recent or
prior malaria exposure - and a distinct profile of response to challenge
(Kapulu, Bejon personal communication)."</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P60">Note that Sanaria's PfSPZ product is NOT yet "FDA
approved".&#x000a0; This misunderstanding should be corrected toward the
end of the section titled &#x0201c;Ethical and regulatory considerations
for CHI-S in Uganda&#x0201d;.&#x000a0; The Sanaria product is being
investigated under an FDA Investigational New Drug application.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P61">The section &#x0201c;Contribution from representatives of endemic
communities&#x0201d; lists contributions from a single individual who is
said to speak for some of these communities.&#x000a0; However, the section
title sounds more generalized than the text indicates.&#x000a0; I would
suggest folding this section into another section as the current
representation seems to potentially overly generalize the responses from
one (albeit generous and collaborative) individual.</p></list-item></list>

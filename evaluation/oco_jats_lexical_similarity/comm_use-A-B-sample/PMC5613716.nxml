threatens the survival of hospital organizations, especially philanthropic ones,
that play an essential role in serving the poorest class of the population.</p><p>These philanthropic institutions benefit from tax immunity, but must allocate 60% of
their capacity to the Unified Public Health System (SUS) or 20% of their total
services as free services to the population<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. In
this way, they face serious financial problems that may compromise their
survival<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>
and impact on meeting the population's demand, considering the various health care
procedures that are performed by SUS throughout Brazil. Therefore, cost management
has been pointed out as an essential tool for controlling and evaluating these
organizations, both public and private<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Among the several cardiac surgeries performed by SUS in Brazil, the most frequent is
coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), performed in both public and private hospitals
throughout the country<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. However, few Brazilian studies have analyzed the cost
of this complex procedure and the specific transfer of funds from SUS regarding this
surgery.</p><p>Cost is defined as an expense relating to a good or service used in the production of
other goods or services, and may be classified into direct, indirect, fixed or
variable cost, and the sum of all these cost forms is defined as total
cost<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. The
most widely used costing system by hospitals to gauge total costs is known as the
Absorption Costing System. The main characteristics of this costing system are the
need for apportionment in the case of appropriation of indirect costs, and that the
results are directly influenced by the production volume<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>On the other hand, the transfer of funds from SUS consists of the amount of money
paid by the Ministry of Health (MOH) to health institutions for their performed
procedures, pursuant to Administrative Rule no. 204 of January 29, 2007, which
regulates the financing and transfer of federal resources to health actions and
services, with appropriate monitoring and control<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>SUS spent more than R$209 million to perform isolated CABGs and/or those associated
with other procedures in the city of S&#x000e3;o Paulo from 2011 to 2014, which
corresponded to an average expenditure of R$12,025.66 per patient<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. These expenses are derived
from amounts transferred from SUS measuring or from contracts that some hospitals
establish with the system, and not by measuring the costs of surgeries.</p><p>Thus, it is unknown how this total cost is conferred in the different hospitals in
Brazil and if the fund transfer from SUS can cover them.</p><p>Therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify the coverage percentage of
hospitalization costs for CABG by fund transfer from SUS in a philanthropic hospital
in the city of S&#x000e3;o Paulo that implements the consolidated Absorption Costing
System.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>A quantitative, descriptive and cross-sectional study carried out in the
Benefic&#x000ea;ncia Portuguesa Hospital of S&#x000e3;o Paulo, which is a
philanthropic, special-purpose hospital in the city of S&#x000e3;o Paulo. This
hospital has a database started in 2009, which collects information on their
performed myocardial revascularization surgeries such as demography, diagnostic
exams, surgical techniques, complications, mortality, drug treatment, length of
hospital stay, and costs, among others, and is part of the continuous improvement of
the institution's care practices.</p><p>The information for this study was extracted from a database composed of 1913
patients submitted to CABG at the surveyed institution, aged 18 years or older in
the period from March 13 to September 30, 2012, and includes data from 100% of all
CABG performed at the hospital in this period.</p><p>The choice for this period was due to this being the beginning of information
inclusion on cost and fund transfer from SUS available for study. The database has
1913 patients. Isolated surgeries (without other associated procedures), elective
surgeries (which were not urgent or an emergency), surgeries using extracorporeal
circulation (EC) and those that had SUS funding as a source for hospitalization
costs were included in the study. Five hundred and fifty-one (551-28.8%) patients
were excluded, totaling 1362 for the study sample. However, the sum of exclusion was
not 551, since some patients were excluded due to more than one reason for not
participating in the study, according to the exclusion criteria [172 (9%)
non-SUS; 13 (0.7%) for not having cost information; 76 (4.0%) deaths, 206 (10.8%)
non-isolated CABG; 17 (0.9%) urgencies; 1 (0.05%) emergency; 132 (6.9%) without EC
and 8 (0.4%) patients who remained in the ICU at the time of the database closing on
the 30<sup>th</sup> postoperative day]. Deaths and inpatients were excluded
since the evaluated cost refers to hospital admission, and groups were compared
according to length of hospital stay.</p><p>The research was conducted in accordance with Resolution of the National Health
Council, number 466 of December 12, 2012, and authorized by the Research Ethics
Committees of the Nursing School of the University of S&#x000e3;o Paulo, with Opinion
No: 1.024.151 on 4/15/15, and of the institution under study with Opinion No:
1.088,381 on 06/01/15. Patient identification data were not made available. Clear
and informed consent forms were not solicited from patients since this is a
retrospective and documentary study.</p><sec><title>Surveying Costs and Measuring Revenues</title><p>We analyzed the cost variables available in the database such as the total cost
of hospital admissions, revenue transfers by SUS and the difference between
revenue and cost. The Brazilian real (R$) was converted to US dollar ($). We
used the quotation value of the dollar (purchase) on 09/28/2012, which was
2.0265 reais<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.
We considered the dollar value close to the finishing date of data collection
(09/30/2012), since there was no access to the cost per patient at the time of
hospital discharge.</p><p>The Absorption Costing System was implemented in 2010 into the hospital under
study from the perspective of managerial accounting with the formation of cost
centers. Thus, it was possible to gauge total costs by summing the direct,
indirect, fixed and variable costs of the services, procedures and examinations,
transposing the values into daily hospital charges and fees.</p><p>The fund transfer process from SUS is done according to inpatient hospital
authorizations (IHA)<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> generated for the patient. The Benefic&#x000ea;ncia
Portuguesa Hospital uses a consolidated controlling service from SUS, which
sends the debits from specific sites to MOH, which are analyzed, and the
corresponding values are then transferred to the hospital.</p></sec><sec><title>Data Analysis</title><p>All variables were initially analyzed descriptively. Minimum and maximum values
were analyzed for variable cost, revenue and time intervals, and averages,
standard deviations and medians were then calculated. Absolute and relative
frequencies were calculated for the group variables of hospitalization duration
and patients' profile characterization. Non-parametric Mann-Whitney test was
used for comparison of length of hospitalization groups in relation to cost and
income variables<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. Chi-square test<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> or Fisher's exact
test<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>
(for expected frequencies lower than 5) were used in order to test homogeneity
among the proportions of hospitalization groups. The level of significance used
for the tests was 5%.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The results are presented in three parts. The first part presents a panoramic view of
data on costs, revenues and funds transferred from SUS for CABG hospitalization
(<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). The second part shows the
average coverage percentage of funds transferred for the average total cost of
hospitalization per patient (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>) and
seeks to compare the average coverage percentage among groups according to the
length of hospital stay (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3</xref>). The third

total cost on hospital admission for the sample of 1362 patients was
$10,885,855.91, and consolidated revenue was $4,699,897.85, with the total funds
transferred from SUS being 43.17% of the costs, and total negative revenue of
56.83%.</p><p>The total average cost of hospitalization per patient as described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> was $7,992.55, and according to
information provided by the Hospital Cost Management under study, the direct
cost of hospitalization for CABGs in 2012 was 58% of the total cost, $4,635.68,
and the indirect cost was 42%, $3,356.87.</p><p>According to <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, the average revenue
transferred by SUS was $3,450.73, presenting an average coverage percentage of
48.66% of the total cost, thus generating average negative revenue of 51.34% to
the hospital, of which the largest portion is destined to the payment of medical
fees.</p><p>A difference was found in relation to the average revenue deficit and the average
of SUS transfers shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, since
the average revenue deficit and all calculations of cost, revenue and the
percentage difference between cost and revenue were statistically and
individually calculated for each of the 1362 patients in the sample. The values
were rounded for each patient with a difference or error occurring when
comparing the direct total average calculation as calculated by SUS transfers in
the last column of the table. This calculation of the transfer percentage was
based on the percentage difference of the revenue deficit.</p><p>According to <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>, the total cost
ranged from $3,300.26 to $152,132.10. Of these, 22 (1.62%) cases had a total
cost between $49,346.16 and $98,692.33, four (0.29%) cases between $98,692.33
and $148,038.49 and one (0.07%) case above $148,038.49.</p><p>Data from <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> also show intensive care
unit (ICU) readmission occurred in 156 (11.5%) patients. Comparing the total
cost and the funds transferred from SUS among readmitted and non-readmitted
patients (1206), it was verified that although those readmitted had higher costs
and higher revenues, the difference between cost and revenue was higher, thus
generating a higher percentage of negative revenue in relation to the group
without readmission (58.49% <italic>vs.</italic> 50.41%,
<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). Therefore, the average coverage percentage of
transferred funds was 41.51% for readmitted patients and 49.59% for
non-readmitted patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Mean Percentage of Hospital Admission Coverage in CABGs and Length of Stay
(LOS)</title><p>Average LOS was 11.23 days (2.73 preoperative, 8.50 postoperative, of which 2.42
were in ICU). At the institution under study, the medical practice manual
defines that LOS in isolated and elective CABGs should be up to seven days.</p><p>Thus, for a better cost evaluation and fund transfer from SUS, patients were
divided into Group 1 (LOS&#x02264;7 days) and Group 2 (LOS&#x0003e;7 days), and in
comparing the groups, it was possible to verify that 69.5% of the sample
presented LOS&#x0003e;7 days.</p><p>It can be observed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3</xref> that Group 2
presents significantly higher cost, revenue, difference between cost-revenue and
percentage difference (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001).</p><p>According to <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, Group 2 presented a
coverage percentage from SUS lower than Group 1 with 44.52%

higher percentage of negative revenue in the group of patients who spent more
than seven days hospitalized.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison of Groups in Relation to Preoperative and Postoperative
Profile</title><p>Of the 1362 patients, the mean age was 61.4 years and 69.9% were males. In
attempt to justify the increase in the hospital stay and costs, the groups'
preoperative profiles were compared. According to <xref ref-type="table" rid="t4">Table 4</xref>, the expected mortality risk assessed by EuroSCORE
I<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>
did not differ, but in relation to the preoperative factors, Group 2 had a
higher age (<italic>P</italic>=0.018), a higher number of diabetics
(<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) and a higher number of patients with chronic
kidney disease (<italic>P</italic>=0.002).</p><p>Regarding the presence of postoperative complications, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t4">Table 4</xref> shows that Group 2 presented a higher need for blood
transfusion, atrial fibrillation requiring intervention, major bleeding,
pneumonia, acute renal failure, acute perioperative myocardial infarction,
hemodialysis, stroke, prolonged mechanical ventilation (up to 48 hours) and
reoperation due to bleeding and/or mediastinitis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Data from the present research showed that the total funds transferred from SUS only
covered 43.17% of the total consolidated cost and generated a revenue deficit of
56.83%. The funds transferred per patient were only 48.66%, lower than the direct
cost of hospitalization.</p><p>Although CABG is the most performed heart surgery by SUS in Brazil, few studies have
analyzed the costs of the procedure. This lack of literature may be due to the fact
that health institutions do not have a Consolidated Costing System.</p><p>In the few Brazilian studies on CABG costs, it can be noticed that some did not
assess procedure nor hospitalization costs. Some authors have considered the values
of fixed tables as costs based on Inpatient Hospital Authorization (IHA) or on
prices of pre-established packages<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. Others
cited the transferred funds from SUS as a direct cost and additional institutional
costs as indirect costs<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>, which may underestimate the real cost of the
procedure.</p><p>A study carried out in a public hospital in the city of S&#x000e3;o Paulo revealed
that coverage from SUS for the total average cost of the procedure in primary,
isolated and elective CABGs in 2005 was 79.41% of the direct costs of the
procedure<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>. However, the total cost of hospitalization was not
included, which could significantly reduce this percentage.</p><p>According to the Health Information Portal of the Municipality of S&#x000e3;o
Paulo/IHA, the consolidated funds transferred from SUS through the total amount of
IHA paid for CABG (isolated and associated with other procedures) from 2011 to 2014
was R$209,883,898.93; of which R$57,094,462.41 in 2011, R$55,322,437.14 in 2012,
R$48,746,376.00 in 2013 and R$48,720,623.38 in 2014. However, the average
transferred per patient from 2011 to 2014 was R$12,025.66, with R$11,862.55 in 2011,
R$12,052.82 in 2012, R$12,045.06 in 2013 and R$12,171.03 in 2014<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Comparing the consolidated funds transferred from SUS for CABGs of the present
research to the municipality of S&#x000e3;o Paulo in 2012<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>, it was verified that the
value transferred to the institution under study corresponded to 17.22% of the funds
transferred to the municipality. It is worth mentioning that the research
institution was responsible for 16.4 to 17.5% of the CABGs performed by SUS in the
period from 2008 to 2014<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>, a significant percentage
of this procedure in the country.</p><p>When comparing the mean of funds transferred from SUS for CABG per patient in 2012
between data from this research and data from the city of S&#x000e3;o
Paulo<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>, it
was verified that the funds transferred in the present research corresponded to
58.02% of the average per patient in the municipality. However, the study sample was
from isolated and elective CABGs. This shows that these transferred funds may have
increased according to the patient's severity, as demonstrated by authors in
2015<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Most Brazilian studies only address the direct cost of the procedure, with almost no
studies addressing the total cost or transferred funds from SUS for CABGs. In 2015,
a study was published on average total cost and transfers from SUS for cardiac
surgeries performed in 2013, with 48.8% of the evaluated surgeries being
CABGs<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>.
This study showed that transfers increased according to the severity of the
EuroSCORE<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>, while the funds transferred for low-risk patients was
R$14,306.00, for medium-risk R$16,217.00, and R$19,548.00 for high-risk patients
(<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001)<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>, corresponding to coverages of 52.75%, 46.53% and
45.21%, respectively. The authors demonstrated that the transferred funds were not
proportional to the total cost, presenting a lower coverage percentage as the
severity, cost and LOS increased.</p><p>The average LOS in this study was 11.23 days, which was below the average of
S&#x000e3;o Paulo in 2012 (13.29 days)<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. However, prolonged stay (LOS&#x0003e;7days) occurred in
69.5% of the patients.</p><p>Another study on isolated CABGs and those associated with other procedures in 2010 in
the same institution under study found a mean LOS of 11 days, with prolonged stay in
62.67% of the patients<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In these two years (2010 and 2012), there was no significant difference in the mean
of LOS, but the percentage of prolonged stay increased by 6.83%, thus making a more
detailed study of this population very interesting.</p><p>Comparing the total average cost of hospitalization between groups according to the
LOS, there was a significant increase in the cost for Group 2 (group with LOS&#x0003e;7
days), (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001), and although the transferred funds were
greater for this group, it was noticed that Group 1 (group with LOS less than or
equal to 7 days) had a higher coverage percentage of the total average cost (Group 1
had 58.09% <italic>vs.</italic> Group 2 with 44.52%).</p><p>Therefore, this demonstrates that the higher the LOS, the higher the cost and the
funds transferred from SUS (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). However, the funds
transferred were not proportional to the cost, thereby resulting in an increasingly
negative percentage difference of revenue for each increase in cost and hospital
stay.</p><p>When comparing the average coverage of the funds transferred per patient in the
present study with that of a study published in 2013<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>, the coverage was around
45 to 52%. In the present study, the coverage was 48.66% of the costs. In the cited
study<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>,
the coverage in increasing order of mortality risk by the additive EuroSCORE (low,
medium and high)<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>
was 52.75%, 46.53% and 45.21%, respectively. In both works, an increase in
hospitalization increased the cost and the value of funds transferred from SUS;
however, the increase in the transferred funds did not proportionately follow the
increase in total cost, with the coverage percentage decreasing at each increase in
LOS and cost.</p><p>CABG costs have increased over time due to technological advances. However, even
though the funds transferred from SUS have increased, they remain insufficient and
cover just about half of hospital costs. This mismatch between cost and funds being
transferred can cause financial losses to healthcare institutions, which are
contracted with SUS throughout the country, compromising their market survival and
their ability to meet the population's demand. This characterizes the problem of the
arduous financial question inherent in health institutions to accomplish this
complex procedure.</p><p>The data of this study corroborate the affirmation of some authors that, in relation
to the destination of government funds for public health expenditures, the transfer
of funds from SUS is out of date and insufficient to cover the costs of performed
surgical procedures, and this scenario may worsen with the increase in the number of
cardiovascular surgeries<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In view of this, the question arises as to the need to seek strategies for managing
and reducing costs, such as reducing LOS, increasing bed rotation and increasing
attending demand, in line with SUS principles of accessibility for patients. It is
necessary to review health policies in government offices for contracting the value
of the funds transferred from SUS, ensuring the financial integrity of hospital
institutions.</p><p>When comparing the groups' preoperative profile according to LOS in an attempt to
justify the increase in hospital stay and cost, the mortality risk expected by the
EuroSCORE calculation<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> did not differ between groups. However, in relation to
the preoperative factors, Group 2 had a higher age, a greater number of diabetics,
and chronic kidney disease patients. Data from a Brazilian study also identified the
presence of diabetes and kidney disease, among others, as factors that increased
hospital stay<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Group 2 presented the highest number of postoperative complications, which shows that
the presence of complications is related to the increase in hospital stay,
corroborating data from a Brazilian study<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> and the cost. An American study of 65,534
patients analyzed the cost of postoperative morbidity from cardiac surgeries
performed from 2001 to 2011, and concluded that postoperative complications impact
increased hospital stay and costs<sup>[<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>. Other authors have also stated that prolonged
postoperative hospitalization may contribute to increased severity, reduction of
functional capacity and productivity<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>, affect family budgets, the patient's
quality of life and generate an increase in public spending in
general<sup>[<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Group 2 patients, although not more severe according to the EuroSCORE, remained
longer than the protocol of the institution under study. However, this considered
increased hospitalization is related to the presence of more advanced age,
comorbidities such as diabetes and chronic kidney disease, and a greater number of
postoperative complications; a finding similar to that presented by other
studies<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>New Brazilian studies on the coverage of funds transferred from SUS for the total
hospitalization costs in elective isolated CABGs will be necessary for a real
comparability with the data of this research, and may contribute to having more
parameters on health costs in Brazil.</p><sec><title>Limitations of the Study</title><p>Since this is a study with a database, only three cost variables (total cost,
funds transferred by SUS and the difference between revenue and cost) were
found.</p><p>Also, information on direct and indirect, fixed and variable costs of the
surgical procedure itself and of each cost center used in patient care were not
found.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Funds transferred from SUS covered less than half the total average hospitalization
costs of CABGs (48.66%). Although the funds transferred from SUS increased according
to costs, these transfers were not proportional to the total cost, resulting in a
percentage difference of increasingly negative revenue with each increase in cost
and hospital stay. The increase in the hospital stay (considered to be prolonged
when LOS is over 7 days) increased the cost, and this group had older patients with
a higher percentage of diabetic and chronic kidney disease patients, and more
postoperative complications.</p><table-wrap id="t6" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="5%" span="1"/><col width="95%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GSS</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Analysis and/or data interpretation;

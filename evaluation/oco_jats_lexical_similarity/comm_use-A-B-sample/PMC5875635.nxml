Accelerometry and movement sensors have become a widely used objective method for quantifying PA levels through their ability to derive information relating to frequency, duration and intensity of PA from actual body movement/acceleration. Although successfully integrated into large-scale studies,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> only a few population level datasets exist using this particular method. Self- or proxy-reported questionnaires remain popular, despite a number of limitations:<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x000a0;4</xref> questionnaire responses depend on perception, encoding, storage and retrieval of information;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and concerns exist over the accuracy of questionnaire data from children under 10&#x02009;years due to their cognitive underdevelopment.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> These concerns translate to poor validity coefficients,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> where a tendency exists for questionnaires to over-report PA levels compared with directly measured PA.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> However, within population surveillance research, a questionnaire approach requires less technical knowledge and expertise and is considered less burdensome than accelerometry. Although cheaper and more practical to administer,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> questionnaires&#x000a0;can be adapted more readily to different delivery methods (ie, postal or face-to face administration), have been developed to suit different population groups (eg, children, adolescents),<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and, finally, they have the ability to extract information on &#x02018;type&#x02019; (eg, sporting activities, play or active living) and &#x02018;domain&#x02019; (eg, school, home, commute) of activity. For these reasons, it is important that they accurately measure the activity being studied. The Youth Physical Activity Questionnaire (YPAQ)<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> is based on the Children&#x02019;s Leisure Activities Study Survey (CLASS);<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and measures frequency, duration, intensity and mode, over the past 7 days, of both PA and sedentary activities throughout all domains. Original validation work was conducted in England with 12&#x02013;13-year-olds and demonstrated acceptable levels of validity compared with accelerometry (r<sub>s</sub>=0.42, p=0.04). With reasonable measurement properties, and with the ability to capture the multiple components of PA, it was decided to employ the YPAQ for this study, specifically within a Scottish population. Prior to commencing a large-scale, country-wide data collection (Studying Physical Activity in Children's Environments across Scotland&#x000a0;(SPACES)), employing both objective and self-reported measures of PA to estimate the prevalence of children meeting the UK Chief Medical Officer's PA guidelines,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> we set out to examine the ability of the YPAQ to accurately capture the main outcome variable used to assess guideline adherence, namely moderate-to-vigorous physical&#x000a0;activity (MVPA). Specifically, we examined the individual level criterion validity and measurement agreement between YPAQ-derived MVPA and accelerometry-derived MVPA (ActiGraph GT3X+;&#x000a0;ActiGraph LLC, Pensacola,&#x000a0;FL, USA) to assess the suitability of YPAQ to measure this outcome variable for inclusion in the SPACES study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>A convenience sample of 90 adolescents (12&#x02013;13&#x02009;years old) from two schools in Central/West Scotland were invited to take part.

Pearson's correlation between the difference and the mean was 0.81, indicating a significant positive linear relationship between these two variables.

In the event of its acceptability, the measure could be translated to testing in the population setting where its purpose would be to estimate the&#x000a0;population prevalence of children meeting the PA guidelines. The results demonstrated that&#x000a0;a moderate linear correlation existed between methods (Pearson's r=0.48; Spearman&#x02019;s r<sub>s</sub>=0.39), although results from the Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated a poor level of agreement, with error between measures dependent on the underlying PA level (r=0.81).</p><p>We were interested in determining whether the YPAQ would be a valid proxy for accelerometry, given that questionnaires could be considered more practical for population surveillance than activity monitors. When used to assess the prevalence of children meeting PA guidelines, Sallis and Saelens<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> have stated the importance of measuring absolute levels of validity. As can be seen from our findings, the agreement between the two methods becomes less evident as MVPA increases (error and overestimation increases), effectively widening the limits of agreement. The YPAQ, although demonstrating acceptable validity through correlational metrics, including the ability to rank individuals' PA, shows systematic bias through the measurement range as demonstrated by the Bland-Altman analyses. We would therefore advise caution if it&#x000a0;is used to extract accurate levels of MVPA to be used in population prevalence estimates.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Comparisons with the original validation work</title><p>The initial validation work undertaken by Corder and colleagues<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> was conducted using a population group (12&#x02013;13&#x02009;year olds; n=25) similar&#x000a0;to that of the present study (12&#x02013;13&#x02009;year olds; n=44). Compared with participants in our study, those in the Corder study recorded 14&#x02009;min/day more in MVPA (72 vs 58&#x02009;min) as measured by accelerometry; median MVPA by YPAQ in the Corder sample was 92&#x02009;min/day compared with 100&#x02009;min/day in our sample. The differences in accelerometry can be explained, to some degree at least, by the particular cut point used in each method (&#x0003e;1952 vs &#x0003e;2295&#x000a0;counts/min), although the use of different ActiGraph models, epoch length from which the MVPA was calculated and processing options, such as non-wear time and total valid time per day, will have also contributed to these differences. YPAQ scores were similar in both studies, indicating some consistency in the measure conducted across different samples and in different years (2005&#x02013;2006 and 2013&#x02013;2014). Furthermore, we found a similar relationship between questionnaire and accelerometer when ranking the data (Spearman&#x02019;s r<sub>s</sub> of 0.42 in the&#x000a0;Corder study vs 0.39 in the current study). This finding provides some support for the ability of the YPAQ to rank PA levels at an individual level.</p><p>Both studies demonstrated a general over-reporting of MVPA by the YPAQ although a stronger, and significant, bias was found in the present study; 22.4&#x02009;min MVPA/week (95% CI &#x02212;155.6 to 200.4) in the Corder sample compared with 25.6&#x000a0;min/day (95% CI 10.4 to 40.9) in the present study. Only our study found that the degree of questionnaire error was dependent on activity level (Pearson correlation of 0.81 vs 0.02), with the complicated pattern observed suggesting under-reporting at lower levels of activity and over-reporting at higher levels. The dependence of error across the measurement range is seldom reported in the literature,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> but it can be seen from the present study that this finding may be considered problematic if it&#x000a0;is used in population surveillance studies where guideline prevalence is of key importance.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Comparisons with other literature</title><p>The literature supports the premise that self-reported/indirect measures of PA may over-report activity levels. In a systematic review conducted by Adamo and colleagues,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> it was found that 72% of the reviewed indirect measures overestimated the directly measured values. Within the same review, correlations ranged from &#x02212;0.56 to 0.89 highlighting both negative and positive relationships between the measures. In contrast to our findings, the review by Adamo and colleagues reported that girls were more likely to overestimate direct values of PA than boys(by 584% vs 114%, girls and boys, respectively). Why we have observed the opposite pattern is unclear, although one potential explanation may be that football and running were more commonly recorded among boys&#x02014;often with large and extreme values.</p><p>The ability of the YPAQ to successfully rank MVPA is supported by a number of recent reviews on self-reported measures.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 26</xref> However, having the ability to rank PA is different to its ability to be used accurately as a surrogate for PA prevalence. Helmerhorst and colleagues in their recent review suggested that &#x02018;despite considerable effort, accurate and precise self-report physical activity instruments are still scarce&#x02019;.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The reduction of a complex multidimensional construct (PA) into a single metric, potentially misleading understandings of what criterion methods are and, importantly, a lack of a comprehensive measurement framework have been cited as potential reasons for the inconsistencies seen in the literature.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> We have to consider the participants themselves when we discuss inconsistency. Feedback from our fieldworkers suggested that many participants struggled with the concept of frequency and duration of activities. Cognitive immaturity, including memory recall, and the comprehension of questionnaire content can be problematic in youth.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Future work will collect data from 10-year-old children, and will be self-administered rather than interviewer/fieldwork administered. Our experience in this study&#x02014;with older children&#x02014;suggests that issues may arise over comprehension of the YPAQ, and consequently affect data quality. A recent review<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> assessed 89 PA measures for their applicability to population surveillance and identified a small group of measures that received scientific and expert support. One of these measures, the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Children (PAQ-C)<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> may address the memory and comprehension issues faced within this study by assessing general levels of PA rather than trying to ascertain all facets of the behaviour.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This study endeavoured to replicate the original design conducted by Corder and colleagues,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> including similar participant ages and statistical approach. A strong scientific approach, particularly in measurement studies, is one where previous work is replicated, challenged, supported or refuted. This is especially true when employing different population groups in different settings. By doing so, greater confidence in the YPAQ's validation properties can be expected. As advocated in the literature,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> we have been clear with regard to the measurement purpose, derivation of our outcome and analysis. Furthermore, this study tried to improve data quality by allocating significant time and resources to the process, including the employment of fieldworkers to actively supervise questionnaire completion.</p><p>One limitation of our study is that our sample size lacked the power to detect subgroup differences (eg, by gender), as 52% (n=46) of the participants did not meet the accelerometry inclusion criteria. Additionally, our decision to include children with 3&#x02009;days of valid PA may not have been sufficient enough to provide an accurate representation of daily PA.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Moreover, these valid days may not have included a weekend day, which often involve less wear time, and PA levels, than weekdays.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Therefore, compared with the YPAQ, which asks participants to recall based on the &#x02018;previous 7 days&#x02019;, we may have introduced error into the analyses and inflated the level of MVPA as measured by accelerometry. Even so, there remained a significant overestimation of the YPAQ against the accelerometer. Furthermore, the accelerometers were worn during the waking hours and removed only for water-based activities and contact activities. As such, some activities (eg, swimming or rugby) may not have been recorded. Additionally, some activities (eg, cycling) may have been misclassified due to the placement of the accelerometer. This information could be included in future studies through the addition of self-reported cycling time; doing so may reduce the size of the overestimation.</p><p>In summary, although moderately correlated, these two methods should not be used interchangeably as agreement was poor, with error in the measurement highly dependent on activity level. From a practical perspective, the face-to-face administration of the YPAQ highlighted a number of concerns, and its employment in population surveillance (where a face-to face delivery may not be possible) to extract individual level MVPA should be considered carefully. Conversely, if a suitable standardised error was identified and adjusted for, then the YPAQ could be a cheaper, more practical way to measure PA if methods were employed to improve in situ participant comprehension.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> PRWM was responsible for the original idea, with all authors contributing to the analytical approach.

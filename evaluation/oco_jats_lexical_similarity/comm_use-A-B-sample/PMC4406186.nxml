Higher concentrations of silicon are suggested to be associated with bone and the connective tissues, compared with the non-connective soft tissues. Moreover, in connective tissues it has been suggested that silicon levels may decrease with age based upon analyses of human aorta. These claims, however, have not been tested under controlled conditions. Here connective and non-connective tissues were collected and analysed for silicon levels from female Sprague&#x02013;Dawley rats of different ages (namely, 3, 5, 8, 12, 26 and 43&#x000a0;weeks; n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;8&#x02013;10 per age group), all maintained on the same feed source and drinking water, and kept in the same environment from weaning to adulthood. Tissues (696 samples) were digested in nitric acid and analysed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry for total silicon content. Fasting serum samples were also collected, diluted and analysed for silicon. Higher concentrations of silicon (up to 50-fold) were found associated with bone and the connective tissues compared with the non-connective tissues. Although <italic>total</italic> silicon content increased with age in all tissues, the highest connective tissue silicon <italic>concentrations</italic> (up to 9.98&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/g wet weight) were found in young weanling rats, decreasing thereafter with age (by 2&#x02013;6 fold). Fasting serum silicon concentrations reflected the pattern of connective tissue silicon concentrations and, both measures, when compared to collagen data from a prior experiment in Sprague&#x02013;Dawley rats, mirrored type I collagen turnover with age. Our findings confirm the link between silicon and connective tissues and would imply that young growing rats have proportionally higher requirements for dietary silicon than mature adults, for bone and connective tissue development, although this was not formally investigated here. However, estimation of total body silicon content suggested that actual Si requirements may be substantially lower than previously estimated which could explain why absolute silicon deficiency is difficult to achieve but, when it is achieved in young growing animals, it results in stunted growth and abnormal development of bone and other connective tissues.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="u0005"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Silicon may be important for bone and connective tissue health.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Higher silicon concentrations are found in connective tissues.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Highest concentrations are found in young weanling rats and decreases with age.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Young growing rats may have higher requirements for silicon than adults.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Total body silicon content suggests requirement is lower than previously estimated.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Collagen</kwd><kwd>Connective tissues</kwd><kwd>Growth &#x00026; development</kwd><kwd>Whole body Si content</kwd><kwd>Silicon status</kwd><kwd>Silicon requirement</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0005"><title>Introduction</title><p>Silicon (Si) is a natural trace element of the mammalian diet and although it has not been demonstrated <italic>unequivocally</italic> that mammals have a requirement for Si <xref rid="bb0005 bb0010" ref-type="bibr">[1,2]</xref> there is increasing evidence to suggest that it may be important for the normal health of bone and the connective tissues <xref rid="bb0010 bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[2,3]</xref>. Indeed, severe dietary Si deprivation in growing animals appears to cause abnormal growth and defects of the connective tissues <xref rid="bb0020 bb0025" ref-type="bibr">[4,5]</xref>. Whilst these dramatic effects have not been replicated in the more recent studies, some effects on bone have been reported <xref rid="bb0030 bb0035 bb0040 bb0045 bb0050 bb0055 bb0060 bb0065 bb0070 bb0075" ref-type="bibr">[6&#x02013;15]</xref>. Moreover, Jugdaohsingh et al. <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> reported that rats on a Si-deprived diet actively conserve Si by reabsorption of urinary Si to maintain tissue Si levels. Silicon responsive genes have been identified from the kidneys of the Si-deprived rats <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In humans, higher dietary Si intakes are associated with optimal bone health and this appears to be mediated by oestrogen status <xref rid="bb0090 bb0095" ref-type="bibr">[18,19]</xref>. The exact role of Si, however, is not known. A number of potential roles have been suggested including an involvement in DNA synthesis and in increasing/improving the utilisation of essential elements involved in bone and connective tissue health <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Silicon has a unique affinity for aluminium (Al), preventing its absorption in animals and humans <xref rid="bb0105 bb0110" ref-type="bibr">[21,22]</xref> and it has also been proposed that it may bind and sequester toxic Al ions that may have detrimental effects on bone health <xref rid="bb0115 bb0120" ref-type="bibr">[23,24]</xref>.</p><p>However, much of the evidence points to an direct involvement of Si in extracellular matrix synthesis and/or its stabilisation, particularly so for collagen which is one of the main structural proteins of bone and connective tissues <xref rid="bb0015 bb0120" ref-type="bibr">[3,24]</xref>. Higher levels of Si are reported to be associated with healthy connective tissues (e.g. aorta, bone, trachea, tendon etc.), and especially their connective tissue components (i.e. collagen and elastin), compared to non-connective tissues (e.g. liver, kidney, spleen etc.) <xref rid="bb0125 bb0130 bb0135" ref-type="bibr">[25&#x02013;27]</xref>. Work by Alder and Berlyne using 31-labelled Si similarly showed that although much (~&#x000a0;80%) of the Si was excreted in urine following injection, some was retained by the tissues, with high levels in skin and bone <xref rid="bb0140 bb0145" ref-type="bibr">[28,29]</xref>.</p><p>The concentration of Si in connective tissues is suggested to decrease with age and with disease progression, based upon data for the human aorta <xref rid="bb0135 bb0150" ref-type="bibr">[27,30]</xref>. Fasting serum Si concentrations may also decrease with age, with higher concentrations in newborns, infants, toddlers and young children and lower concentrations in adolescents and adults <xref rid="bb0155 bb0160" ref-type="bibr">[31,32]</xref>. Fasting serum Si concentrations could, therefore, be an indicator of connective tissue Si levels. However, these putative associations, namely (i) silicon's change in concentration with age in connective tissues, (ii) the change in fasting serum Si concentration with age and (iii) that the latter may reflect connective tissue levels, have not been assessed in a formal, controlled longitudinal setting. Indeed, whether Si definitely targets connective tissues, in preference to the major soft tissues/organs that often accumulate trace minerals (e.g. liver, lung and kidney), has not been assessed with modern analytical techniques.</p><p>In this work we have revisited the question of the levels of Si in the connective tissues (aorta, bone, trachea, etc.) versus non-connective tissues (kidney and liver) in a prospective controlled study and used modern, robust analytical methods. In addition, we have investigated whether levels of Si in the connective (and non-connective tissues) do indeed change with age, between weaning and adulthood, and seen how this compares to fasting serum Si levels. Finally, comparison was made between serum Si level's and a serum marker of type I collagen turnover, namely serum carboxy terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTx) to determine whether fasting serum Si is an indicator of collagen (connective tissue) turnover.</p><p>Note, this study did not set out to measure the distribution of Si in the rat's tissues, hence some tissues including brain, muscle and adipose tissue were not collected and analysed for Si. Previous analysis, however, showed that these tissues are unlikely to contain high levels of Si <xref rid="bb0125 bb0145" ref-type="bibr">[25,29]</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s0010"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="materials" id="s0015"><title>Materials</title><p>Needles and syringes were from Terumno (Terumno Europe NV).

Firstly, this would allow direct comparison with previous studies <xref rid="bb0125 bb0135" ref-type="bibr">[25,27]</xref> that reported Si levels in connective tissues (as per gramme wet weight of tissue) and secondly, it avoids (i) the pitfalls in drying tissues consistently and without introducing contaminant Si and (ii) the potential errors in handling the very low mass of dried tissues.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0065"><title>Body silicon content</title><p>Silicon concentrations of the rat tissues were used to calculate/estimate the body Si content of the rat at the different ages for the tissues assessed.

The gastrointestinal tract may have variable levels depending upon (i) recent absorption and (ii) presence or absence of silicate particles <xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, although these are not contributors to the steady state body pool of Si and should be ignored for that purpose.</p></sec><sec id="s0070"><title>Serum CTx</title><p>Serum CTx (carboxy terminal telopeptide of type I collagen) concentrations were obtained from our previous study using rats of the same strain and gender, i.e. female Sprague&#x02013;Dawley rats <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.

In all four tissues, an increase in <italic>total</italic> Si content was observed with age. In other words, whilst tissue Si concentrations falls with age (excluding the liver), the increase in organ size with growth means that absolute Si content (mass) actually increases with age (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>). However, the extent of the increase differed markedly between tissues.

Bone and skin accounted for 75&#x02013;87% of the Si content measured, across the age range and, collectively, connective tissues accounted for 80&#x02013;89% of the measured Si content. The analysed tissues however only account for ~&#x000a0;36% of the rat's body mass (Supplemental Tables 2 &#x00026; 3). Muscle and other tissues were not analysed but are expected to be low in Si. Carlisle <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, reported on the Si content of muscle tissue from 4&#x000a0;months (16&#x000a0;weeks) old male rats (specie not specified) and since muscle accounts for a large portion (~&#x000a0;40%) of rat's body mass we estimated how much additional Si it could contribute to the total body Si content of the rat. In general, tissue Si values reported by Carlisle were higher than ours, so we first calculated the relative fold difference between our values, from the 12-week and 26-week old female rats (since we did not have 16-week old rats), and those reported by Carlisle <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> for skin, heart and liver (tissues with similar Si concentration to muscle) and then applied this adjustment (mean relative fold difference of 4.3 for both the 12 and 26&#x000a0;week old rats) to the muscle Si value reported by Carlisle to obtained an estimated Si concentration for muscle of 0.754&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/g wet weight and 0.753&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/g wet weight, respectively for the 12 and 26-week old rats. Taking into account that muscle contributes 40% to the rat's body weight, we estimated that Si from the rat muscle tissue would contribute an additional 64.8&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g (42%) and 75.3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g (42%) Si to the total body Si content of the 12 and 26-week old rats, respectively. However, bone and skin are still the largest contributors to total body Si content of the 12 and 26&#x000a0;week old rats, at 50.1 and 48.7%, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s0105"><title>Correlations with collagen turnover</title><p>Serum CTx, a marker of type I collagen turnover, collected from a previous study <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, more or less mirrored the changes in serum Si concentrations with age (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;6</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s0110"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this prospective, longitudinal and carefully controlled study we have confirmed the original proposals of (a) Carlisle <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, (b) Loeper et al. <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> and (c) Jugdaohsingh et al. <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, namely that (a) Si is associated with connective tissues, (b) connective tissue Si concentrations decrease with age and (c) that fasting serum Si is a good marker of the body pool of Si (i.e. connective tissue Si concentrations). However, a number of other important and novel findings were also obtained in this work and these are discussed below.<list list-type="simple"><list-item id="o0030"><label>(1)</label><p>Total Si concentrations of all tissues, including the connective tissues, are lower than previously reported <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, although the 4&#x02013;5 fold proposed difference in Si concentration, between the connective and non-connective tissues of adult rats, was observed here. Difference in absolute levels is most likely due to improvements with modern methodology, for the preparation and analysis of Si that has occurred over the last 30&#x02013;40&#x000a0;years. However, in the case of bone there is some evidence that differences in diet composition may influence the loading of Si into bone mineral <xref rid="bb0080 bb0225" ref-type="bibr">[16,45]</xref> and thus affect total bone Si concentration. There is no evidence that this is similarly true for other connective tissues <xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, but it remains possible that both differing environments (e.g. dietary Si exposure) and analytical methodology contribute to differences in historical and contemporary measures of tissue Si levels. The lack of methodological detail in the previous studies makes this difficult/impossible to resolve.</p></list-item><list-item id="o0035"><label>(2)</label><p>Although there is no <italic>unequivocal</italic> evidence that mammals have a requirement for Si, estimation of total body Si content suggests that absolute Si requirements may be substantially lower than previously assumed, including for humans <xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. This was not, however, a primary objective of this study. When the total Si concentrations, acquired here, were used to estimate tissue Si contents and then whole body Si content of the rat, the amount of Si that may be required during growth/development was much lower than might have previously been assumed (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>), even if the estimated Si contribution from muscle tissue is included. Indeed, the difference in total body Si content between weanling (3-week old) and adult (26&#x000a0;week old) rats is less than 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g and 50% of this is acquired within the first 13&#x000a0;days after weaning. This (potential) very low requirement for Si may explain why so many Si deficiency studies, since Carlisle <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and Schwarz &#x00026; Milne <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, have failed to achieve frank Si deficiency, including the most comprehensive study to date where an extremely low dietary Si level was achieved (2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g Si/g diet) albeit clearly not low enough <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. It is possible, however, that in the studies of Carlisle <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and Schwarz &#x00026; Milne <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> the animals did not receive an optimal diet for growth and development and thus the addition of Si may have had a pharmacological effect.</p><p>When the rat tissue Si values are extrapolated to an adult human based upon relative weights, then total body Si content amounts to only ~&#x000a0;30&#x000a0;mg (or ~&#x000a0;49&#x000a0;mg when the estimated Si contribution from muscle tissue is included), very much less that the 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;g that has been suggested to be present in the average human adult <xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. This may imply that Si requirement in humans is lower (i.e. 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;mg or less) than previously assumed (10&#x02013;25&#x000a0;mg Si/d based on 24&#x000a0;h urinary Si excretion; 46) and may explain why a Si deficiency state or condition (disorder) has not been reported for humans. The ubiquitous presence of Si in our diet and in our environment makes it inconceivable for humans to become chronically deficient in Si. This finding of a lower requirement for Si is in agreement with a recent Si balance study in humans, showing that urinary and faecal Si excretions over 24&#x000a0;h can fully account for the total Si consumed (24&#x000a0;mg Si/d) in individuals who are in &#x02018;Si balance' <xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Although this study gave no indication whether any of the absorbed and urinary excreted Si had undergone exchange with the body Si pool, it is unlikely to be a high proportion <xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Analysis of adult human tissues (bone, skin, liver, muscle and serum at the very least) will give a more accurate indication of Si requirement in adult humans. We expect it to be lower or not different to the above estimate. Silicon requirements in children are probably much higher (see below).</p><p>This proposal of a lower requirement for Si in humans appears not to fit with our previous observational data reporting higher intakes of dietary Si to be associated with higher bone mineral density (BMD, a measure of bone strength) and thus better bone health <xref rid="bb0090 bb0095" ref-type="bibr">[18,19]</xref>. We can provide two possible explanations for this apparent discrepancy. One possibility is that our estimate of total body Si content for humans is incorrect. Humans are not the same as rats and thus it&#x02019;s possible that rat tissue Si levels are not representative of the levels in humans. Hence, adult humans may have a higher requirement for Si than adult rats and thus higher intakes of dietary Si provides optimal Si intake with regards to bone health. Another possible and, we believe, more likely explanation is that Si has two roles. Silicon may have an &#x02018;essential&#x02019; role in connective tissues with regards to collagen health, and the amount of Si required for this role is minimal (small), as recently indicated from the direct quantification of Si in the collagen fraction of the rat bone <xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. This small amount of Si (associated with collagen) appears to be conserved in rats under different level of dietary Si exposure <xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Under chronic dietary Si deprivation, we have previously reported that rats conserve their tissue Si levels by reducing their urinary output of Si <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Silicon may also have a second role, a &#x02018;pharmacological&#x02019; role, in bone at least. This occurs through the incorporation of Si into the mineral fraction of bone, improving trabecular bone BMD and other bone quality measures <xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. This pharmacological effect is mediated systemically and is influenced by circulating levels of estradiol <xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. This pharmacological effect would explain the association between dietary Si intakes and BMD in humans and also the lack of tail-off in this relationship at the upper quintile of Si intake (30&#x02013;63&#x000a0;mg/day) for men and pre-menopausal women <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p></list-item><list-item id="o0040"><label>(3)</label><p>Our data suggest that young growing rats may have proportionally higher requirements for dietary silicon than adult rats. The higher concentrations of Si in the fasting serum and connective tissues of young rats, and the similar reported findings in humans <xref rid="bb0135 bb0155 bb0160" ref-type="bibr">[27,31,32]</xref> suggest that young mammals may have a higher requirement for Si, for bone and connective tissue development (see below).</p></list-item><list-item id="o0045"><label>(4)</label><p>Fourthly, fasting serum and connective tissue Si concentrations may be markers of collagen (connective tissue) turnover. Here, fasting serum Si and connective tissue Si concentrations mirrored type I collagen turnover with age and a similar good fit between bone Si and bone hydoxyproline (collagen) concentrations (Supplementary Fig. 1) suggests that both fasting serum Si and bone Si concentrations may be biomarkers of collagen (connective tissue) turnover. Certainly bone and connective tissue turnover is higher in young rats, starting prenatally (mid-gestation embryonic day 14), peaking between postnatal days 7&#x02013;21 and then decreasing rapidly thereafter to a stable level by postnatal days 30&#x02013;40 (Refs. <xref rid="bb0245 bb0250 bb0255" ref-type="bibr">[49&#x02013;51]</xref>). Bone collagen content and mechanical strength of the collagen matrix increases until three months of age in rabbits, when it attains maturity and prior to overall skeletal maturity at around 6&#x000a0;months <xref rid="bb0260 bb0265" ref-type="bibr">[52,53]</xref>.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The above findings deserved further investigation in studies that include younger rats for example (&#x0003c;&#x000a0;3&#x000a0;week old), as there is evidence from human studies that the peak of Si concentration may occur earlier and possibly in gestation <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In hindsight, muscle tissue and, probably also, adipose tissue, brain, and gastrointestinal organs should be collected and analysed for Si content to obtain a more accurate estimate of whole body Si level in the rat. Collectively the above findings also provide further evidence that Si is involved in bone and connective tissue development. Exactly what its role is remains unclear, although involvement in collagen synthesis and/or stabilisation seems likely <xref rid="bb0015 bb0120 bb0125" ref-type="bibr">[3,24,25]</xref>. Our recent report showing localisation of Si in the collagen fraction of the rat bone at a molar ratio of 1:6 Si:collagen, independent of the animal's age, supports a structural role for Si, as a cross-link between collagen units <xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. The nature of this interaction, between Si and collagen, is not known but the ex vivo demonstration of complexation between Si(OH)<sub>4</sub> and sugars and hydroxyl-amino acids <xref rid="bb0270 bb0275 bb0280 bb0285" ref-type="bibr">[54&#x02013;57]</xref>, suggests this is a real possibility. Potential binding sites for Si in collagen and other biomolecules have been proposed <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>Finally, an interesting finding of this study was that Si seems to accumulate in the liver with age. Total Si content (and Si concentration) of the rat liver increased markedly with age and in the adult rat (26&#x000a0;week old) the liver accounts for ~&#x000a0;4% of total body Si content and a similar figure was estimated for the adult human male liver. It is known that the liver is involved in the metabolism of silica nanoparticles and silicone released from silicone-filled implants <xref rid="bb0290 bb0295 bb0300" ref-type="bibr">[58&#x02013;60]</xref>. For example, following intravenous or intraperitoneal injection of silica nanoparticles, Si accumulates in the liver and spleen via physical sequestered by macrophages, and this has been well characterised <xref rid="bb0295 bb0300" ref-type="bibr">[59,60]</xref>. However, little is known/reported about the accumulation of dietary (or oral) silica in the liver. Dietary silicon is mainly in the form of soluble silica [Si(OH)<sub>4</sub>] or amorphous polymeric silica (phytolithic silica), and the latter, from the cereal (plant) component of the diet, requires breakdown in the gastrointestinal tract prior to absorption as Si(OH)<sub>4</sub>, a soluble and neutrally charged specie <xref rid="bb0015 bb0305" ref-type="bibr">[3,61]</xref>. Thus it is unclear why this freely diffusible molecule should accumulate in or have an affinity for the liver. A previous study may provide some clues. Mehard &#x00026; Volcani <xref rid="bb0310" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref> reported that after injection of radiolabelled Si (<sup>31</sup>Si(OH)<sub>4</sub>), <sup>31</sup>Si was taken up in the tissues, including the liver, but was subsequently rapidly released (eliminated), although a small percentage was bound or polymerised by liver cell organelles. A similar fate may thus exist for absorbed Si(OH)<sub>4</sub>. An alternate proposal is that some of the absorbed silica from the rat diet was in the form of nanoparticulate silica and it is this that gets sequestered in the liver.</p></sec><sec id="s0115"><title>Disclosures</title><p>All authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></sec><sec id="s0120"><title>Author's contributions</title><p>Authors' contributions: Study design: RJ and JJP.

The Si content shown accounts for tissues that make-up 36&#x02013;39% of the rat's body mass. &#x02018;Other tissues&#x02019; = the sum of: spleen, ear lobes, heart, trachea, oesophagus, aorta, lungs and kidneys. Silicon levels were not measured, and therefore not shown, for the remaining tissues that make-up the rest of the rat's body weight, namely muscle at 40%, adipose tissue at 7%, brain at 0.6%, gastrointestinal organs at 2.7% and miscellaneous (rest of rat body) at 5.7% (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Supplemental Table&#x000a0;2</xref>). Silicon level in muscle tissue has previously been reported for 4-month (16-week) old male rats <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> and since muscle is the largest contributor to body mass, this reported value was used (after adjustment for relative differences in Si values between studies; see Results) to estimate how much Si muscle could contribute to total body Si content of the rat. Silicon content in muscle tissue was found to contribute an additional 64.8&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g (or 42%) and 75.3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g (42%) to the total body Si content of the 12 and 26-week old female rats, respectively. However, bone and skin are still the largest contributors to total body Si content of the 12 and 26&#x000a0;week old rats, at 50.1 and 48.7%, respectively. Gastrointestinal contents account for 5% of total body weight (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Supplemental Table&#x000a0;2</xref>), but are not relevant to systemic (body) Si levels. Insert graph shows the measured Si content as a function of age with the x-axis as a linear scale.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr5"/></fig><fig id="f0030"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;6</label><caption><p>Mean type I collagen turnover, measured as C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTx) in fasting serum of female Sprague&#x02013;Dawley rats of different ages (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5 rats per age group; ref. <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>) compared with fasting serum Si levels measured in this study (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;8&#x02013;10 rats per age group).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr6"/></fig><table-wrap id="t0005" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Ages, numbers and life stages of the female Sprague&#x02013;Dawley rats.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="3" align="left">Rat age<hr/></th><th align="left">Life stage</th></tr><tr><th align="left">(days)</th><th align="left">(weeks)</th><th align="left">n</th><th align="left"/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">23</td><td align="char">3.3</td><td align="char">10</td><td align="left">Weanling</td></tr><tr><td align="left">39</td><td align="char">5.6</td><td align="char">8</td><td align="left">Puberty<xref rid="tf0005" ref-type="table-fn">a</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left">56</td><td align="char">8</td><td align="char">8</td><td align="left">Sexual maturity<xref rid="tf0005" ref-type="table-fn">a</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left">87</td><td align="char">12.4</td><td align="char">10</td><td/></tr><tr><td align="left">184</td><td align="char">26.3</td><td align="char">10</td><td align="left">Social maturity</td></tr><tr><td align="left">302</td><td align="char">43.1</td><td align="char">10</td><td/></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tf0005"><label>a</label><p>Rats are sexually mature between 6&#x02013;8&#x000a0;weeks.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><table-wrap id="t0010" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Association between serum Si and tissue Si levels.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"/><th colspan="2" align="left">Pearson correlation coefficients<xref rid="tf0010" ref-type="table-fn">a</xref><hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="left">Serum Si vs.</th><th align="left">r</th><th align="left">p</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Aorta Si</td><td align="char">0.51</td><td align="char">0.00005</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Heart Si</td><td align="char">0.52</td><td align="char">0.00004</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Oesophagus Si</td><td align="char">0.47</td><td align="char">0.0008</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Femur Si</td><td align="char">0.42</td><td align="char">0.001</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Tibia Si</td><td align="char">0.30</td><td align="char">0.020</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Lung Si</td><td align="char">0.34</td><td align="char">0.011</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Liver Si</td><td align="char">&#x02212;&#x000a0;0.46</td><td align="char">0.0004</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tf0010"><label>a</label><p>Pearson correlation (with 2-Tailed <italic>T</italic>-test).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></floats-group></article>

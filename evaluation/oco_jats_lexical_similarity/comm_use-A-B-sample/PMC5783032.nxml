This study, employing robust methodology, hypothesised that there would be a difference in postural control, and spatiotemporal parameters of gait in people with CLBP compared with asymptomatic individuals.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This cross-sectional case&#x02013;control study age-matched and gender-matched 16 CLBP and 16 asymptomatic participants. Participants were assessed barefoot (1) standing, over three 40&#x02009;s trials, under four posture challenging conditions (2) during gait. Primary outcome was postural stability (assessed by root mean squared error of centre of pressure (CoP) displacement (CoP<sub>RMSEAP</sub>) and mean CoP velocity (CoP<sub>VELAP</sub>), both in the anteroposterior direction); gait outcomes were hip range of movement and peak moments, walking speed, cadence and stride length, assessed using force plates and a motion analysis system.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were no differences between groups in CoP<sub>RMSEAP</sub> (P=0.26), or CoP<sub>VELAP</sub> (P=0.60) for any standing condition. During gait, no differences were observed between groups for spatiotemporal parameters, maximum, minimum and total ranges of hip movement, or peak hip flexor or extensor moments in the sagittal plane.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In contrast to previous research, this study suggests that people with mild to moderate CLBP present with similar standing postural control, and parameters of gait to asymptomatic individuals.

Due to the proposed decrease in stride length, walking speed and hip range of movement, hip joint moments are also likely to be decreased in people with CLBP compared with people without.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Researchers have proposed that such gait changes may be an attempt by the individual to reduce pain by reducing: ground reaction forces at heel strike<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>; excessive muscle activity; or joint movement.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Alternatively, differences may be a result of altered proprioceptive feedback<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> or psychological factors associated with CLBP, such as anxiety, fear avoidance and catastrophising.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Psychological factors may lead to adaptation of normal physical activities, such as fast walking, due to the fear of increasing pain. Although gait alterations may initially be protective, such alterations may induce mechanical problems in the long&#x000a0;term, for example, a slower walking produces longer periods of loading on the lumbar spine during gait,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> which may be detrimental to spinal structures in the long&#x000a0;term, whereas shorter periods of loading, thought to be less detrimental, occur during faster walking.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>

Participants with CLBP were recruited from four Physiotherapy Departments in London (UK) (three National Health Service hospitals, one private physiotherapy practice) following clinical referral from general practitioners and consultants as part of a previously reported randomised controlled trial (RCT).<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> During the second half of the recruitment period of the RCT, 55 participants were asked to participate in the current study, 38 of which showed interest. Eighteen participants could not attend the session in the main due to work commitments. Of the remaining 20&#x000a0;participants, only 16&#x000a0;could be matched by age and gender to our asymptomatic group. Inclusion criteria for symptomatic individuals were: aged 18&#x02013;65 years, with a 3-month or greater history of LBP. Exclusion criteria were constant non-mechanical LBP, lumbar radiculopathy, known spondylolisthesis, spinal stenosis or inflammatory back pain, specific spinal diagnosis inappropriate for physiotherapy interventions (eg, spinal fracture or infection); any condition inappropriate for exercise physiotherapy (eg, severe cardiovascular or metabolic disease) or for wearing rocker&#x000a0;sole footwear (eg, Morton&#x02019;s neuroma, peripheral neuropathy). Potential asymptomatic participants were contacted via email including the Participant Information Sheet, and were asked to contact CSM if they wished to partake in the study. Asymptomatic participants reported no history of LBP in the last year, were required to meet all other inclusion and exclusion criteria presented above. As increasing age is a contributing factor to poorer postural stability<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and gender may influence postural control,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> hence potential confounding factors, asymptomatic participants were matched by age and gender to&#x000a0;symptomatic participants. An age range of 2&#x02009;years above or below the age of the &#x02018;matched&#x02019; CLBP participant was classed as acceptable.

CoP is a term that refers to the mean position of the forces acting under the feet at any instant in time. The RMSE&#x000a0;(or SD) of the CoP position reflects the spread of these measurements over a particular time interval (in this case 30&#x02009;s). The CoP<sub>VELAP</sub> refers to the mean displacement of the CoP&#x000a0;in the anterior-posterior direction, divided by the sample time (1/1080&#x02009;s) over the course of the 30&#x02009;s trial. Reliability of CoP<sub>VEL</sub> has been reported as excellent (intraclass correlation (ICC) 0.8&#x02013;0.95) and CoP<sub>RMSE</sub> reported as fair to good (ICC 0.32&#x02013;0.58) for studies employing similar number of trials and trial durations as the current study.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>

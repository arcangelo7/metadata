However, little is known about how best to engage inactive individuals in sport to increase PA.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
</p><p>It is recognised that PA and sports participation are unequally distributed across society with gender, age, disability, education and socioeconomic status&#x000a0;(SES) as determinants.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Certain subgroups of the population are therefore more likely to be inactive and stand to gain significant health benefits from increasing their PA.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> These groups are frequently considered &#x02018;hard to reach&#x02019;, and as such, it is important to understand how they may be successfully engaged in health-promoting interventions.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Nevertheless, historically there has been a significant recruitment bias in PA interventions that have predominantly recruited white, middle-class, middle-aged women, resulting in under-represented male, socioeconomically disadvantaged and minority ethnic populations.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In light of this, sports interventions are becoming increasingly targeted in attempts to reduce health inequalities and engage underserved populations.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</p><p>In general, academic journals have prioritised the publication of intervention findings above the evaluation and reporting of recruitment processes and outcomes.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> This is limiting because, independent of intervention efficacy, the viability of a programme will be determined by its ability to recruit sufficient numbers of eligible participants.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> This limitation is further exacerbated by the fact that there has been a general lack of evaluation of sports programmes, thus limiting the evidence base on how to engage often hard-to-reach inactive populations in sport.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 11</xref> We argue that a better understanding of recruitment procedures and their effectiveness is needed to inform those wishing to successfully replicate or adapt interventions, particularly when informing policy or practice.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> This review has therefore been undertaken to provide evidence for the role of planning, implementation and reporting of recruitment processes for sports interventions promoting positive PA behaviour change.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Method</title><p>This review systematically identifies and evaluates the effectiveness of recruitment techniques used in interventions aimed at increasing PA using sport. Although the definition of recruitment varies between studies, we have defined &#x02018;recruitment&#x02019; to be those who enrol on an intervention independent of whether they participate. We further define recruitment effectiveness as engaging sufficient numbers of target populations to (1) register for the intervention, (2) participate, (3) complete the intervention or any follow-up, and (4) achieve long-term positive PA behaviour change. Consequently, for the purpose of this review, retention is also considered a component of recruitment effectiveness. From a methodological perspective, the two primary challenges were the identification of reports on PA interventions using sport and the subsequent identification of the recruitment methods used. Hence, the adopted methodology was designed to particularly address these issues.</p><p>Inclusion criteria and analysis methodology were previously specified and documented in a protocol registered as CRD42015015815 (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.asp?ID=CRD42015015815">http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.asp?ID=CRD42015015815).</ext-link>
</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Data sources</title><p>To identify potential studies, searches were conducted using electronic databases, clinical trials registers, grey literature and snowballing from reference lists. This involved a systematic search of the following electronic databases: CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and SPORTDiscus. Then the two primary organisations in England contributing to the delivery of sports programmes for PA and health (Sport England, the national body for sport in England, and UKActive, a not-for-profit health body for the PA sector in the UK) were contacted to identify additional grey literature. Titles and abstracts of identified material were checked against inclusion and exclusion criteria for suitability. Full articles were then acquired and assessed for inclusion. Snowballing was employed whereby, following inclusion, the reference lists of papers were searched and further articles considered for inclusion. The search was completed in November 2015.</p><p>The search terms used were developed using those of earlier systematic reviews on the evaluation of participation outcomes of sporting interventions<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and recruitment into walking interventions<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> combined with an extensive list of sporting activities recognised by Sport England.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Details of the search syntax used for electronic databases are provided in the&#x000a0;online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP4">supplementary appendix</xref>.

<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> in their review of recruitment into walking intervention studies. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of recruitment reporting in the studies regarding where the population was recruited, who conducted the recruitment, the time spent planning and preparing the recruitment, the time spent conducting the recruitment and the target population to be recruited. Each criterion was given a value of zero (absent or inadequately described) or one (explicitly described and present). Using the nomenclature of Foster <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> studies scoring three or below overall were considered &#x02018;low quality&#x02019; while those that scored between four and five were considered &#x02018;high quality&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Assessment of efficiency</title><p>We also adopted the methodology of Foster <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> to evaluate the efficiency of recruitment processes within included studies. This involved calculating the recruitment rates and efficiency ratios, where possible, for each included study. The following values were sought: the total number of potential participants who could be eligible for study (&#x02018;pool&#x02019;), potential participants invited to participate in the study (&#x02018;invited&#x02019;), potential participants who responded to the invitation (&#x02018;responded&#x02019;) and participants who were assessed as eligible to participate and began the programme (&#x02018;started&#x02019;). Where possible, ratios were calculated for each stage, for example, by dividing the number of participants who &#x02018;started&#x02019; the study by the total &#x02018;invited&#x02019; the proportion taking up the intervention.

Furthermore, there is an absence of evidence linking specific recruitment methods to more successful long-term behaviour changes due to a lack of clarity surrounding recruitment channel outcomes. Lack of reported information meant we were also unable to asses the cost per person of recruitment for different recruitment strategies. This would be of particular interest as there is an inevitable cost&#x02013;effect trade-off to be considered when designing recruitment mechanisms.</p><p>We know that reaching priority groups for PA studies, such as the inactive or unhealthy, socioeconomically disadvantaged, ethnic and other minority groups, is challenging.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Our review demonstrates that current recruitment strategies engage predominantly white, middle-class, middle-aged women unless they are clearly designed to target specific demographic characteristics, such as gender or ethnicity. Furthermore, this recruitment bias for particular populations is supported by an earlier review of wider PA interventions.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Our review also found that despite targeting some of these demographic characteristics successfully, interventions tended to achieve unrepresentative levels for the remaining untargeted characteristics such as socioeconomic status. For example, Vahabi and&#x000a0;Damba<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> recruited predominantly Indian women in a South Asian Bollywood dancing intervention. However, most of these women were in full-time employment and had a university degree or higher, suggesting they were of a relatively high socioeconomic status. These findings indicate that typical recruitment techniques adopted by sports PA interventions are not reaching those most in need. Furthermore, targeting specific isolated characteristics may not be sufficient to alleviate recruitment bias towards particular demographic characteristics, thus limiting the generalisability of findings for policy and practice.</p><p>The use of active-only recruitment techniques<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31 36 38</xref> (whereby those involved in the study or programme make the first contact with a participant) appeared to achieve a participant sample with more representative demographic characteristics than passive approaches (ie, prompt potential participants to identify themselves) not targeting specific demographics. This finding is supported by Mutrie <italic>et al</italic>&#x02019;s paper,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> which found that active techniques were less likely to encourage self-selection and introduce recruitment bias than passive techniques. For example, a recruitment and intervention partnership targeting low-income demographics via community health services (active)<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> successfully represented at-risk populations (52% women, 54% white, average income less than 100% of the federal poverty level). However, this study had a 63% non-use attrition rate, thus demonstrating a low conversion to participation. This supports existing evidence that place-based strategies (ie, recruiting participants from a location where they already aggregate) result in more representative samples, but a lower overall participation rate.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 43</xref> There is, however, evidence from the Mangeri <italic>et al</italic> paper<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> that techniques such as motivational interviewing and offering group intervention activities may encourage higher levels of participation in actively recruited participants. These observations highlight the difficulties and tensions faced by sporting interventions for reaching those most at risk or need. Due to insufficient monitoring and evaluation of recruitment processes, we were unable to determine which specific methods were more effective at engaging particular populations.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Setting</title><p>In addition to recruitment mode, the reach of a programme is determined by the appeal of characteristics of the intervention to target participants. Further, research processes such as having to complete questionnaires or wear an accelerometer may also influence uptake and impact recruitment to the programme in general. This review highlights the diversity and effectiveness of a subgroup of interventions delivered in professional football (soccer) clubs for engaging target populations in PA and health-promoting activities.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;21 26</xref> The professional football context in which these programmes were delivered was reported as a powerful draw for participants.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19&#x02013;21 44</xref> Furthermore, the range of populations successfully targeted and recruited by these interventions demonstrates the wide reach of professional sports settings. Using football club facilities, events, branding and media channels were all thought to contribute to the engagement of target groups, extending beyond the fan base of the host club.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> These programmes, therefore, highlight the importance of delivering interventions in contexts that are appealing to their target group and that use pre-existing interests and communities to achieve successful engagement.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Reporting</title><p>The quality of recruitment reporting across included studies was generally classified as poor, with a distinct lack of information on how much time was spent planning and implementing recruitment. The majority of interventions reported using multiple, simultaneous recruitment methods, but only one reported the effectiveness of individual approaches.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Instead, recruitment was largely generalised to a location or setting, thus making it unclear which method or combination of methods were most effective at recruiting particular target groups and achieving long-term behaviour change.</p><p>Higher level overviews of target populations were generally well reported. However, few studies described the pool of potential participants, the number of individuals invited to participate, how many responded and how many started the intervention, all of which were required to calculate recruitment efficiency in accordance with the Foster <italic>et al</italic> review.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> In fact, comparable levels of reporting were seen between studies included in our review and Foster <italic>et al</italic>&#x02019;s,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> thus restricting both reviews&#x02019; ability to compute and compare efficiency ratios across included studies. Further to this, we also sought to investigate some process outcomes that are of interest when looking to translate research into practice: target sample size and the extent to which it was achieved, the eligibility and representativeness of recruited participants as well as their participation and retention in the intervention. Unfortunately, these were also poorly reported, meaning there is limited process-based evidence to inform recruitment designs that facilitate powered and representative sample sizes for rigorous evaluation.</p><p>The need for improved reporting highlighted in this review may in part be driven by a previous lack of agreement on a standard framework for recruitment reporting. In England, a standard evaluation framework (SEF) has recently been introduced to guide programmes to collect and evaluate information relating to PA interventions.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The SEF advocates the monitoring and reporting of a range of recruitment variables as part of its essential criteria for evaluating PA interventions. These include method of recruitment, target population characteristics, measures of the flow of participants through the intervention and dates of crucial time points such as first point of contact and follow-ups. Following adequate execution and reporting of the essential recruitment information, such as those set out in the SEF, the future application of data extraction and scoring procedures attempted within this review would likely produce a greater insight into recruitment processes for sporting interventions aiming to promote PA. We are unaware of similar guidance in other international settings, although these may exist. The level of measurement and reporting observed in this review, however, suggests that standard evaluation of recruitment variables is not being used elsewhere. In the UK, the SEF is a relatively recent document having been published in 2012, and as such its impact may yet to be seen in the academic literature. This may also be the case for other similar guidance, yet if comparable guidance has been in place for longer, our findings raise the question of the extent of its adoption and application.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Strengths and limitations of this review</title><p>The strength of this review is that it used protocols, previously shown to be successful in other reviews, to systematically identify and analyse 23 sport PA intervention papers using a comprehensive search strategy and extensive data extraction table. We also attempted to compute a set of metrics to describe recruitment efficiency that were informed by similar systematic reviews investigating sport or recruitment.</p><p>Regarding limitations, there are limited published or publicly available evaluations of sporting interventions published in English as well as a reluctance from editors to publish articles where recruitment is the prime focus.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> This restricted conclusions relating to a number of processes of interest for this review. In line with the objectives of this study, we assessed the quality of recruitment reporting as our risk of bias tool. An implication of this was that we did not assess the overall quality of the included study. The lack of rigorous recruitment monitoring and reporting meant that the quality of extracted information on recruitment was not enough to allow a meta-analysis to be taken. A further issue in this review was that a number of the programmes considered were designed as research studies and consequently include additional research processes otherwise absent in typical sports interventions. There is evidence that characteristics of the population recruited can be influenced by recruitment protocols, intervention and research design characteristics.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Research protocols may therefore impact recruitment differently to unevaluated sports programmes or those with a lighter-touch evaluation. Consequently, the generalisability of our results was limited by the difficulties of separating the effect of the research and evaluation from overall programme recruitment. Furthermore, extracted values for participant outcomes were limited to only those who participated in the reported evaluation and may not be representative of the complete participant population.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Overall, this review emphasises the need for robust evaluation design and reporting of sports intervention and recruitment processes to permit future evidence-based interventions. There is a growing evidence base for the benefits of sport for physical inactivity and health. However, due to inadequate reporting and evaluation, the mechanisms for achieving effective recruitment and engagement in sport, particularly in hard-to-reach groups, are still unclear. There is a notable tendency of sporting interventions to recruit white, more affluent, middle-aged women. Simply targeting isolated demographic characteristics, such as gender or ethnicity, appears insufficient to recruit a sample representative of the population for the remaining, untargeted characteristics. Combinations of active and passive methods were commonly used, yet active-only recruitment approaches achieved more representative samples for their target population. It is of concern, however, that active-only recruitment may be more vulnerable to limited participant engagement, thus requiring additional components such as motivational interviewing to encourage participation. Independent of recruitment mode, creating an intervention and context that reflect the interests and motivations of the target audience, such as local professional football facilities, presents a promising area.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SP2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjsem-2017-000231.supp2</object-id></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SP3"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjsem-2017-000231.supp3</object-id><caption><title>Supplementary data</title></caption><p>

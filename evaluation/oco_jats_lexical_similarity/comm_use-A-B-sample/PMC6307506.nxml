Future trials may include the REGN-EB3 antibody.</p><p>Prior to the launch of the trial, patients were treated under a compassionate use protocol, with therapeutics that have shown promise and which have a good safety profile in laboratory conditions. Some 160 patients have been treated in this way under an ethical framework called the&#x000a0;Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered and Investigational Interventions. The data in the North Kivu outbreak will likely be insufficient to draw firm conclusions about the treatments. It will therefore be necessary to extend the trials over a period of several years and multiple outbreaks.</p><p>The current trial is coordinated by WHO and led and sponsored by the Democratic Republic of the Congo&#x02019;s National Institute for Biomedical Research, in partnership with its Ministry of Health, the United States&#x02019; National Institutes of Health, the Alliance for International Medical Action and other organizations.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/news-room/detail/26-11-2018-democratic-republic-of-the-congo-begins-first-ever-multi-drug-ebola-trial">http://www.who.int/news-room/detail/26-11-2018-democratic-republic-of-the-congo-begins-first-ever-multi-drug-ebola-trial</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>Royalty-free licence for key hepatitis C treatment</title><p>A new royalty-free licence agreement has been signed between the Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) and pharmaceutical company AbbVie for glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P).

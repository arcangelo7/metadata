Intravenous administration of N-BPs is commonly associated with a flu-like acute-phase reaction involving the activation of V&#x003b3;9V&#x003b4;2 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Kunzmann <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). As V&#x003b3;9V&#x003b4;2 T cells have potent anti-tumoural properties, activation and expansion of V&#x003b3;9V&#x003b4;2 T cells by N-BPs offers a promising strategy for cancer immunotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Bonneville &#x00026; Scotet, 2006</xref>). N-BPs, like dietary alkylamines, activate V&#x003b3;9V&#x003b4;2 T cells through inhibition of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Gober <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Thompson &#x00026; Rogers, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Hewitt <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Thompson <italic>et al</italic>, 2006a</xref>), most likely via an accumulation of the substrates of FPP synthase, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its stereoisomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), which are agonists of the V&#x003b3;9V&#x003b4;2 T cell receptor (TCR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Tanaka <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>). However, the exact cell type in peripheral blood that accumulates IPP/DMAPP after exposure to N-BP remains unknown. Monocytes have previously been shown to be required for activation of V&#x003b3;9V&#x003b4;2 T cells by the N-BP pamidronate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Miyagawa <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>), although the role of monocytes was thought to be direct presentation of N-BP to the V&#x003b3;9V&#x003b4;2 TCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Miyagawa <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). It has since become clear that the activation of V&#x003b3;9V&#x003b4;2 T cells by N-BPs involves intracellular N-BP uptake and IPP/DMAPP accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Gober <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Thompson &#x00026; Rogers, 2004</xref>). We hypothesized that monocytes, due to their high endocytic activity, are the peripheral blood cells that efficiently internalize N-BP and accumulate IPP/DMAPP, and therefore are directly responsible for triggering V&#x003b3;9V&#x003b4;2 T cell activation.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>Zoledronic acid (ZOL) and CGP-58318 (an analogue of ZOL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Legay <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>) were provided by Novartis Pharma AG (Basel, Switzerland).

However, the IPP/DMAPP accumulation in response to pharmacological inhibition of FPP synthase is not well characterized. We used quantitative HPLC-ESI-MS to assess intracellular IPP/DMAPP levels in response to ZOL treatment in J774&#x000b7;2 macrophages. Low concentrations of ZOL (&#x02265;0&#x000b7;5 &#x003bc;mol/l) were sufficient to cause detectable accumulation of IPP/DMAPP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1A</xref>). In addition, the alkylamine sec-butylamine (SBA) also induced IPP/DMAPP accumulation at concentrations &#x02265;5 mmol/l (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1A</xref>). The relatively high concentration of SBA required to induce IPP/DMAPP accumulation correlated with the far lower potency of alkylamines for inhibiting FPP synthase than ZOL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Thompson <italic>et al</italic>, 2006a</xref>). Simultaneous treatment with MEV almost completely prevented the ZOL- or SBA-induced IPP/DMAPP accumulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1A</xref>). These findings provide further evidence for the notion that statins, through inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase upstream of FPP synthase, prevent N-BP- and alkylamine-induced V&#x003b3;9V&#x003b4;2 T cell activation by preventing the accumulation of IPP/DMAPP resulting from FPP synthase inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Gober <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Thompson &#x00026; Rogers, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Hewitt <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Thompson <italic>et al</italic>, 2006a</xref>), and further confirm the mechanism of V&#x003b3;9V&#x003b4;2 T cell activation and proliferation by FPP synthase inhibitors. The accumulation of IPP/DMAPP in J774&#x000b7;2 cells in response to both ZOL and SBA was associated with a concurrent accumulation of the recently identified novel IPP metabolite ApppI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">M&#x000f6;nkk&#x000f6;nen <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), and this was also blocked by MEV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1B</xref>). Whether the metabolism of IPP into ApppI affects the activation of V&#x003b3;9V&#x003b4;2 T cells by N-BPs or alkylamines is presently unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>
<italic>Monocytes accumulate IPP/DMAPP in response to ZOL in human PBMC cultures</italic>
</title><p>To investigate which cell type in peripheral blood is responsible for the IPP/DMAPP accumulation and resulting V&#x003b3;9V&#x003b4;2 T cell activation by N-BPs, we assessed intracellular IPP/DMAPP levels in human PBMC cultures in response to ZOL treatment. IPP/DMAPP could not be detected in untreated cells, but when human PBMCs were pulsed for 2 h with 10 &#x003bc;mol/l ZOL, IPP/DMAPP was clearly detectable in the non-T cell fraction, whereas T cells showed only minor levels of IPP/DMAPP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig S2</xref>). The MS/MS spectrum from the peak in the non-T cell fraction was identical to the MS/MS spectrum of synthetic IPP (not shown). When human PBMCs were pulsed with 1 &#x003bc;mol/l ZOL for 2 h (to mimic the estimated circulating concentration and exposure of peripheral blood cells following a standard dose of ZOL <italic>in vivo</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Chen <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>), ZOL-induced IPP/DMAPP accumulation was clearly detectable in monocytes purified by magnetic bead separation, but hardly detectable in the non-monocyte fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig 1A</xref>). Isolation of monocytes based on cell adherence yielded similar results (not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>
<italic>Peripheral blood monocytes efficiently internalize N-BP</italic>
</title><p>We have shown recently that fluid-phase endocytosis is the major route by which N-BPs are internalized in J774&#x000b7;2 macrophages and osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Thompson <italic>et al</italic>, 2006b</xref>). Since peripheral blood monocytes are highly endocytic, we investigated whether the selective accumulation of IPP/DMAPP in this cell type correlated with relatively high levels of drug uptake. Indeed, in cultures of PBMCs, only CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes internalized large amounts of fluorescently labelled N-BP, while little or no uptake by other cell types, including CD3<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes, could be detected at the concentrations and treatment duration used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig 1B-D</xref>). Similarly, only monocytes internalized large amounts of dextran (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig 1E</xref>), a marker of fluid-phase endocytosis, and confocal microscopy demonstrated intracellular co-localization of fluorescently labelled N-BP with dextran (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig 1F</xref>). This suggests that N-BP uptake by peripheral blood monocytes, similar to that by J774&#x000b7;2 macrophages and osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Thompson <italic>et al</italic>, 2006b</xref>), predominantly occurs via fluid-phase endocytosis. Together, these findings indicate that, following an intravenous infusion of ZOL, only highly endocytic monocytes in peripheral blood are likely to internalize sufficient ZOL to cause a significant accumulation of IPP/DMAPP.</p></sec><sec><title>

</title><p>Having shown that monocytes accumulate detectable levels of IPP/DMAPP following treatment with a clinically relevant pulse of ZOL (1 &#x003bc;mol/l for 2 h), we investigated whether purified peripheral blood monocytes pretreated with the same concentration and duration of ZOL activated V&#x003b3;9V&#x003b4;2 T cells in co-cultures with untreated (monocyte-depleted) PBMCs. ZOL-treated monocytes induced a 2&#x000b7;5 &#x000b1; 1&#x000b7;2-fold (<italic>n</italic> = 3) increase in IFN-&#x003b3; release when co-cultured with monocyte-depleted PBMCs, as compared to co-culture of monocyte-depleted PBMCs with vehicle-treated monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig 2A</xref>), although this did not reach statistical significance. The increase in IFN-&#x003b3; correlated with a 2&#x000b7;1 &#x000b1; 0&#x000b7;5-fold (<italic>n</italic> = 3) increase (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0&#x000b7;05) in V&#x003b4;2<sup>+</sup> T cell number after a 7 d culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig 2B</xref>), and an increase in cell clustering (not shown) in co-cultures with ZOL-treated monocytes as compared to co-cultures with vehicle treated-monocytes. Both IFN-&#x003b3; release and V&#x003b4;2<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation were prevented when the monocyte-depleted PBMCs were separated from monocytes using transwell inserts, indicating that cell&#x02013;cell contact is required for the activation of V&#x003b3;9V&#x003b4;2 T cells by ZOL-treated monocytes.</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Fig 2</label><caption><p>Activation of V&#x003b3;9V&#x003b4;2 T cells by ZOL-treated monocytes.

These findings provide a novel explanation for why monocytes are essential for V&#x003b3;9V&#x003b4;2 T cell activation by N-BPs, and suggest that monocytes, following exposure to ZOL, can directly activate V&#x003b3;9V&#x003b4;2 T cells in a cell contact-dependent manner.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Mrs. Denise Tosh and Mrs. Pat Crombie for technical assistance, Mrs. Linda Duncan for assistance with flow cytometry, and Dr. K.

Many factors, such as acute ischemia, anoxia, and inflammatory factors, may induce multi-tissue damage in some internal organs after severe burn injury. Tissue damage in these internal organs has proven to be responsible for aggravation of disease, the development of complications, and increased mortality. Better prevention and timely rehabilitation and reconstruction of those important internal organs are critical for improving survival and reducing mortality. After severe scalding, the ischemic injury that occurs in the organs and the repair process does not attract public attention due to the lack of macroscopic evidence, the wide range of effects, the number of organs involved, its complex/concealed pathogenesis, and the ineffective repair-promoting measures used.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] In the past, various measures were taken that targeted certain stages of pathogenesis or alleviated the degree of injury; however, they did not repair cells directly. Thus, they did not contribute to the initiation of organ repair. Therefore, investigating how to accelerate and enhance the initial repair of injured organs has become critical for successfully rescuing severely scalded patients and to prevent/treat the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and multiple system organ failure (MSOF) that occur later. It is an important research topic in medicine and is of great theoretical/clinical significance.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="2">Access this article online</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2">

The rhMG53 protein can recognize the external signals at the injured membrane sites and increase membrane resealing in cultured muscle and non-muscle cells when added to the culture medium. Animal studies have shown that application of rhMG53 via multiple routes (intramuscular, intravenous, or subcutaneous) improves the membrane repair capacity of skeletal myocytes and ameliorated muscular dystrophy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]</p><p>Therefore, it is reasonable to propose that exogenous rhMG53 may promote the recovery of damaged cells and repair of injured cell membranes in a burn model.

After scalding, acute ischemia/anoxia occurs in the organs for various reasons, e.g., early stress reactions, changes in vascular permeability, microcirculation disorders, and water/electrolyte/acid-base imbalance.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]</p><p>The kidney is quite sensitive to ischemia/anoxia. After severe scalding, body fluid is lost rapidly, which causes acute renal ischemia/anoxia and a series of significant renal morphological changes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] The epithelial cells of the renal tubule are very vulnerable to ischemia/anoxia injury. Due to scald stress and early shock, the renal artery becomes ischemic, and the blood flow redistributes in the kidney, causing ischemia/anoxia in renal histocytes (in particular, some cells of the renal cortex), which further damages the cell membrane and finally causes irreversible injury/death. The necrosis of indigenous renal cells leads to a drop in the number of functional renal units, further affecting kidney function.</p><p>As shown in recent research, the injured cytoplasmic membrane can be repaired via a complex, multiple-step active dynamic reaction process that is mediated by MG53.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] MG53 is one of the unique muscle TRIM-family proteins, and it is expressed only in cardiac/skeletal muscles. It is an essential component of the repair mechanism for membrane injury[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] After membrane injury, MG53 receives the initial signal of membrane injury (i.e., the exposure of membrane lipid molecules).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] Mediated by PTRF, MG53 is then transferred to near the injured membrane in cellular vesicles and is bound to the exposed membrane lipid molecules.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] Third, the vesicles merge with the cytoplasmic membrane to establish the repair process.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] As also shown by previous data, acute membrane-damage signals can be detected by environmental MG53 proteins that then repair the injured cell membrane.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] However, MG53 cannot bind the exposed membrane lipid molecule by itself; thus, one mediating molecule is required at the injury site to anchor MG53 to the exposed lipid. PTRF (also called &#x0201c;cavin-1&#x0201d;) is a docking protein that binds MG53 at the exposed membrane lipid at the injury site during MG53-mediated membrane repair. PTRF is expressed in most organs (except the liver) including the kidney, lung, heart, and the skeletal muscles, among others.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]</p><p>In our mouse model, we observed kidney-specific distribution of exogenous rhMG53. After burn injury, the exogenous rhMG53 significantly alleviated damage to renal tissue, but not that to other internal tissues. At 48 h after damage, histopathological analysis revealed milder renal injury and lower scores for renal tubule lesions in the MG53-treated group compared with the control group. KIM-1 immunohistochemical results also revealed a protective effect of exogenous MG53 in the kidney as KIM-1 expression in the MG53-treated group was significantly lower than in the BSA-treated group. Thus, we believe that after tail vein injection, exogenous rhMG53 arrived selectively at the site of injury in the kidney, in particular, the epithelial cells of the renal tubule, and repaired the injury.</p><p>Based on immunohistochemistry, we noted that exogenous rhMG53 was distributed in mouse kidney (primarily in the epithelial cells of the renal tubule at the subcapsule area and cortex-medulla interface), and the histopathological characteristics of the tissue were significantly improved compared with the control group. Zhu <italic>et al.</italic>, demonstrated that PTRF was expressed in mouse kidney, lung, heart, and skeletal muscles, and MG53 did not aggregate or mediate repair in the injured cells not expressing the endogenous PTRF[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] Based on our immunohistochemistry results, we noted numerous PTRF<sup>+</sup> cells in the kidney of the injured group and there was no distinct difference between the injured and control group. Exogenous rhMG53 protein distributed in the kidney to areas of high PTRF expression. However, exogenous rhMG53 was not distributed significantly in other tissues that expressed less or no endogenous PTRF. All of the above results indicate that the selective distribution and repair mediated by exogenous MG53 correlated closely with PTRF.</p><p>After severe burn injury, many factors can induce multitissue damage in some internal organs. As the basic functional unit of the organism, cells degenerate when the organ is damaged, and the cell membrane is the initial site of damage. MG53 is an acute membrane damage-repair protein. MG53 can reach the membrane damage site quickly with other cofactors after acute damage to complete the injury repair. Exogenous rhMG53 protein injected into the tail vein selectively arrives at tissues where PTRF is highly expressed. Through PTRF and other cofactors, MG53 can repair the membrane damage and reduce organ injury.</p><p>In conclusion, for the first time, we show that exogenous rhMG53 can selectively be distributed to sites in the kidney that show high expression of PTRF, thereby ameliorating histological alterations in renal tissues after severe burn injury. Our data provide a novel mechanism for protecting the kidney from injury that may be important for future treatment of burns in the clinic.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>How to cite this article:</bold> Wu Y, Huang J, Liu D, Tan J, Peng Y, Yang J, Cui Y, He W, Luo G, Wu J.

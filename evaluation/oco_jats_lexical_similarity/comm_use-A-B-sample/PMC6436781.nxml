in the venous system in up to 10% of cases<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. Resection of RCC with inferior vena cava (IVC) tumor
extension poses a challenge with perioperative morbidity and mortality reaching
50%<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Complete surgical
removal remains the only potential hope for a cure. Incomplete resection results in
100% 5-year mortality<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. Extension
of tumor thrombus above the diaphragm or into the right atrium (RA) represents level
IV disease, according to the Mayo Classification system<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. In this case report, the surgical technique with
the concomitant use of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) for the resection of
advanced RCC were described, without the use of venovenous or cardiopulmonary
bypass.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>CASE REPORT</title><p>Two patients operated at our clinic in January 2018 were a 55-year-old female and
61-year-old male who were recently diagnosed with RCC, both with stage T4NxM0 (T4
tumor grossly extends into the vena cava above the diaphragm, Nx regional lymph
nodes cannot be assessed, and M0 indicates no distal metastasis), who were scheduled
for radical right nephrectomy with IVC thrombectomy. All patients were
preoperatively evaluated with routine blood analyses, chest X-ray, transthoracic
echocardiography (TTE) computerized tomography (CT) and contrast venacavography.
Preoperative CT and TTE revealed the tumor extension into the IVC up to the RA for
male patient and supradiaphragmatic portion of IVC in female patient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>

</p><p>The operation was performed by our team of vascular surgeons. Cardiac surgery team
was also assembled assigned to the care of the patient, because the original plan
was to do the sterno-laparotomy and partial veno-venous bypass. Following the
induction of general anesthesia, internal jugular central line was inserted. In
addition, a multiplane TEE probe was placed in the esophagus. Initial TEE
examination of the heart confirmed the normal cardiac structures and function
without a patent foramen ovale. TEE study was performed with emphasis on the hepatic
veins, IVC, right side of the heart, and pulmonary arteries (PAs). The tumor was
well visualized in the IVC extending proximal into the RA for male patient and
supradiaphragmatic portion of IVC in female patient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>
<fig id="f2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Echocardiogram in female patient with IVC tumor and supradiaphragmatic

</p><p>Surgery proceeded with median laparotomy and right subcostal incision for female
patient and bilateral subcostal Chevron incision for male patient. Cardio surgical
team and cardiopulmonary bypass team were placed on standby. Liver was mobilized,
hepatic veins were exposed, and the IVC was isolated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). With a Kocher maneuver the infrarenal IVC was exposed.
Proximal clamp was placed at the suprahepatic portion of IVC and distally at
infrarenal part of IVC. Renal artery and vein were ligated and thereafter infrarenal
IVC was clamped and opened at the level of renal vein (right for female and left for
male patient). Under the surveillance of TEE, the right atrium thrombus immediately
retracted in the supradiaphragmatic part of IVC in male patient and in
infradiaphragmatic-suprahepatic portion of IVC in female patient, and, subsequently,
thrombectomy was done. After the extraction of the thrombus the nephrectomy was
done. On the control TEE there was no remnant thrombus in IVC nor the evidence of
distal embolization. The site of thrombectomy on IVC was reconstructed with direct
suture in both cases. Due to adhesions between spleen and the left kidney, the
spleen was injured in male patient and subsequent splenectomy was done. During the
operation the female patient bleed out 2500ml and the male 1500ml. One thousand ml
of autologous blood was returned with Cell saver for female patient and 600ml for
male patient. The intraoperative course was uneventful and the patient went to the
ICU in stable condition. The gross specimen was inspected and found no missing a
tissue fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>). Further
postoperative TEE revealed no tumor masses in right atrium or retrohepatic part of
IVC. Postoperative recovery was uneventful as the first follow-up visit after one
month for both patients. Pathohistology two weeks after the operation showed the
confirmation of renal cell carcinoma both Fuhrman grade III.</p><p>

</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Surgical resection remains treatment mainstay for RCC. The critical factor for
successful surgery is mainly management of the IVC, and the important goals are to
minimize bleeding and prevent embolism from the thrombus during surgery. Either
event often leads to fatal consequences. Over the years, several approaches have
been developed to aid in the safe removal of these tumors. The improvement in
surgical technique has often been due to the application of surgical principles from
different disciplines. Cardiopulmonary bypass, with or without deep hypothermic
circulatory arrest, is an example of using cardiac surgery tools in an oncologic
operation. However, novel surgical techniques borrowed from liver transplant surgery
have allowed for exposure and isolation of the IVC during tumor resection thereby
sparing the use of vascular bypass<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. The concept of
resorting to an entirely intra-abdominal approach without cardiopulmonary or
veno-venous bypass is the byproduct of this approach<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Whereas such techniques avoid the risks of
cardiovascular bypass (<italic>i.e</italic>., coagulation system disturbances,
longer operating times, systemic inflammatory response), the chance for hemodynamic
compromise is increased during vena cava exploration and venous return
interruption.</p><p>Eighty-five patients were operated because of RCC tumor with extension into the IVC
from 2007 to 2017 at the Clinic for Vascular and Endovascular Surgery. Out of those,
five patients had the level IV tumor extension of RCC tumor. All of these were
operated with the standard use of sterno-laparatomy approach. The clinical
perioperative data of the five patients are summarized in <xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. In all of them partial cavo/veno-venous bypass was
used. The duration of operative time, IVC clamping and amount of blood loss was
higher in patient treated with standard approch. Two of the patients died
intrahospitaly [one due to renal failure and another because of acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS)].</p><table-wrap id="t1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Clinical and perioperative data of all patients with level IV tumor treated

IVC can be resected while employing a series of clamps in succession on the IVC that
allow for minimal venous return interruption. Once the renal artery is ligated and
IVC clamped in infrarenal position and opened, the thrombi are quickly removed with
the help of Fogarty catheter or resected to a position in the IVC below the hepatic
veins. After the tumor thrombus removal and nephrectomy the liver inflow and outflow
is restored. This partially mitigates the hemodynamic disturbance of impaired lower
abdominal venous return. Using these techniques, both hemodynamic an ischemic
consequences are lessened but still require care from the anesthesiologist in the
form of invasive monitors including arterial line, high volume central line, use of
vasopressors, and TEE.</p><p>Another interesting momment was observed the renal artery ligation and clamping of
the infrarenal part of IVC. The thrombus subsequently retracted and allowed its safe
removal. This could be explained that the most thrombus are not adherent to IVC
wall, and also by the fact that the inflow to the RA is reduced allowing thrombus
not to bee pushed by "full blood flow". This maneuver "simplify" operation when the
proximal extent of tumor is near hepatic veins or right atrium<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>TEE has major effects on the decision-making process in surgical and anesthetic
management. TEE can also demonstrate the tumor mobility, whether it is fragile
and/or adherent to the IVC. A fragile tumor has a higher risk of pulmonary embolism,
and adherence of the tumor to the IVC wall may result in an incomplete resection of
the tumor or vascular injury when using an occlusion balloon catheter. TEE imaging
can determine whether it will be possible to bring the thrombus down with the
balloon or not, and also provide information about the precise location and size of
the balloon. Because TEE visualized a mobile and oscillating thrombus, we decided to
remove it by using an occlusion balloon catheter. We removed the thrombus
successfully by this simple technique with minimum hepatic mobilization for the
thrombectomy. It should be also monitored by the operators directly on the surgical
field. Intraoperative real-time TEE monitoring can be provided by anesthesiologists
without interruption of the surgical procedure, and we regard this as one of the
most important advantages of TEE monitoring. Most importantly, the real-time TEE
monitoring allowed us to perform this intervention safely. Fortunately, no evidence
of pulmonary embolism was found in our two cases. Nevertheless real-time TEE can
provide rapid recognition of massive pulmonary embolism. TEE can reveal the sudden
disappearance of the tumor head, presence of the thrombus in the pulmonary artery,
or any sign of right heart dysfunction. Intraoperative TEE is also useful in
anesthetic management to evaluate the left ventricular volume (LV) and function.
Massive bleeding and decreased venous return due to the IVC clamp can be immediately
treated with volume loading according to the LV volume assessed by TEE.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Our preliminary experience suggest that the advantages of intraoperative TEE,
including verification of the level of IVC involvement, confirmation of complete
removal of the IVC thrombus, and intervention using catheters to assist in
thrombectomy. This would help with earlier detection and management of
complications, which will probably contribute to a decrease in the morbidity and
mortality associated with the management of those high-risk patients.</p><table-wrap id="t3" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="5%" span="1"/><col width="95%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PZ</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Study conception and design; acquisition of data;

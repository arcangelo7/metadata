increase the success rate of surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation.
Ganglionated plexi ablation requires previous detection. We aimed to assess
determinants of successful ganglionated plexi detection and to correlate
range of ganglionated plexi ablation with risk of early atrial fibrillation
recurrence.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The study involved 34 consecutive patients referred for surgical coronary
revascularization with concomitant atrial fibrillation ablation.
Ganglionated plexi detection was done by inducing vagal reflexes in the area
of the pulmonary veins and left atrial fat pads.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Detection of GP was successful in 85% of the patients. There was no
difference in preoperative characteristics nor in atrial fibrillation type
between patients in whom ganglionated plexi detection was successful and
others. The number of detected ganglionated plexi correlated significantly
only with preoperative resting heart rate. Significant negative correlation
was found in patients with preoperative heart rate&#x0003e;75 beat/min in terms
of total number of detected ganglionated plexi (<italic>P</italic>=0.04).
Average number of detected ganglionated plexi was significantly higher in
patients with in-hospital atrial fibrillation recurrence requiring
electrical cardioversion (3.8&#x000b1;3) in comparison to rest of the study
population (2&#x000b1;1.3; <italic>P</italic>=0.02). In patients in whom 4 or
more ganglionated plexi were detected, significantly increased risk of
in-hospital atrial fibrillation recurrence was observed (OR 15; 95% CI

percentage of patients. Preoperative heart rate significantly influenced
positive ganglionated plexi detection and number of ablated ganglia. Higher

undergoing cardiac surgery<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.
Adjunct ablation of cardiac autonomic ganglionated plexi (GP) may additionally
reduce AF recurrence. However, there is no clear data on its effectiveness, though
this technique was introduced a decade ago<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. The only GP ablation surgical technique introduced to
cardiac surgery is based on previous epicardial detection by inducing vagal reflex
with rapid stimulation. The stimulation of GP results in rapid acetylcholine
secretion and subsequently elicited vagal reflex (transient bradycardia, conduction
block)<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. Therefore, only
detected GP are ablated in that technique.</p><p>Anatomical studies showed that most GP are located within the epicardial fat pads
covering the entire antrum of the pulmonary veins (PVs) and the interatrial groove.
There is no data showing absence of GP in certain individuals<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. The success rate of detection and
the number of detected GP vary in the studies published thus far, and even more
limited data is available on the predictors of successful GP detection during
surgical ablation of AF<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. The primary aim of this study was
to analyze the preoperative factors corresponding to successful GP detection and the
number of detected GP in patients undergoing AF ablation concomitantly to surgical
coronary revascularization. The secondary aim was to search for a correlation
between GP detection and early recurrence of AF.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Study Population</title><p>The study involved 34 consecutive patients with persistent and long-standing
persistent AF and coronary artery disease referred for surgical
revascularization with concomitant left atrial ablation and left atrial
appendage epicardial occlusion. No inclusion or exclusion criteria were
introduced for this study since all patients with AF referred to surgical
revascularization are qualified for off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting
with concomitant left atrial ablation and left atrial appendage occlusion in our
center. All patients had a high stroke risk according to the CHA2DS2-VASc score
(mean score of 3.8&#x000b1;1.6) as well as an increased risk of bleeding on oral
anticoagulants, with an average HAS-BLED score of 3.1&#x000b1;1.3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). The study protocol was approved
by the Institutional Ethics Committee and all patients signed informed consent

transverse and oblique pericardial sinuses were dissected for full visualization
of the PVs' ostia and to allow for the placement of the bipolar radiofrequency
ablation device. Bilateral epicardial mapping of the PVs, left atrial antrum,
left atrial appendage, and the free wall of the right atrium was done using the
MAPS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> probe (Medtronic Inc., MN, USA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). Then, the first attempt at GP
detection was accomplished with rapid stimulation (800 beats/min) to induce
vagal reflex in the area of the PVs and left atrial fat pads. The sequence in
which rapid stimulation was applied is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>. The pacing output started at 5 V. If detection was
unsuccessful, pacing output was increased to 7 V and, finally, to 10 V. Vagal
reflex (signifying GP detection) was defined as a minimum 25% reduction in heart
rate or the occurrence of an atrio-ventricular conduction block. All planned
mapping areas were checked in every patient. Detected GP were epicardially
ablated using the same probe to apply radiofrequency energy (25 W). The ablated
area was then checked with rapid stimulation for persistent vagal reflex
occurrence. The PV isolation procedure was performed using a radiofrequency
bipolar device (Cardioblate<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Medtronic Inc., MN, USA). Each
ablation sequence consisted of four applications to each pair of PVs, followed
by probe repositioning and another four applications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). After each ablation sequence, mapping of PVs was
carried out to check for an entrance block. This ablation sequence was repeated
until no signal was detected over the PVs. Then, the Marshall fold was
dissected. Patients who remained in AF were then electrically converted to sinus
rhythm. The presence of an exit conduction block was assessed by PVs stimulation
with a 10 V output, at a rate of 120 per minute. Next, arterial and venous
grafts were harvested and the patients were heparinized with 300 units of
unfractionated heparin (UFH) per kilogram. Off-pump coronary artery bypass
grafting was performed. The left atrial appendage was epicardially occluded
using either the AtriClip<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Atricure, Dayton, OH, USA) or the
Tiger Paw System II<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Maquet). Completeness of left atrial
appendage (LAA) occlusion was ascertained through transoesophageal
echocardiography. Finally, protamine was given and the chest was closed in a
standard fashion.</p><p><fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Sequence for applying rapid stimulation to detect GP.</p><p>IVC=inferior vena cava; LA=left atrium; LAA=left atrial appendage;

(daily dose of 600 mg IV), continued for 48 hours, and then given as an oral
dose of 200 mg once daily until hospital discharge. Starting on the
1<sup>st</sup> postoperative day, all patients received bisoprolol at a
daily dose of 5 mg or 7.5 mg, depending on postoperative heart rate. Electric
cardioversion was performed in patients with AF recurrence, if the arrhythmia
was not self-terminating within 24 hours of onset, despite a potassium level of
&#x0003e; 4.5 mmol/l. All patients were discharged on oral amiodarone (200 mg daily
for 3 months).</p><p>Early effectiveness of this ablation procedure was assessed using the composite
end-point, which consisted of a need for electrical cardioversion due to
in-hospital AF recurrence, the presence of AF at hospital discharge, and after 3
months. At 3 months follow up, 24-hours Holter electrocardiography study was
done. AF recurrence was determined if AF episode longer than 30 seconds was
recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistica 12<sup>TM</sup> program
(StatSoft<sup>TM</sup>, Inc. 2012). The Shapiro-Wilk W test was used in
testing for normality. If the W statistic was significant, then the hypothesis
that the respective distribution is normal was rejected. Normally distributed
continuous variables are expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD).
Nonparametric and parametric data correlations were evaluated with either the
Spearman rank-test or the Pearson test. Comparisons of groups were performed
using the Student's t-test for normally distributed continuous variables, and
the Mann-Whitney test for non-normally distributed continuous variables.
Differences were considered significant at <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05. Logistic
regression analysis was performed to identify the risk factors associated with
arrhythmia recurrence. The results are expressed as odds ratio (OR), with a 95%
confidence interval (95% CI).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Successful GP Detection</title><p>Detection of GP was successful in 85% of the patients (29 patients). In 15% of

was 66.8 (range: 49-88 beats/min.). All patients were on beta-blocker up to the

bisoprolol (5mg per day) and metoprolol (50 mg per day). Type and dose of
beta-blocker was not changed at admission to the hospital. Type or dose of
beta-blocker used preoperatively did not correspond with preoperative HR.
According to anamnesis, all patients were on maximal dosage tolerated by them in
terms of atrial blood pressure. Moreover, there was no statistically significant

facilitation of premature atrial depolarization, shortening of the effective
refractory period and an increased refractoriness heterogeneity of the atrial
myocardium and the PVs<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>. Numerous studies have indicated
that AF triggers and drivers (rotors, multiple wavelets) located in the PVs and
posterior left atrial wall are generated by the ANS<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>. GP are
formed from epicardial extensions of mediastinal nerves entering the heart. The
highest density of cardiac GP is found in the fat pads surrounding the PV's entrance
to the left atrium<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. Those
regions are the targets for GP detection and ablation during both surgical and
transcatheter procedures.</p><p>Surgical GP ablation is a technique which is being applied as an adjunct strategy to
the standard atrial fibrillation ablation procedure (MAZE III or PV isolation).
Surgical GP ablation has been added to surgery due to promising data from
transcatheter ablation studies<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. Standard surgical GP ablation is
based on GP detection. Vagal reflex is induced with high frequency (800 bpm) low
voltage epicardial stimulation (5-10 V) of certain areas around the PVs ostia and
the left atrial antrum. Epicardial mapping usually consists of applying current to 9
to 12 areas on each side. High frequency stimulation over GP results in rapid
acetylcholine secretion. This signal is transmitted through atrial autonomic
pathways to the sinus and atrio-ventricular nodes, resulting in transient
bradycardia or an atrio-ventricular conduction block (via the vagal reflex). The
epicardial ablation probe is then focally applied over the heart segment whose
stimulation elicited such activity.</p><p>Several authors have reported different numbers of GP detected in different heart
segments using this technique. Mehall et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> detected 0 to 10 active GP. In their cohort, a mean of 5 GP
on the right side and 2.7 GP on the left side were ablated. The most common location
of GP was found to be over the right superior PV and the left superior PV - in the
area of the Marshall fold<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. Kondo
et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> reported an average
number of 2.2 GP detected on the right and 0.4 on the left side. In this study
population, GP detection was unsuccessful in 19% of the patients, and the most
common location of detected GP was the area at the right inferior PV and between the
right PVs.</p><p>It has been shown that the number and the location of detected left atrial GP is not
fully consistent with the underlying anatomy<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>. Therefore, the GP detected during surgical procedures
have been called "active ganglia". However, there is no proof that the undetectable
ganglia are not physiologically active in those patients. Moreover, none of the
anatomical studies have shown the absence of GP in areas where their detection was
not successful during surgical procedures. Those findings may reveal a shortcoming
of the detection technique. Thus far, there are no studies revealing the factors
leading to positive GP detection during cardiac surgical procedures. In our study,
the number of detected GP depended only on preoperative resting heart rate. A lower
heart rate might be due to higher parasympathetic activity and thus increase the
chance of a positive vagal reflex in those patients. Other factors (including age
and type of AF) did not play a significant role in the success of GP detection.</p><p>The study showed significant correlation between the number of GP detected and early
recurrence of AF after surgical ablation. Furthermore, we found that a higher number
of GP detected was related to a higher risk of AF recurrence. Additionally, patients
with a higher number of detected GP presented lower preoperative resting HR. These
findings may support the thesis that, in patients with positive detection of GP, the
density of ANS structures and concentration of neurotransmitter in left atrial fat
pads (acetylcholine) is high. This may explain the easier induction of vagal reflex
in that subgroup. However, undetected ganglia may secrete neurotransmitters
postoperatively, lowering the threshold of early postoperative AF. It has been shown
that postoperative AF after cardiac surgical procedures is related to ANS
activity<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>. Eventually,
lower preoperative HR may be a marker of parasympathetic predominance in this study
population.</p><p>There is no general consensus on the long-term efficacy of GP ablation during
surgical AF ablation procedures<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>. It is recommended as an additional strategy that might reduce
early and mid-term AF recurrence<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. However, the efficacy of surgical GP ablation may be
underestimated due to the flaws of the detection technique. Our finding that the
efficacy of GP detection was related only to preoperative HR may provide support for
the shortcomings of the detection technique. For this reason, any attempt at
evaluating the success of surgical GP ablation in decreasing AF recurrence is
limited by imperfect GP detection. Thus, we suppose that incomplete epicardial
denervation of the left atrium based on inadequate GP detection may limit the
potential effectiveness of surgical autonomic modulation.</p><p>The findings of this study have resulted in a modification of the surgical technique
used. We decided to perform total epicardial ablation of the left atrial fat pads
regardless of the results of GP detection. The effectiveness of this approach is
being evaluated in a prospective study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The number of detected GP correlates significantly with a lower preoperative heart
rate. The success of GP detection and the number of GP detected remains unrelated to
all other preoperative factors in patients undergoing surgical ablation of AF.
Higher number of detected GP is associated with increased risk of early recurrence
of AF after surgical ablation. The current GP detection technique based on vagal
reflex induction resulted in the omission of fifteen percent of the study patients
from left atrial autonomic denervation.</p><table-wrap id="t7" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="10%" span="1"/><col width="90%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GS</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Conception and study design; realization of operations;

Cancer was not mentioned. Participants reporting any of 10 cancer alarm symptoms (<italic>n</italic> = 915) and who had consented to contact (<italic>n</italic> = 482) formed the potential pool from which people were invited to an interview focusing on their symptom experiences.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Reasons for help seeking included symptom persistence, social influence, awareness/fear of a link with cancer, and &#x02018;just instinct&#x02019;. Perceiving the symptom as trivial or &#x02018;normal&#x02019; was a deterrent, as was stoicism, adopting self-management strategies, and fear of investigations. Negative attitudes to help seeking were common. Participants did not want to be seen as making a fuss, did not want to waste the doctor&#x02019;s time, and were sometimes not confident that the GP could help.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Decision making about cancer alarm symptoms was complex. Recognition of cancer risk almost always motivated help seeking (more so than the fear of cancer being a deterrent), assisted by recent public-awareness campaigns. As well as symptom persistence motivating help seeking, it could also have the reverse effect.

This is the first qualitative, community-based study to assess how people respond to cancer &#x02018;alarm&#x02019; symptoms outside of the cancer context. The results not only highlighted the importance of people&#x02019;s interpretations of symptoms, but also their sense that they had to limit their demands for GP advice, both to preserve their self-image and to avoid uncomfortable interactions with the GP if they were seen as time wasters. The findings highlight potential avenues to promote prompt help seeking.</p></sec></boxed-text><p>In total, 482 participants met the eligibility criteria.

However, the definition of &#x02018;persistent&#x02019; varied, with people referring to durations of days, weeks, months, or even years before contacting the GP:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;When it wasn&#x02019;t getting any better, I think I mentioned it to the GP, yeah, but it could have taken me 2 years to get to that point.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(P9, male, non-healing sore)</attrib></disp-quote></p></sec><sec><title>Instinct</title><p>There was evidence for the influence of instinct or &#x02018;gut feeling&#x02019; &#x02014; &#x02018;you just know&#x02019; (P31, male, persistent cough) &#x02014; when something was not right with the body and it was time to seek help. In these cases, the sense that something was not right was immediate and a decision was made to seek help. This was observed for &#x02018;obvious&#x02019; symptoms such as unexplained bleeding:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;But this slight bleeding from the bum was &#x02026; I think it was an instinctive thing. I just instinctively knew that something was not quite right.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(P39, female, unexplained rectal bleeding)</attrib></disp-quote>
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;You know when you just feel in your water that it isn&#x02019;t right, and that&#x02019;s how I felt.

Symptoms in this category were becoming more visible over time and this, in combination with sanctioning from peers, triggered help seeking:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;But then it progressed so that I was coughing during the day and then it even progressed more that it was actually waking me up during the night.

Several people mentioned that seeing a cancer-awareness campaign prompted them to seek help from their doctor. This was sometimes because the campaign alerted them to their symptom being related to cancer, and sometimes because it provided a &#x02018;nudge&#x02019; or endorsement that they should seek help for their symptom:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;Well, it&#x02019;s probably a bit longer than 3 months but I had irregular bowel movements. Occasionally, there were signs of blood and, at the time, there was a TV or a radio advertising campaign that if you have these sorts of symptoms you should go to the doctors. And that&#x02019;s really &#x02026; I was putting two and two together, that&#x02019;s why I went to the doctors.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(P32, male, unexplained rectal bleeding, persistent change in bowel habits)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>Despite framing the interviews within the context of general questions about health and not mentioning cancer, a number of people spontaneously mentioned fear that the symptom might be due to cancer as a trigger for help seeking:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;But always at the back of your mind you&#x02019;ve always got the fear of cancer, that&#x02019;s all really, just at the back of my mind I think it might be, well it&#x02019;s best to check just in case, sort of thing.

As P6 (male, persistent cough, unexplained throat lump, change in bowel habits) commented:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;It&#x02019;s like fear of the dark or fear of anything, really, fear of psychopaths, you know, it&#x02019;s just there.&#x02019;</p></disp-quote></p><p>Despite this reluctance to seek help, the fear that the symptom could be due to cancer was also a motivator to do so:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;Well, because my partner&#x02019;s ex-wife died as well, about 18 months after him, and she had a lot of the different symptoms &#x02014; reflux, bowel, whatever, and it turned out that she had cancer on the liver and in various other places. So if you are not of a medical background and you don&#x02019;t watch medical programmes, you are very ignorant and so that made me think &#x0201c;oh gosh, I should get that checked out&#x0201d;.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(P15, female, persistent difficulty swallowing, persistent change in bladder/bowel habits)</attrib></disp-quote></p></sec></sec><sec><title>Reasons for not seeking help</title><p>Five main themes emerged:

<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;You&#x02019;ve just got to get on with it.

One man reported a recent worsening in bowel symptoms and, although he had previously been to the doctor about it, he had not informed the GP that it had been getting worse over the past 3 months, deciding instead to manage it himself:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;When I&#x02019;m very tired, I literally have to let it go and not get up. So that&#x02019;s what I do and that really helps me.

However, this seemed to be more to do with self-identity than rationing their access to health care: people wanted to identify themselves as someone who used health care only when it was absolutely necessary.

Adults who had experienced a range of cancer &#x02018;alarm&#x02019; symptoms were interviewed; some had sought help for their symptoms and some had not. Symptom persistence, recognition that the symptom could be due to cancer, and social influence all facilitated help seeking. People held negative attitudes to help seeking and this resulted in them adopting alternative strategies to seek medical advice.</p><p>People thought they could manage the symptom themselves, which in some cases may be the appropriate response, because symptoms will often be benign and self-limiting. However, there was evidence of stoicism even in the case of debilitating symptoms. One potential explanation for high symptom tolerance relates to the dual nature of persistence: although it could motivate help seeking, it also resulted in the symptom becoming &#x02018;normal&#x02019;. Interpretations in the latter category led people to self-manage, which reduced the likelihood of help seeking. Interestingly, what people meant by &#x02018;persistent&#x02019; varied enormously, with some people talking in units of days/weeks and others in years.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>These findings build on the body of research carried out with patients who have cancer and, by using a community sample with recent experience of alarm symptoms, avoids the potential bias introduced by having already had a cancer diagnosis. The group of adults interviewed was diverse in terms of education level and sex.</p><p>The timeframe for symptom experience was shorter (past 3 months) than for many patient studies, which should improve recall. In addition, the issue of actions being affected by people&#x02019;s expectations about what they &#x02018;should&#x02019; do with potential cancer symptoms<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> was avoided by not mentioning cancer.</p><p>Qualitative studies are limited in their generalisability; however, compared with quantitative studies, they can provide richer insights. Interviews necessarily took place at one time-point in the symptom appraisal &#x02018;journey&#x02019;. Ideally, longitudinal studies would follow-up people to see how help-seeking experiences develop over time. Our sample was drawn from the London setting, which limits generalisability to other geographical regions, but is pertinent because London has 1-year survival rates that are among the lowest in England.<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>The sample size was a limitation, particularly covering such a diverse range of symptoms. Symptom-specific studies may capture demographic differences that were not apparent here.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with existing literature</title><p>Symptom persistence was often given as the reason for seeking help, consistent with the &#x02018;duration rule&#x02019; outlined in the Model of Pathways to Treatment.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> This was partly because it appeared to indicate a higher level of seriousness, but the persistence effect was often in combination with the symptom being unusual, unexpected, or painful; consistent with the idea that only bothersome and personally relevant symptoms are seen as warranting medical attention.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>As observed in other studies, social influence played a role, with several people saying they only consulted the GP on advice from others, most often a spouse or partner; this is consistent with the idea that the social context is important in sanctioning help seeking.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Despite the term &#x02018;cancer&#x02019; not being raised by the interviewer, and participants using terms that avoided saying the word cancer (for example, &#x02018;<italic>the bogeyman</italic>&#x02019;), recognition that the symptom may be due to cancer was clearly a strong motivator for help seeking, which is consistent with clinical studies.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>More reasons were given for not seeking help than for help seeking, indicating a range of different barriers. In a significant number of cases, the symptom had not been recognised as serious, particularly when it was painless or intermittent. This echoes findings from a systematic review of patient-related factors in delayed presentation,<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and from patients with pancreatic cancer, where intermittent symptoms were often ignored because they were not considered serious enough to see a doctor.<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>Symptom seriousness was also downplayed when it was attributed to the ageing process rather than illness (termed the &#x02018;age heuristic&#x02019;).<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> This is problematic given that the risk of cancer increases with age. Awareness of age-related cancer risk in the UK is lower than other countries,<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> but ongoing campaigns to raise awareness of age as a risk factor may help mitigate age attributions.<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> It should be recognised that &#x02018;normalising&#x02019; is not unique to cancer symptoms; for example, one study found that people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds were more likely to normalise chest pain because they had greater exposure to ill health generally.<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>Fear of cancer sometimes deterred people from seeking help, although this occurred less often than it motivated them. However, it is possible that participants found it easier to discuss fear of cancer after they had already consulted and been reassured; before consultation, fear could be harder to acknowledge. Further research could explore the role of fear in more detail to help understand when it promotes versus deters early presentation.</p><p>Negative attitudes towards interactions with the GP were widespread. People were worried about wasting the doctor&#x02019;s time and reported experiencing difficulty making appointments, lack of continuity of care (seeing different doctors on different visits), and lack of confidence in the doctor; all of these findings are consistent with previous findings.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>No participant referred to the positive role for the GP in allaying fears or resolving problems; GPs were only mentioned as barriers.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>A finding that has not yet emerged from the literature on risk factors for delayed presentation of symptomatic cancer was that people were not always able to describe their decision-making process, and sometimes referred to an &#x02018;instinct&#x02019; about the symptom. To date, people have been asked to describe their pathway to diagnosis retrospectively, which may award rationality to decisions that were made automatically.

Ongoing public health efforts to improve early presentation by raising public awareness of symptoms were helping, but addressing other barriers could increase the potential gain.</p></sec></sec></body><back><notes><sec><title>Funding</title><p>The study was funded by a Cancer Research UK post-doctoral fellowship grant awarded to Katriina Whitaker (reference number: C33872/A13216).</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical approval</title><p>The study was approved by London Bridge NHS Research Ethics Committee (REC reference: 11/LO/1970).</p></sec><sec><title>Provenance</title><p>Freely submitted; externally peer reviewed.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors have declared no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Discuss this article</title><p>Contribute and read comments about this article: <bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="bjgp.org/letters">bjgp.org/letters</ext-link></bold></p></sec></notes><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="b1"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Berrino</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>De Angelis</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Sant</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Survival for eight major cancers and all cancers combined for European adults diagnosed in 1995&#x02013;99: results of the EUROCARE-4 study</article-title><source>Lancet Oncol</source><year>2007</year><volume>8</volume><issue>9</issue><fpage>773</fpage><lpage>783</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17714991</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2"><label>2.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Coleman</surname><given-names>MP</given-names></name><name><surname>Forman</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Bryant</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Cancer survival in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and the UK, 1995&#x02013;2007 (the International Cancer Benchmarking Partnership): an analysis of population-based cancer registry data</article-title><source>Lancet</source><year>2011</year><volume>377</volume><issue>9760</issue><fpage>127</fpage><lpage>138</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21183212</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b3"><label>3.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Thomson</surname><given-names>CS</given-names></name><name><surname>Forman</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Cancer survival in England and the influence of early diagnosis: what can we learn from recent EUROCARE results?</article-title><source>Br J Cancer</source><year>2009</year><volume>101</volume><issue>suppl 2</issue><fpage>S102</fpage><lpage>S109</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19956153</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b4"><label>4.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Vedsted</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Olesen</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Are the serious problems in cancer survival partly rooted in gatekeeper principles?

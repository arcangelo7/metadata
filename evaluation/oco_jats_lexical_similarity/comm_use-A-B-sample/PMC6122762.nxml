Its surgical corrections may haemodinamically correct a disease, but the
incisions may create scars that will originate ventricular arrhythmias. Even
though life threatening arrhythmias are not common, some patients present
unstable ventricular tachycardia (VT) of ectopic ventricular beats triggering
heart failure and symptoms. We describe the treatment of a 16-years-old woman
with late ToF repair and drug refractory Implantable cardioverter defibrillator
(ICD) shocks. The patient underwent successful ablation of VT using X-ray and
anatomic landmarks without the use of electroanatomical mapping. We were able to
reduce drugs after one month of ablation and improve quality of life and
symptoms. In this paper we describe the indications and perform a brief review
of the key points for successful radiofrequency catheter ablation of VT in ToF
patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Arrhythmias, Cardiac</kwd><kwd>Tetralogy of Fallot</kwd><kwd>Heart Defects, Congenital</kwd><kwd>Catheter Ablation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><table-wrap id="t1" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="10%" span="1"/><col width="90%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" style="background-color:#e6e7e8" rowspan="1">Abbreviations,

great spectrum of severity and anatomy. The surgical corrections are mostly guided
by severity of pulmonary flow restriction and right ventricle (RV) hemodynamic
compromise. Ventricular arrhythmias are common, even though clinically relevant
ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a rare feature, and it is usually related to ominous
prognosis. Most ventricular arrhythmias are a marker of prosthesis dysfunction or
need for another open heart procedure. In some cases, though, VT can arise from scar
related reentry circuits created by the previous surgical procedures. Amiodarone and
beta-blockers can diminish arrhythmia burden, but are often less than effective.
Ablation using electroanatomical mapping has been widely described by previous
authors and the same authors have described the four main VT circuits that comprise
most of the ventricular arrhythmias in this population. Even though
electroanatomical (EA) mapping is available in many countries, some developing
hospitals are not entitled to this technology. In this report we describe one
alternative approach of VT ablation in late ToF repair using X-ray and anatomical
landmarks, without aid of EA mapping.</p></sec><sec><title>CASE REPORT</title><p>We present the case of a 16-year-old ToF patient, born in 2000. On a ventricular
septal defect of 7.5 mm, the first surgical procedure was performed in 2001
(pulmonary commissurotomy + closure of ventricular septal defect +
infundibulectomy), the second procedure in 2008 (homograft) and the third procedure
was performed in 2009 due to homograft dysfunction, calcification and regurgitation
[implantation of pulmonary valve bioprosthesis number 25 + and surgical
ablation of ventricular ectopic beats arising from right ventricular outflow tract
(RVOT), aiming for ventricular ectopy reduction using surgical mapping and
electrocautery ablation]. The patient presented severe scoliosis, but was
otherwise physically active.</p><p>When the patient was 14 years old she presented with palpitations and dizziness. Rest
electrocardiography (EKG) showed a sinus rhythm of 67 bpm and right bundle branch
block. Holter recordings at that time recorded 295 ventricular tachycardias, the
longest with 107 beats (129 bpm) and the fastest lasting with 15 beats (136
bpm).</p><p>A single chamber implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) was implanted in
November of 2015, and amiodarone and metoprolol were initiated and the dosage
uptitrated to amiodarone 600 mg/day, metoprolol 200 mg/day and phenytoin 200 mg/day.
Oral magnesium was added to the treatment regimen without adequate response.</p><p>The patient presented 155 new VT episodes since the implant, 18 of which elicited
therapy (total of 23 shocks). Last admission for appropriate shock was in October
2016, when ablation attempt was programmed. Echocardiogram at the time referred to
moderate RV enlargement (evaluated in a subjective two-observer analysis including
at least one CHD specialist, as protocol in our institution) with normal RV and left
ventricular ejection fraction, ventricular patch and pulmonary prosthesis with
normal function (pulmonary arterial pressure of 40 mmHg) and mild tricuspid
regurgitation. Between shocks, the patient showed mild heart failure symptoms
(fatigue during moderate activities).</p><p>Ablation was performed under general anesthesia, fluoroscopy (GE 9900, General
Electrics, USA), and Tecnologia Eletronica Brasileira (TEB) recording systems for
electrical signal acquisition and stimulation. The pulmonary valve was identified
using a pig tail 5F catheter and iodine contrast to locate the pulmonary prosthesis.
A 20-pole catheter was located from septal wall (proximal end), along the anterior
portion of the RVOT, to the RV free wall (distal end). The disposition of the
catheters was diagramed as showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure
1</xref>.</p><p>

isthmus number 4 (between septal tricuspid valve and VSD patch. Ablation
catheter - white line - on isthmus number 3 (between pulmonary valve and
VSD patch), Quadripolar catheter - green line - on isthmus number 1
(between infundibulectomy and lateral tricuspid valve). There was no
intention in mapping possible isthmus number 2 because the first surgery
was performed along the pulmonary valve, thus surgically connecting the
infundibulectomy patch with the pulmonary artery and then replacing it
for the pulmonary prosthesis.</p><p>PV = pulmonary valve; RVOT = Right ventricular outflow tract; TV =
tricuspid valve; VSD = ventricular septal defect.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-33-04-0418-g01"/></fig>
</p><p>Using that catheter, we were able to identify the landmarks that would be used to
perform the ablation lines. The septal patch and the RVOT patch were identified by
the low voltage areas (and non-capture using high output pacing), meaning absence of
viable muscle. Before ablation, catheters were positioned on each of the four most
frequent isthmus. Since the first surgery connected the RVOT patch and the pulmonary
valve, and no electrical activity was found in isthmus 2, we assumed the surgical
procedures performed earlier deemed mapping of this area unnecessary. Electrical
programmed stimulation was performed using up to three extra stimuli and ventricular
burst, which started an unstable VT. The VT was interrupted with external electrical
cardioversion. Pacing was performed along isthmus 1, 3 and 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). Mid-diastolic potentials were found during VT on
isthmus 3. Pacing from that site was also similar to the induced VT.</p><p>
<fig id="f2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>During EPS with S1 600 ms and S2 340 ms unstable VT was repeatedly
induced and the cycle length was equal to the ICD recordings. The
mid-diastolic EGM from the ablation catheter positioned between the VSDC
and the pulmonary prosthesis was considered significant and pacing from
that site with 500 ms cycle length was similar to the induced VT (site
three). Previously, ablation pace mapping from the ablation sites were
tried for mapping most probable isthmus. We can see pacing from isthmus
3 (between VSD patch and pulmonary valve), isthmus 4 (between VSD patch
and tricuspid valve) and isthmus 1 (between RVOT patch and tricuspid
valve). Isthmus 2 was not considered for ablation since the scar of the
first surgery connected the RVOT and the pulmonary artery and no local
EGM was found in this area to be treated.</p><p>PV = pulmonary valve; RVOT = Right ventricular outflow tract; TV =

</p><p>Ablation was performed from the bioprosthesis (identified using a pig tail catheter
and pulmonary angiogram, as well as absence of electrical activity) to the VSDC
(also, absence of electrical activity). We decided to create an ablation line
between the pulmonary prosthesis and the VSDC using an 8 mm tip catheter and 70W in
60 degrees Celsius for 90 seconds in each site. The 20-pole deflectable was
positioned along the line, and ventricular double potentials or electrical
non-capture along the line were sought as interruption criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). A roving 20-pole deflectable catheter
was used to record the absence of electrical activity after ablation and to allow
the operator to create an imaginary line of ablation along the catheter. After
ablation pacing from one side, the ablation was performed in order to register the
absence of electrical signal along the line and increased time from stimulus to
local EGM from one side of the line to another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure
4</xref>). That allowed us to infer blockage between the two anatomical
landmarks.</p><p>

</p><p>After successful ablation of this isthmus we performed three additional lines using a
similar method on the three remaining isthmus. After ablation, new attempts to
induce the VT, with or without drug elicitation were unsuccessful (new protocol of
S1 450 ms, S2 300 ms, S3 220 ms and S4 200 ms and ventricular burst using a 220 ms
cycle in the right ventricular apex and RVOT).</p><p>The patient was on amiodarone 200 mg with metoprolol 100 mg a day for twelve months
and no VT episode, sustained or not, was observed on ICD or Holter recordings. The
patient showed improvement of heart failure symptoms. The drug reduction was 66% for
amiodarone, 50% for metoprolol and interruption of phenytoin and magnesium.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>As of 2001, there were estimated to be 800,000 adults living with CHD in the United
States alone<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. The
Brazilian database suggests an incidence of close to 25,000 newborns with CHD in
2010, and among those 973 were born with the diagnosis of ToF<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. In a recent survey
published in Brazilian Journal of Cardiovascular Surgery, close to 1.6% of the heart
surgeries performed in Brazil are on congenital heart patients<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. ToF is one of the most
frequent surgically corrected CHD present in our country, as it afflicts nearly 10%
of all CHD patients. Even though the prognosis of ToF patients has improved, late
ventricular arrhythmias remain a risk during the long term. VT can be found in near
11.9% of the cases, and sudden cardiac death takes a toll in up to 8.3% of patients
after 35 years of follow up<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>First line therapy for asymptomatic patients with ToF and non-sustained ventricular
arrhythmias remain beta blockers, especially in those with preserved ventricular
function<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.
Patients with syncope and/or sustained VT require invasive evaluation, as well as
assessment of ventricular function and prosthesis dysfunction. In the event of need
for another surgical procedure, invasive electrical programmed stimulation can guide
surgical ablation and identify the culprit isthmus<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In patients who do not need further surgical procedure, catheter ablation should be
considered an option. The indications of ICD in this set of patients remain despite
the procedure, and in patients who are already ICD recipients, ablation could be a
reasonable alternative to high dosage of amiodarone for long periods (most patients
are in their mid 30s and should have a reasonable survival). As for patients in
higher risk of sudden cardiac death that are candidates for another cardiac surgery,
they should be carefully evaluated for indications of ICD, since the correction of
hemodynamic problems alone does not correct arrhythmias in the long
run<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In 2007, Zeppenfeld et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> published a pivotal paper that evaluated electroanatomic
mapping of 11 patients with sustained VT and late surgically corrected ToF. The
paper evolved to the largest series of VT ablation of 74 patients with surgically
corrected ToF (authored by Kapel et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>, in 2017). The series described four locations of VT
circuits and related them to anatomical landmarks. The most usual circuit was
related to one of the four isthmus in 37 of the 41 patients in which VT was induced.
Out of 71 patients, only 2 presented VT unrelated to one of the four isthmus.</p><p>The most frequent isthmus (27 VTs) was present between the pulmonary valve/prosthesis
and the VSDC (Isthmus 3), the second (10 VTs) was between the tricuspid valve and
the RVOT incision/patch (Isthmus 1), then (2 VT) present between the pulmonary
valve/prosthesis and the RVOT incision/patch (Isthmus 2) and the last VT between the
VSDC and the tricuspid valve (Isthmus 4). Notably, the narrowest isthmus presented
the slowest electrical conduction and the most probable VT circuit. VT ablation was
performed in slow conducting isthmus in 63 patients (out of 74) and they all
remained uneventful after a medium follow up of 55 months<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The lack of EA mapping in public health in Brazil is one of the major setbacks for
electrophysiology. Patients with structural heart disease and the need for
interventional procedures are often subject to toxic antiarrhythmic drug dosage and
scarcely studied drug combinations<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. ICD batteries are frequently depleted earlier than
expected due to shocks that might be avoided, causing intense emotional and physical
extenuation. Cases like the one reported are referred to heart transplant more
frequently than to VT ablation in most centers.</p><p>We present a successful approach for VT ablation in this setting of structural heart
disease without EA mapping. The possibility of a successful ablation was enhanced by
knowledge of the surgical procedure performed and lengthy discussion with the
cardiac surgeons and chat reviews. Since the anatomical landmarks are electrically
non-excitable tissue (<italic>i.e.</italic> bovine pericardial patch and tricuspid
valve), pacing on the edge of the landmark was used to identify the end of the
myocardium and the beginning of the surgical repair. Adequate positioning of
catheters on each isthmus prior to VT induction allowed us to identify mid-diastolic
potentials and probable isthmus, and an increased probability was observed after
contrasting the 12-lead EKG obtained during pacing from that site and the 12-lead of
the induced VT.</p><p>The use of long multipolar catheters to guide the ablation line was extremely
helpful, both as a form of guiding the ablation catheter and as a way of identifying
the abolition of EGM along this same line.</p><p>The authors believe that this step by step procedure will help electrophysiologists
enhance VT control in ToF patients when substrate ablation using EA mapping is not
an option.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>VT ablation in patients with ToF is feasible and should be considered when there is
no hemodynamic anatomical compromise or prosthetic failure. Ablation is most of the
times related to four critical isthmus, and even though EA mapping is a potentially
beneficial instrument for increasing ablation efficacy, conventional mapping and
ablation should be performed and can elicit benefits in reducing drugs and ICD
therapies.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="5%" span="1"/><col width="95%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BPV</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Substantial contributions to the

With more than 300 million consultations taking place each year,<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> general practice provides an ideal platform from which to deliver individual-level interventions. It is already the largest site of delivery for the NHS Health Check programme and brief interventions based in general practice have been shown to reduce smoking<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and alcohol consumption,<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> as well as promoting physical activity <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and weight loss.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> With the exception of smoking cessation, however, almost all of these interventions focus on cardiovascular disease (CVD); there is little discussion about cancer.</p><p>A number of risk tools are now available that predict an individual&#x02019;s future risk of cancer. These include the Harvard Risk Tool,<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> QCancer,<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and large numbers of disease-specific tools (for example, the Gail risk model for breast cancer).<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Each tool uses risk factors, such as age, sex, family history of cancer, and medical history, alongside lifestyle factors to estimate an individual&#x02019;s risk of developing cancer over a defined time period, often 10 years.</p><p>A number of theories of health behaviour change suggest that risk perception may be an important factor associated with preventive behaviours.<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Being able to estimate and communicate individual risk, and demonstrate the impact of lifestyle change on future risk of cancer, therefore, has the potential to motivate behaviour change. A recent systematic review of cancer risk assessment tools in primary care suggests their use has potentially beneficial effects on the accuracy of patient risk perception and knowledge, intentions to have cancer screening, and changes in diet and physical activity, without causing an increase in cancer-specific anxiety.<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>Unlike similar risk tools for other conditions (such as QRisk2,<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Predict CVD,<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> the Framingham risk score for CVD,<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> the FRAX fracture risk assessment tool,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and QFracture),<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> these tools for cancer are not integrated into primary care computer systems or routinely used in practice.

In all groups, participants were first asked how people in their practice currently get information about their future risk of disease and lifestyle advice in general, and about cancer specifically.

Most of this work was carried out by nurses via the NHS Health Check programme or in dedicated appointments initiated by patients or through GP referrals. It was unusual for GPs to have specific time for health promotion and they tended to fit it in during other appointments. Most of the advice given during those consultations was focused on CVD; although GPs recognised that many of the risk factors overlap with those for cancer, cancer was only raised opportunistically &#x02014; and mostly in relation to smoking and lung cancer:
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;I don&#x02019;t think</italic> &#x02026; <italic>I specifically address cancer risk in those consultations, it&#x02019;s more opportunistic for me so like</italic> &#x02026; <italic>if you do a smear</italic> [test]<italic>, that kind of cancer risk crops up. But just general cancer risk, I think if I&#x02019;m talking about risk with a patient it&#x02019;s generally cardiovascular risk. I don&#x02019;t think at the moment I really mention cancer unless it&#x02019;s linked to smoking.&#x02019;</italic></p><attrib>(GP 5, focus group 4, 5&#x02013;10 years)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>Those involved in commissioning were also not aware of any current services targeting cancer prevention:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;<italic>I don&#x02019;t think we do many or if any, you know, sort of cancer risk assessments or planning for cancer in that sense</italic>.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(GP commissioner 2, focus group 5, 5&#x02013;10 years)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>In addition, although all participants were familiar with, and regularly used, risk assessment tools for CVD, none was aware of any similar tools for cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>The power of the word &#x02018;cancer&#x02019;</title><p>Several participants in each group mentioned the power of the word &#x02018;cancer&#x02019;, and there was a general view that people may make more lifestyle changes in response to risk of cancer than to risk of CVD because they perceive cancer to be more serious, or are more afraid of it:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;I think this might be quite a positive in terms of changing their lifestyle because I think someone is more likely to change their lifestyle when presented with a cancer risk than when presented with a heart attack or a stroke risk, because I think heart attack and a stroke most people recover, you know, but cancer I think people think it&#x02019;s a lot more serious.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(GP 4, focus group 4, &#x0003e;10 years)</attrib></disp-quote>
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;I think certainly some people</italic> [would make lifestyle changes]<italic>, purely out of the fact that some people are so fearful of the word &#x02018;cancer&#x02019;, as soon as you mention it they probably want to do something. If you talk about the risk of getting dementia or the risk of getting heart disease in the future it doesn&#x02019;t seem to strike them as much, but as soon as you mention the C word, they probably act a lot more, I think.&#x02019;</italic></p><attrib>(GP trainee 2, focus group 3, in training)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>This was particularly thought to be the case for younger people, for whom cancer was felt to be more relevant than CVD:
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;I think cancer&#x02019;s more, especially in the young</italic> &#x02026; <italic>it&#x02019;s something that they can relate to because they may know of someone with cancer, whereas cardiovascular disease I think they see as something</italic> [that] <italic>happens to older people and not something they need to worry about right now.&#x02019;</italic></p><attrib>(GP 2, focus group 1, &#x0003c;5 years)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>There was acknowledgement, however, of the challenges of trying to get people to change their behaviour; one participant likened it to &#x02018;<italic>bang</italic>[ing] <italic>our heads against brick walls</italic>&#x02019; (GP trainee 2, Focus group 3, in training). The potential for discussions about cancer risk to be demotivating if patients perceived the risk to be high, and therefore unchangeable, and the possibility of generating health anxiety and reinforcing anxiety in those already concerned about their health were also raised across the focus groups:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;&#x02026; you want to make sure that the information you&#x02019;re giving people is not only understandable but that it doesn&#x02019;t completely alter them in a way that&#x02019;s unhelpful, because you don&#x02019;t want to induce health anxiety because that&#x02019;s, you know, that doesn&#x02019;t help us or them mostly.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(GP trainee 3, focus group 3, in training)</attrib></disp-quote>
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;It</italic> [the risk estimate] <italic>may be quite high and a bit demotivating if you think &#x0201c;well no matter what I do, you know, I&#x02019;m going to get cancer&#x0201d;, which might be what some people take away from this.&#x02019;</italic></p><attrib>(GP 4, focus group 4, &#x0003e;10 years)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>Several individuals, however, discussed how cardiovascular risk assessment and faecal occult blood testing had generated anxiety when they were first introduced, but people &#x02018;<italic>just expect it now</italic>&#x02019; (student nurse 1, focus group 1, in training). Normalising cancer risk by making it part of routine care was, therefore, seen as an important way to reduce the potential for generating anxiety:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;So if it was more of a routine type, you know, check, but for the younger age group or whatever, then that would normalise it, wouldn&#x02019;t it? So perhaps the anxiety wouldn&#x02019;t be as great.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Nurse 1, focus group 1, &#x0003e;10 years)</attrib></disp-quote>
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;But it&#x02019;s all about what people expect at the moment and what we&#x02019;re doing so maybe not now, but maybe in 5 years, everyone will expect a letter about their cancer risk when they turn 30, like they expect their smear</italic> [test] <italic>letter.

<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;I think a generic cancer message is less likely to hit home, or it&#x02019;s less likely to influence an individual &#x02026; I think people need to see the relevance to them &#x02026; so personalising it makes it a bit more likely that they will absorb the information and do something about it.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(GP 7, focus group 2, &#x0003e;10 years)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>Almost all also thought the risk should be presented as a numerical estimate. They felt that providing numbers makes the assessment <italic>&#x02018;a more powerful tool</italic>&#x02019; (GP trainee 1, focus group 3, in training), with patients feeling <italic>&#x02018;it&#x02019;s more personalised or applicable to them</italic>&#x02019; (GP 2, focus group 1, &#x0003c;5 years).</p><p>Several participants felt numbers made it easier for patients to understand, and referred specifically to their experience of discussions around the risks of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to illustrate this:
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;I found it really useful prescribing HRT using the table in the</italic> BNF [<italic>British National Formulary</italic>], <italic>which has actual numbers for risk of breast cancer and thromboembolism and, if you give the patient actual numbers they seem to respond to that better than just saying &#x0201c;you have an increased risk&#x0201d; &#x02026; I think it&#x02019;s easier for patients to understand.&#x02019;</italic></p><attrib>(GP 5, focus group 4, 5&#x02013;10 years)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>There was much discussion in all groups about the relative advantages and disadvantages of presenting the risk of individual cancers, compared with presenting a combined risk for the most common cancers or those for which lifestyle factors have the biggest impact. All participants felt that there was a place for risk scores for individual cancers to be used with patients presenting with concerns about one or more cancers or wanting specific details. However, the general consensus was that a combined risk &#x02014; perhaps with details of the top cancers contributing to that risk &#x02014; might be better for general health promotion:

The challenge was finding the right time and accessing the right group of people:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;You have to have appropriate risk provided at appropriate times and that&#x02019;s the key isn&#x02019;t it really, so people have to be willing to hear the message.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(GP commissioner 1, focus group 5, 5&#x02013;10 years)</attrib></disp-quote>
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;<italic>People who worry about their health obsessively are the ones we see more and they&#x02019;re already worried about having cancer and probably already doing most things right &#x02026; whereas you want to get the message out to the people who are not in the doctor&#x02019;s surgery.</italic>&#x02019;</p><attrib>(GP 3, focus group 4, 5&#x02013;10 years)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>Across the groups, four main options to provide information about cancer risk within general practice were identified:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>opportunistically;</p></list-item><list-item><p>within NHS Health Checks;</p></list-item><list-item><p>within existing cancer screening programmes; or</p></list-item><list-item><p>within new-patient health appointments.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Most participants felt happy to discuss cancer risk opportunistically, but there was a general consensus that, although providing the information to older patients might be helpful, the focus should be on targeting younger people in their 20s and 30s for whom any lifestyle changes would have the greatest impact. In addition, focus group members felt that offering cancer risk estimates to people who attend general practice is likely to identify mostly older people and those who are already health conscious. A small number of GPs were also unsure how comfortable they would feel introducing the subject of cancer if it had not already come up in some way during the consultation:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;I&#x02019;d be happy using this tool &#x02014; there&#x02019;s a lot of positive things about it &#x02014; but I don&#x02019;t know how happy I&#x02019;d be using it just cold, in a sort of health promotion-type setting without giving the patient some kind of inkling that it might be coming.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(GP 4, focus group 4, &#x0003e;10 years)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>Adding cancer risk information to NHS Health Checks or sending information out with letters about national screening programmes was felt to make sense and to fit nicely:
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;Yeah,</italic> [fitting it into NHS Health Checks] <italic>would make perfect sense because they&#x02019;ve got all the information anyway because they&#x02019;re doing all the risk, they&#x02019;re doing all the lifestyle stuff anyway aren&#x02019;t they?&#x02019;</italic></p><attrib>(GP 6, focus group 4, 5&#x02013;10 years)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>However, it was recognised that the NHS Health Check programme was targeted at older people and that screening programmes, such as cervical screening, focus on women more than men. As a result, appointments for new patients were felt to be the least biased:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;I think women do engage with health concerns more than men. That&#x02019;s why if you had an avenue to collect people in a way that&#x02019;s not centred around this, but you could pick it up during that contact, so like the health questionnaires or a new patient, you know &#x02014; everybody&#x02019;s got to have a GP so you could incorporate it in there quite nicely and that way you wouldn&#x02019;t get a population bias.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(GP trainee 3, focus group 3, In training)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>Whichever route was chosen, however, there was a clear need for additional resources if it was going to be offered widely. Participants mentioned the need for additional funding and time:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;So it would have to be &#x02026; funded as an enhanced service if that was something that was going to be delivered in primary care in its own right, unless it was just an optional thing you say like many other things we know, you know, we have training on.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(GP 6, focus group 4, 5&#x02013;10 years)</attrib></disp-quote>
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;I think anything would have to be funded wouldn&#x02019;t it? Because we&#x02019;re kind of really stretched as it is.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Nurse 2, focus group 1, &#x0003e;10 years)</attrib></disp-quote>
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;&#x02026; if someone came in and said &#x0201c;Oh I&#x02019;m worried about my cancer risk, what can you tell me?&#x0201d; and then you thought &#x0201c;Oh I&#x02019;ve seen that risk score, I&#x02019;ll get that up and do it&#x0201d; but that would be a very rare scenario in primary care that someone would actually come in specifically asking about that one issue. They&#x02019;ll generally come in about something else</italic> &#x02026; <italic>I just think realistically it wouldn&#x02019;t get done unless it was sort of dedicated time.&#x02019;</italic></p><attrib>(GP 6, Focus group 4, 5&#x02013;10 years)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>Referral pathways were thought to be needed to support lifestyle change:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;And the other thing would depend on what avenues we had open to us to follow up &#x02026; I mean I see quite a lot of patients now who are worried about family history and we end up referring to clinical genetics with the family history questionnaires, and that&#x02019;s fine because you know you&#x02019;ve got something to offer them &#x02026; whereas with this we haven&#x02019;t got a pathway.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(GP 6, focus group 4, 5&#x02013;10 years)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>Participants also saw the importance of this being integrated into the computer system:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;&#x02026; if you want to get that out to every practice and every GP, then it needs to be integrated.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Clinical commissioner 1, focus group 5, &#x0003c;5 years)</attrib></disp-quote>
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;&#x02026; the computer system needs to be able to extract everything that it wants without having to type in extra information at the time, and you need to be able to click on a button and it just instantly spits out the whole thing ready for you, you know. You don&#x02019;t want to be having to go and re-enter, sort of, how many bits of fruit they ate in the last week before it&#x02019;ll produce its thing.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(GP 8, focus group 2, &#x0003e;10 years)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>The point that screening resources might also need to improve was also raised:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;I think you may have increased demand again from patients in terms of saying, &#x0201c;Well my risk is this high, I want this test and I want this screening, you know, I want to be screened.&#x0201d; So as long as that&#x02019;s accommodated for as well, and that&#x02019;s thought about.&#x0201d;</p><attrib>(GP trainee 1, focus group 3, in training)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>It was also recognised that training would be needed. One nurse (Nurse 2, focus group 1, &#x0003e;10 years) commented that <italic>&#x02018;&#x02026; everybody needs training&#x02019;</italic>, whereas a GP noted:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;Anyone could give you advice if they were trained to, trained in the risk tool and understood it.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(GP 4, focus group 4, &#x0003e;10 years)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>Additional barriers mentioned by those involved in commissioning services included the continued reorganisation of services over the last 10 years, movement of public health out of health care into the local authorities, and the current instability of funding:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;Public health was part of the health care, not part of the local authority, so you could actually agree pathways and can work together to do that, but now they&#x02019;re within local authority and the politics of local authority is completely different, you know, it&#x02019;s a different agenda.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Clinical commissioner 3, focus group 5, &#x0003c;5 years)</attrib></disp-quote>
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;The continued reorganisation that&#x02019;s gone on over the last 10 or so years has meant that smoking cessation has migrated from one community of providers to another &#x02026; if it&#x02019;s constantly changing so that even the GP isn&#x02019;t sure where the service is being provided, then that&#x02019;s probably not so helpful.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(GP commissioner 1, focus group 5, 5&#x02013;10 years)</attrib></disp-quote></p></sec><sec><title>Alternative settings</title><p>In addition to providing cancer risk information in general practice, all the groups felt it was important to increase the accessibility of the information, so people did not have to visit their GP, and to make use of technology to engage younger people.

<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;&#x02026; the only problem with making it too accessible is the interpretation. If a patient sees that and goes &#x0201c;Oh my God, I&#x02019;m going to die&#x0201d; &#x02026; actually you&#x02019;re there to interpret the information in the surgery.&#x02019;</p><attrib>(GP 3, focus group 4, 5&#x02013;10 years)</attrib></disp-quote></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Summary</title><p>This study showed that, among the UK health professionals who took part, there is support for providing personalised cancer risk information in general practice.

A diverse sample of health professionals was recruited in terms of sex, profession, and level of experience. The use of semi-structured, qualitative data collection allowed their views on key areas to be explored while areas they felt were important could be raised.</p><p>There are some limitations that should be noted, however. The sample size was small and all participants were recruited from one region in England, which limits the generalisability of the findings. The individuals and practices that took part were also those that chose to give up their time to participate, so it is possible they may be more interested in the subject and more supportive of using personalised cancer risk information than health professionals in the wider community.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with existing literature</title><p>The findings from this study are consistent with those from similar studies undertaken in the US,<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Australia,<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> and France.<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> As in those studies, there was not only support for providing cancer risk information in practice, but also recognition that trying to get people to change their behaviour is difficult,<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and there is a need for additional funding,<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> time,<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> integration into the current electronic health record,<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and training<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> for implementation to be successful.</p><p>One of the biggest challenges raised was finding the best time and place for the risk assessment. Participants in the study reported here felt that general practice was the most appropriate setting and that, ideally, the risk should be delivered face to face. This was also the view of breast surgeons and primary care physicians in the study in Australia.<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Other studies have, however, demonstrated the feasibility of providing the information via the internet,<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> as a leaflet,<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> or incorporated within screening programmes.<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p><p>The findings that almost all participants in this study thought the risk should be presented as a numerical estimate and that personalised messages were more likely to influence behaviour than messages directed towards the entire population is also consistent with previous reports.<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Implications for research and practice</title><p>Much of the lifestyle advice already provided in relation to CVD is relevant to cancer, so adding advice about cancer into practice could be relatively straightforward. However, this study highlighted a number of factors that should be considered when incorporating cancer risk information into general practice. The first is the format and content of the risk information. This study suggests addressing issues by:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>presenting a numerical estimate, with details of how that would be reduced in response to lifestyle changes for a combined cancer risk and the most common individual cancers;</p></list-item><list-item><p>providing information face to face in general practice; and</p></list-item><list-item><p>targeting younger people and those most likely to benefit from lifestyle changes, perhaps at new-patient health checks.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Health professionals, however, often have difficulty interpreting and communicating risk scores to patients.<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> In addition, previous studies on presenting cancer risk to individuals have highlighted the difficulties patients have understanding the concept of risk.<xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> It is also unlikely that one strategy will suit all and so further research is needed with both health professionals and patients to identify the optimal method of information provision.</p><p>The second is the need to provide additional resources, particularly time, funding, and referral pathways. At a time when demand for health care is increasing and funding decreasing, these are likely to be the greatest barriers. The ongoing reorganisation of the NHS and movement of public health away from health care into the remit of local authorities will also make introducing new prevention services more challenging. Any future initiatives will require the support not only of GPs and clinical commissioners, but also of public-health and third-sector organisations. Providing risk information via the internet, mobile applications, or written leaflets instead may be more cost-effective but this must be balanced against the risk of generating anxiety.</p><p>Finally, before personalised cancer risk information is introduced in any format, there must be some assurance that health professionals will not be causing harm. A recent systematic review of cancer risk assessment tools in primary care suggests their use could have beneficial effects without causing an increase in cancer-specific anxiety;<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> however, this hypothesis was based on only three trials so further research is needed to quantify the potential benefits and harms of providing cancer risk information in routine general practice.</p></sec></sec></body><back><notes><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This study was funded by an innovation grant from the Cancer Research UK &#x02014; BUPA Foundation Fund (ref: C55650/A20818).

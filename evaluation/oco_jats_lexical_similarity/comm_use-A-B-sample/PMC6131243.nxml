However, how and where <italic>Alpl</italic> acts in bone ageing is largely unknown. Here, we determined that ablation of <italic>Alpl</italic> induces prototypical premature bone ageing characteristics, including bone mass loss and marrow fat gain coupled with elevated expression of p16<sup>INK4A</sup> (p16) and p53 due to senescence and impaired differentiation in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Mechanistically, <italic>Alpl</italic> deficiency in MSCs enhances ATP release and reduces ATP hydrolysis. Then, the excessive extracellular ATP is, in turn, internalized by MSCs and causes an elevation in the intracellular ATP level, which consequently inactivates the AMPK&#x003b1; pathway and contributes to the cell fate switch of MSCs. Reactivating AMPK&#x003b1; by metformin treatment successfully prevents premature bone ageing in <italic>Alpl</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice by improving the function of endogenous MSCs. These results identify a previously unknown role of <italic>Alpl</italic> in the regulation of ATP-mediated AMPK&#x003b1; alterations that maintain MSC stemness and prevent bone ageing and show that metformin offers a potential therapeutic option.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="LongSummary"><title>Cell biology: diabetes drug prevents bone aging</title><p id="Par2">The diabetes drug metformin restores the ability of stem cells to grow and differentiate into bone-producing osteoblasts, preventing bone aging. The alkaline phosphatase gene (<italic>Alpl</italic>) has been implicated in abnormal bone and tooth development, but its role in bone aging was unclear. The protein it encodes is enriched in the cell membrane of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) &#x02013; precursors of bone-producing osteoblasts &#x02013; and is involved in the metabolism of ATP, which is implicated in MSC differentiation. Here, Yan Lin at the Xi&#x02019;an Institute of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine in China and colleagues demonstrate that Alpl deficiency contributes to bone aging by boosting levels of extracellular ATP. When internalized, this triggers the AMPK&#x003b1; pathway and impairs MSCs&#x02019; ability to grow and differentiate. Treatment with metformin reactivates this pathway and prevents premature bone aging.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>his work was financially supported through grants from the Nature Science Foundation of China (81620108007), the National key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFC1101400), Nature Science Foundation of China (31571532, 31601099) and National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services (R01DE017449 to S.S.).</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), which was initially identified in 1912,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> is a ubiquitous ectoenzyme widely distributed in nature from bacteria to humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> ALP is a well-known osteoblastic marker and has been widely used as a diagnostic index to evaluate bone formation capacity in osteoporosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> Clinically, a loss-of-function mutation in the liver/bone/kidney ALP (<italic>ALPL)</italic> gene has been linked to a severe skeletal deformity disease termed hypophosphatasia (HPP) that is characterized by bone mass loss and, consequently, pathological fractures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> A genetic study investigating <italic>ALPL</italic> in humans and mice strongly suggests that <italic>ALPL</italic> is necessary for postnatal bone formation and that the bone deformities are related to the degree of <italic>ALPL</italic> deficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> Despite the established function of <italic>ALPL</italic> in bone development, its role in bone ageing remains largely unknown.</p><p id="Par4">Bone ageing, which is the main risk factor for primary osteoporosis, results in a decrease in bone mass and a parallel increase in marrow fat.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> At the cellular level, bone marrow (BM) mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which are common progenitors of osteoblasts (OBs) and adipocytes in the BM,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> undergo senescence along with bone ageing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> We and other scholars have provided evidence that rescuing the function of MSCs has a significant therapeutic impact on the accrual of the regeneration capacity and bone mass.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> Tissue nonspecific ALP (TNSALP), which is encoded by <italic>ALPL</italic>, is used as a surface marker for the prospective isolation of MSCs because TNSALP is enriched in the cell membrane.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> However, whether and how <italic>ALPL</italic> orchestrates the differentiation and senescence of MSCs and subsequently affects bone ageing remain elusive.</p><p id="Par5">Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) has emerged as one of the most versatile extracellular molecules implicated in various cell processes ranging from energy supply to cell-to-cell signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> As an ectonucleotidase, TNSALP appears to be involved in the metabolism of nucleotides and can sequentially hydrolyze ATP, ADP and AMP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> Thus, the TNSALP level has been reported to be inversely correlated with the extracellular ATP concentration in neurocyte culture medium.

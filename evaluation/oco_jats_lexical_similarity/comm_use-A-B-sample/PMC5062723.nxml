heart valves, several centers have advocated aortic valve repair and/or
valve sparing aortic root replacement for patients with aortic valve
insufficiency, in order to enhance late survival and minimize adverse
postoperative events.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>From March/2012 thru March 2015, 37 patients consecutively underwent
conservative operations of the aortic valve and/or aortic root. Mean age was
48&#x000b1;16 years and 81% were males. The aortic valve was bicuspid in
54% and tricuspid in the remaining. All were operated with the aid of
intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography. Surgical techniques
consisted of replacing the aortic root with a Dacron graft whenever it was
dilated or aneurysmatic, using either the remodeling or the reimplantation
technique, besides correcting leaflet prolapse when present. Patients were
sequentially evaluated with clinical and echocardiographic studies and mean
follow-up time was 16&#x000b1;5 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Thirty-day mortality was 2.7%. In addition there were two late deaths, with
late survival being 85% (CI 95% - 68%-95%) at two years. Two patients were
reoperated due to primary structural valve failure. Freedom from reoperation
or from primary structural valve failure was 90% (CI 95% - 66%-97%) and 91%
(CI 95% - 69%-97%) at 2 years, respectively. During clinical follow-up up to
3 years, there were no cases of thromboembolism, hemorrhage or

aortic root or ascending aorta (AAo) dilatation, consists of isolated aortic valve
replacement (AVR) or total root replacement with the Bentall operation<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. Although immediate surgical
results are excellent, patients are exposed to the cumulative risks of late
prosthetic heart valve complications, including thromboembolic events, structural
(SVD) and nonstructural prosthetic valve dysfunction, bacterial endocarditis and
reoperations, not to say the inconvenient of permanent anticoagulation in the case
of mechanical substitutes<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. Frequently these procedures are
performed in young patients, which is associated with excess mortality when compared
to the normal age and gender matched population<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In theory, AVR and/or aortic valve sparing operations can restore near normal
function and hemodynamics of the aortic valve, reducing or eliminating complications
associated with conventional prosthetic heart prosthesis<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. On the other hand, aortic valve repair is
associated with a steep learning curve and requires a detailed knowledge and
understanding of the anatomy and functional inter-relation of all involved
structures, including the aortic cusps, annulus, sinuses of Valsalva (SV),
sinotubular junction (STJ) and AAo<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Although the theoretical principles for the conservative management of the aortic
valve are well established<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>,
several different surgical techniques have been described due to the wide anatomical
variations presented during the operations<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>. However, the
long-term results available does not permit to demonstrate the superiority of one
specific technique, making aortic repair still subjective, individually based and
depending on the best surgeon judgment<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. More recently, Lansac et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> have proposed a systematic surgical approach based
on well-defined anatomical criteria.</p><p>Even taking into account these limitations, several groups have reported excellent
immediate results and very encouraging durability with up to 15-20 years of
follow-up<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. Our experience with aortic valve repair began in
2012, and seemed appropriate to review our immediate and short-term clinical and
echocardiographic outcomes, in order to compare with those reported in the
international literature and define whether the application of these techniques is
safe and reproducible in our midst.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>This study was submitted to the Research Ethics Committee of Instituto de Neurologia

individually, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and/or transesophageal (TEE),
chest computed tomography scan or coronary angiography in order to obtain the
specific anatomical details involved in valvular dysfunction. Whenever anticipated
the possibility of performing an aortic valve repair, all available surgical
alternatives were discussed with each patient. For those who opted for a valve
repair strategy, the other options were already chosen, in case a conservative
approach was not feasible at the time of the operation.</p><sec><title>Surgical Technique</title><p>In all cases, monitoring was performed with intraoperative TEE used to quantify
and analyze the mechanisms involved in valvular insufficiency preoperatively and
to ascertain adequate post-surgical valve competence.</p><p>The operations were performed with a median thoracotomy with cardiopulmonary
bypass (CPB) and moderate hypothermia at 32&#x000b0;C. In cases where an open distal
anastomosis was required, the systemic temperature was reduced to 25&#x000b0;C for
adequate cerebral protection. Myocardial protection was achieved with infusion
of intermittent cold blood cardioplegic solution directly into the coronary
ostia. The mean aortic clamping was 85&#x000b1;23 min (min=45, max=131) and
the CPB was 108&#x000b1;28 min (min=60, max=170).</p><p>Routinely, a wide circumferential dissection of the aortic root was performed to
a level below the lowest point of the cusps insertion in the aortic annulus.
This can be laborious and tricky, especially in the area of the right coronary
cusp attachment, but right ventricular outflow and septal muscle should be
thoroughly dissected away from the aortic wall at this region. After aortic
cross-clamping, ascending aorta was circumferentially transected approximately 1
cm above the STJ, and proper exposure of the native valve was obtained.
Assessment of aortic valve geometry is not easy in the empty and arrested heart.
By using 3 commissural traction sutures, the axis of the aortic valve may be
oriented towards the surgeon's view. Moreover, by applying a vertical and
outward tension on those sutures, the cusps can be stretched, facilitating the
comparison between the free margin's height and length.</p><p>Valve analysis included meticulous observation of every anatomical structure,
including the dimensions of the aortic annulus, the sinuses and STJ, and
detailed inspection of the valve cusps, paying attention to its texture and the
presence of fenestrations. The judicious judgment of the dimensions of the
leaflets included the evaluation of its geometric height (LGH), the length of
their free margins (FML) and its insertion in the aortic annulus to estimate the
possible degree of prolapse in one or more cusps.</p><p>Prolapse identification was performed by comparing the height of one leaflet with
the adjacent one, and/or by measuring its effective height (ELH) with the aid of
a Schaefers caliper. In the case of prolapse of 1 or 2 cusps, the reference
height can be taken from the nonprolapsing cusp or cusps. Whenever identified
some degree of prolapse, the same has been corrected by reducing the length of
the free edge through central plication with 6-0 polypropylene sutures. When
this plication was quite extensive, the excess resulting tissue in the middle of
the leaflet was resected and reapproximated with interrupted sutures. Prolapse
of all 3 cusps is rare in the native AV, but it occasionally can be induced
after a valve-sparing procedure. In this situation, the reference used to
correct prolapse can be the middle height of the commissures, or it can be
determined with the Schaefer's caliper. In type 0 bicuspid valves, cusp prolapse
correction is performed as for tricuspid AVs, with either a nonprolapsing cusp
as the reference or restoration of the height of coaptation to the middle height
of the commissures. In type 1 valves, the median raphe is addressed first. If
the raphe is relatively mobile and only mildly thickened and fibrosed, it is
preserved and shaved. If the raphe is restrictive or calcified, a parsimonious
triangular resection of this tissue is performed. Next, the quantity of
remaining cusp tissue is assessed by putting the 2 arms of a 6-0 polypropylene
suture on the free margin of the conjoint cusp, on either side of the resected
raphe. At this point, lack of cusp restriction and good valve opening are signs
of the presence of adequate cusp tissue. The leaflet edges are reapproximated
primarily when adequate cusp tissue is present; in the absence of adequate
tissue, a triangular autologous treated or bovine pericardial patch is used for
cusp restoration. Next, the free margins of both cusps are compared for the
presence of any prolapse, which is corrected with free margin plication or
resuspension.</p><p>In cases with marked dilation of the aortic root (&#x0003e; 45 mm) , resection of all
aneurysmal tissues of the SV, the STJ and AAo was performed, and the
reconstruction made by the reimplantation technique described by David &#x00026;
Feindel<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> or the
remodeling technique described by Sarsam &#x00026; Yacoub<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>. In general, we have used the David
reimplantation technique for patients with dilated annulus and reserved the
Yacoub technique when the diameter of the aortic annulus is the normal range.
However, in some instances, annular reduction with an external circumferential
Dacron strip followed by an aortic remodeling graft as proposed by Lansac et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> has been
performed.</p><p>For the reimplantation technique, the proximal suture line is made with 6
pledgeted sutures (3 at each interleaflet triangle and 3 below the nadir of each
leaflet attachment) placed from the inside the left ventricular outflow tract,
and exiting outside the aortic root and geometrically anchored at proper points
in the Dacron graft. With this proximal suture line, any annular dilatation will
be corrected and set to the desired diameter. Then, under tension, the
commissures are resuspended inside the graft and the remnants of the aortic
sinus wall are carefully sutured in a scalloped fashion with running 5-0
polypropylene sutures. At this stage, cusp heights are reassessed, as induced
cusp prolapse may occur, and one or two additional stitches at the free margin
may occasionally be necessary. The coronary ostia are then reimplanted in their
corresponding locations with running sutures of 5-0 or 6-0 polypropylene
sutures. At this stage, valve competency is visually analyzed and can be
estimated by pressurizing the aortic graft with cardioplegic solution. The final
step is the distal anastomosis in the ascending aorta or the proximal aortic
arch.</p><p>For the remodeling technique, the Dacron graft is trimmed proximally to create
two or three tongues that will be sutured to the remnants of the aortic wall
with running 5-0 polypropylene sutures. These sutures start at the base of the
sinus wall running each side to the top of the commissures, taking care not to
damage the valve leaflets. The coronary reimplantation and distal anastomosis
are performed in the same fashion as in the David's technique. For the
remodeling technique, the aortic annulus was reduced with an external Dacron
strip whenever its diameter was greater than 25 mm.</p><p>The diameter of the Dacron graft varies depending on the technique used for
aortic reconstruction, but was mainly determined based on visual analysis of the
valve apparatus, by estimating the sum of FML and/or by measuring the distance
between the base of subcommissural triangle between the non- and left coronary

return in our clinic at 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively, and yearly
thereafter. In those who did not return, the information was obtained with the
reference cardiologist or by direct telephone contact with patients. Clinical
follow-up could be performed in all patients. The mean followup was
16&#x000b1;5 months (min=0.1, max=36).</p><p>Anticoagulation was indicated only in patients with associated mitral valve
disease and/or those with atrial fibrillation, or in the case of a
thromboembolic event postoperatively. The occurrence of postoperative
complications were defined and reported in accordance with well established
guidelines. For the functional analysis of the repaired valves, primary
structural dysfunction was considered in any case with moderate or severe AR or
a mean gradient greater than 40 mmHg.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using the "Prism 6" Mac program. Continuous
variables were reported as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation and were
compared with Student t-test when appropriate. Categorical variables were
expressed as percentages and analyzed with the chi -square test. The curves of
late survival and event-free survival were built with the Kaplan-Meier
method.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Early and Late Mortality</title><p>The 30-day mortality was 2.7% (1/37). This single death, due to uncontrollable
intraoperative bleeding, occurred in a patient with AI and late aneurysmal
dilatation of the aortic root after previous correction of an acute aortic
dissection performed in another service a few months before.</p><p>The incidence of immediate postoperative morbidity was low, and included four
cases of postoperative AF, a case of kidney failure not requiring dialysis and
one case of stroke that caused bilateral hemianopsia with partial recovery
leaving no other sequelae. Two patients required drainage puncture for
presenting pericardial effusion in the first 30 days of evolution. There were no
reoperations due to bleeding. The length of stay in the intensive care unit
varied from 1 to 5 days, with an average of 2.1 days.</p><p>There were two late deaths. The first was during a reoperation for primary
structural dysfunction of the valve repair, six months after the initial
operation. Another patient died of cancer 20 months later. By the Kaplan-Meier

patient had originally tricuspid valve with severe AI associated with aneurysm
of the aortic root. Surgical repair consisted of aortic root replacement with a
Dacron tube by the Yacoub technique plus central plication of non-coronary cusp.
Although aortic valve regurgitation was only trivial in the immediate
postoperative period, he developed acute AI at six months of follow-up. During
reoperation, we found rupture of the coronary leaflet in the commissural region
due to abrasion of the same along the suture line in the Dacron graft. He
underwent an aortic homograft root replacement, but died during this procedure.
The second patient with bicuspid aortic valve underwent valve repair which
consisted of external reduction of the aortic annulus with a Teflon strip
extending from the trigone to trigone plus extensive plication and resection of
the free margin of the fused cusp. This patient developed progressive AI,
requiring reoperation at 14 months of follow-up. During reoperation, dehiscence
was found in the leaflet plication suture with moderate to important thickening
at the leaflet edges. The reoperation consisted of a Ross procedure, with an
uneventful recovery.</p><p>By the Kaplan-Meier curve, 90% (CI 95% - 66%-97%) of patients are free from
reoperation at 3 years of follow-up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure

average echocardiographic follow-up was 10&#x000b1;6 months (min=0.5,
max=29). Aside from the two patients who developed moderate or severe AR and
were reoperated, all the others are stable with no, trivial or mild AI. During
this short period of follow-up, cusp mobility is well preserved without signs of
leaflet thickening. Leaflet coaptation has been maintained with effective
coaptation height &#x0003e; 5 mm in all patients. The mean gradient in the late
postoperative period was 11&#x000b1;9 mmHg (min=3, max=26), with no patient
with a peak gradient greater than 40 mmHg. By the Kaplan-Meier curve, 91% of the
patients (CI 95% - 69%-97%) are with normal functioning aortic valve two years
after the procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>After four decades of accumulated experience, mitral valve repair is considered the
procedure of choice in the surgical treatment of organic mitral regurgitation.
However, its acceptance and applicability could only be widely generalized after the
techniques have been standardized to allow consistent and reproducible early and
late results<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>. Based on these concepts, and with better
anatomical and physiological knowledge of the "aortic valve apparatus", several
centers started using aortic valve repair with progressively more satisfactory
results<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>. In our country, the only
meaningful series of aortic valve sparing/repair operations was reported by Dias et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>More recent studies have clarified in detail the anatomical relationships of the
different structures of "aortic valve apparatus" and allowed the understanding of
complex functional interrelationship between the valve and the aortic root. This has
enabled the development of techniques that restore valve competence and allows
physiological flow patterns in the left ventricular outflow tract and the aortic
root<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>This study confirmed that aortic valve repair and/or aortic root replacement surgery
sparing the native valve could be used with good immediate and short-term results in
the surgical treatment of AI due to various etiologies. Early mortality reported by
other centers ranged from 0.8% to 4.6%, but the comparison of results is quite
difficult, given the differences in indications and clinical profile of the operated
patients<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>. Our immediate mortality of 2.6% can be considered quite
acceptable, given the complexity of some cases involving acute aortic dissection,
reoperations and aneurysms involving the aortic arch. Our only death occurred in a
patient with aneurysmal dilatation of the aortic root after previous correction of
acute dissection, with important anatomical distortions and tissue fragility.</p><p>Restore valve competence systematically still remains a challenge, especially when
accumulated surgical experience is still small<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup>. Analysis of the
data reported in the literature clearly show that the success of the operation
depends upon the individual expertise and the volume of cases operated. Data from
the Society of Thoracic Surgeons revealed that less than 5% of the analyzed centers
performed more than 16 cases operations involving the aortic root annually, and that
conservative operations represent less than 20% of the operated cases<sup>[<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup>. These numbers suggest that
aortic valve repair should be concentrated in specialized reference centers
dedicated in performing these techniques in a routine basis.</p><p>The incidence of intraoperative residual or recurrent AI with up to 1 year of
follow-up can reach up to 30%, depending on the techniques employed<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup>. Its most frequent causes are the residual prolapse of one or
more cusps or failure to properly correct annular dilation over 25 mm<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup>. In this sense, it is mandatory to have
intraoperative monitoring with TEE, as the simple visual inspection or testing
aortic valve with saline injection in its flaccid state often underestimate residual
prolapses and are unsuitable for the determination of the ELH and the coaptation
surface after procedure.</p><p>To achieve lasting results, it is necessary that at the end of the repair procedure
not only the valve is competent, but also that the valve cusps coaptation line is in
a plane corresponding to approximatelly half the height of the SV<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup>. This concept was first described subjectively by El Khoury et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>, and later
reemphasized and objectively measurable with the concept of ELH introduced by
Schaefers et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup>. This height
can be measured during the operation with a specific caliper, and then confirmed by
TEE on the beating heart after termination of CPB. With this methodology, we found
the need to act aggressively to correct the FML of the leaflets in 59% of the cases,
which certainly contributed to our low incidence of immediate postoperative AI, and
maintenance of these results by up to 3 times years of follow-up.</p><p>In cases with marked dilation of the aortic root, there are controversies about the
best technique to be employed, reimplantation <italic>versus</italic>
remodeling<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>. The reimplantation technique has
the advantages of always correcting annular dilatation and be more hemostatic, but
it is more laborious and at the end of the procedure, the valve is inserted into a
straight tube without SV that prevents the physiological movement of subcommissural
triangles. In theory, these geometric changes would increase stress on the valve due
to abnormal opening and closing movements of the leaflets, besides allowing direct
contact of the cusps to the graft wall<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. Despite these
considerations, David<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>
demonstrated excellent long-term results with this technique, with 94% of patients
free from reoperation and 74% free from moderate or severe AI after 20 years of
follow-up. In addition, there is the possibility of creating neo SVs with some
technical refinements such as in the David V modification or by the use of Dacron
grafts that already have performed SV (Valsalva graft)<sup>[<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup>. On the other hand, the remodeling technique is
faster, and is considered more physiological for creating new SV, avoiding some of
the disadvantages of the reimplantation technique. However, this technique is more
prone to bleeding, and does not correct any eventual associated annular
dilatation<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>. Alternatively, as proposed by
Lansac et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>, the remodeling
technique may be combined with a separate external annular support ring to correct
the annular dimensions, a unique strategy to have the advantages of the two previous
techniques simultaneously.</p><p>The judgment in which patients would be better served by conservative techniques is
still rather speculative, since there are no randomized studies comparing the
long-term results of valve repair against valve replacement with biological and/or
mechanical prostheses<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>. However, some series with longterm follow-up seems to
indicate that patients undergoing aortic valve repair have long-term survival
approaching the normal matched population for age and gender, as opposed to
conventional valve prostheses where life expectancy is reduced, especially in young
patients<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup>. In our series we had only one
late death from cardiac causes, however, we will need larger series with longer
follow-up to confirm these trend.</p><p>Our clinical observations also confirm the excellent quality of life after aortic
valve repair. We observed excellent functional capacity, absence of thromboembolic,
hemorrhagic and infectious complications, and a significant number of patients do
not require any cardiotonic and/or anticoagulant medications.</p><p>One concern with aortic valve repair is the possible need for reoperation<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. In our series, we had two reoperations for primary structural
dysfunction that can be attributed to technical failures that could have been
avoided if our experience with these procedures were greater. As a result of certain
subjectivity and the somewhat "artistic" aspect of these operations, an initial
learning curve could already be anticipated<sup>[<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup>. At any rate, our 90% freedom from reoperation at 24
months, compares favorably with other published studies<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Aside from these two cases and despite the clinical and echocardiographic follow-up
time is still very limited and do not allow more definitive conclusions, we have not
observed increased levels of AI in the first 12-24 months of follow-up. Some
demographic, anatomical and technical aspects such as age, diameter of the valve
annulus, ELH post correction, commissural orientation lesser than 160&#x000ba; in bicuspid
valves and the need to use patches to fix defects in the leaflets were described as
risk factors for late AI and need for reoperation<sup>[<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup>. As our series is still early and has a small
number of cases, we were unable to analyze the importance of these variables.</p><p>As noted in this study, 40% of patients were aged between 20-40 years. In our
service, young aortic patients were routinely treated by the Ross operation.
However, the analysis of our longterm results of up to 18 years of follow-up with
this operation demonstrated unequivocally that patients with AI and annular
dilatation had a greater need for reoperation due to recurrent AI or aneurysmal
dilatation of the pulmonary autograft<sup>[<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup>. It seems to us that it is precisely in this sub-group of
patients, the valve repair techniques may result in less need of late reoperations,
but only with the continued clinical observation is that we will have more
conclusive answers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, the results presented here demonstrate that, despite representing an
initial series, aortic valve repair and/ or aortic root replacement operations
preserving the native valve can be performed safely and with satisfactory immediate
and short-term results. A detailed anatomical knowledge and adherence to the
technical principles of correction, always confirmed by intraoperative TEE seem
essential to obtain consistent results. Continuous surveillance of patient outcomes
and echocardiographic results will determine the role of these operations in
patients with aortic insufficiency.</p><table-wrap id="t4" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="10%" span="1"/><col width="90%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FDAC</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Analysis and/or data interpretation; statistical analysis; final

However, the molecular mechanisms that decide the fate of BMSCs remain unclear. In our study, microRNA-23a, and microRNA-23b (miR-23a/b) were found to be markedly downregulated in BMSCs of aged mice and humans. The overexpression of miR-23a/b in BMSCs promoted osteogenic differentiation, whereas the inhibition of miR-23a/b increased adipogenic differentiation. Transmembrane protein 64 (Tmem64), which has expression levels inversely related to those of miR-23a/b in aged and young mice, was identified as a major target of miR-23a/b during BMSC differentiation. In conclusion, our study suggests that miR-23a/b has a critical role in the regulation of mesenchymal lineage differentiation through the suppression of Tmem64.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Osteoblast-mediated bone formation, a key determinant of bone mass, maintains bone homeostasis along with osteoclast-mediated bone resorption.

We confirmed the decreased level of miR-23a/b qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), and we then measured the levels of miR-23a/b in human BMSCs that were isolated from the bone marrow cells of patients aged either 20 to 40 or &#x0003e;70 years.

Taken together, these findings indicate that miR-23a/b has a crucial effect on the aging process of BMSCs in both mouse and human.</p><p>miR-23a and miR-23b belong to the same family and have strong similarities in their nucleotide sequences, and importantly, they function as synergistic regulators of BMSC functions. Previously, it had been reported that miR-23a/b reinforces the expression of glutaminase in mitochondria and participates in glutamine metabolism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> Several studies have shown that the activation of miR-23a by NFATc3 regulates cardiac hypertrophy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> and that miR-23b inhibits autoimmune inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> However, there had been no studies of the action of miR-23a/b on the regulation of BMSC differentiation.</p><p>Our study confirmed that miR-23a/b has promoting effects on the osteogenic differentiation of mouse BMSCs <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, Hassan and colleagues have reported that miR-23a had an inhibitory role in the maturation of primary rat osteoblasts and mouse MC3T3-E1 cells through the targeting of SATB2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> These two results are not likely to be contradictory because different cell types show specificity and different mechanisms of action, which could explain these inconsistent results. Moreover, a microRNA can regulate the expression of multiple target genes; therefore, the miR-23 target genes that are relevant to osteoblast maturation and BMSC differentiation might be different. In the present study, we demonstrated that <italic>Tmem64</italic> was the major target of miR-23a/b during mouse BMSC differentiation.</p><p>miRNAs have been reported to downregulate gene expression by inhibiting mRNA translation or reducing mRNA stability through binding to sites in the CDS or 3&#x02032;-UTR of the target gene.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> Studies have indicated that <italic>Fas</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup>

<italic>Has2</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> and <italic>Hes1</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>) are potential target genes of miR-23a or miR-23b. In this study, we demonstrated that <italic>Tmem64</italic> was directly targeted by miR-23a/b and was responsible for regulating BMSC differentiation. Tmem64 has been found to positively modulate osteoclast differentiation via RANKL-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> Recently, it was shown that mice in which the <italic>Tmem64</italic> gene was silenced presented increased osteoblast and decreased adipocyte differentiation from BMSCs. Conversely, the overexpression of Tmem64 accelerated adipogenesis and inhibited osteogenesis. Tmem64 regulates the switch in the lineage commitment of MSCs to adipogenesis rather than to osteogenesis by suppressing &#x003b2;-catenin, the key Wnt signaling molecule.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> Our study revealed that miR-23a/b mediates BMSC differentiation by post-transcriptionally repressing Tmem64 expression. The decline in miR-23a/b expression in BMSCs with age results in an attenuation of the suppression of Tmem64 and consequently the increased expression of Tmem64 protein, which inhibits the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway. Consequently, the regulation of Tmem64 causes BMSCs to have a tendency towards favoring differentiation into adipocytes rather than osteoblasts.</p><p>A previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> revealed that the level of miR-188 expression is markedly higher in BMSCs from aged compared with young mice and humans, and the BMSC-specific inhibition of miR-188 stimulated new bone formation. In the present study, our results showed that miR-23a/b levels are decreased in BMSCs from aged compared with young mice and humans, and the activation of miR-23a/b in BMSCs promoted osteogenic differentiation. These findings suggest that the upregulation of miR-23a/b in BMSCs could be a potential therapeutic target for osteoporosis.</p></sec></body><back><notes><p>The authors declare no conflicts of interest.</p></notes><ref-list><ref id="bib1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">Pittenger MF, Mackay AM, Beck SC et al. <article-title>Multilineage potential of adult human mesenchymal stem cells</article-title>. <source>Science</source>

<bold>Background</bold>: The Human Heredity and Health in Africa consortium
(H3Africa) was conceived to facilitate the application of genomics technologies
to improve health across Africa. Here, we describe how the Collaborative African
Genomics Network (<italic>CAfGEN)</italic> of the H3Africa consortium is using
genomics to probe host genetic factors important to the progression of HIV and
HIV-tuberculosis (TB) coinfection in sub-Saharan Africa.
&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;</p><p id="P4">
<bold>Methods</bold>: <italic>CAfGEN</italic> is an H3Africa collaborative
centre comprising expertise from the University of Botswana; Makerere
University; Baylor College of Medicine Children&#x02019;s Clinical Centers of
Excellence (COEs) in Botswana, Uganda, and Swaziland; as well as Baylor College
of Medicine, Texas. The COEs provide clinical expertise for community
engagement, participant recruitment and sample collection while the three
University settings facilitate processing and management of genomic samples and
provide infrastructure and training opportunities to sustain genomics
research.</p><p id="P5">
<bold>Results</bold>: The project has focused on utilizing whole-exome
sequencing to identify genetic variants contributing to extreme HIV disease
progression phenotypes in children, as well as RNA sequencing and integrated
genomics to identify host genetic factors associated with TB disease progression
among HIV-positive children. These cohorts, developed using the COEs&#x02019;
electronic medical records, are exceptionally well-phenotyped and present an
unprecedented opportunity to assess genetic factors in individuals whose HIV was
acquired by a different route than their adult counterparts in the context of a
unique clinical course and disease pathophysiology.</p><p id="P6">
<bold>Conclusions</bold>: Our approach offers the prospect of developing a
critical mass of well-trained, highly-skilled, continent-based African genomic
scientists. To ensure long term genomics research sustainability in Africa,
<italic>CAfGEN </italic>contributes to a wide range of genomics capacity and
infrastructure development on the continent, has laid a foundation for genomics
graduate programs at its institutions, and continues to actively promote
genomics research through innovative forms of community engagement brokered by
partnerships with governments and academia to support genomics policy
formulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>Bioinformatics</kwd><kwd>Genetics</kwd><kwd>Genomics</kwd><kwd>HIV/AIDS</kwd><kwd>Pediatrics</kwd><kwd>Tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>Education</kwd><kwd>Development</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P7">In 2011, a group of scientists came together and conceived the white paper
&#x0201c; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://h3africa.org/images/PDF/h3africa_whitepaper.pdf">Harnessing Genomic Technologies Toward Improving Health in
Africa: Opportunities and Challenges</ext-link>&#x0201d;. This white paper was
used to solicit ideas from senior African scientists and scientists with extensive
research experience in African populations, and ultimately led to the creation of
the Human Heredity and Health in Africa (H3Africa) initiative. A major theme was to
solicit suggestions for research priorities, infrastructure development, human
resource training, and coalescing researchers working in Africa. The long-term goal
of H3Africa was to increase the capacity to do cutting-edge genomic and biomedical
research in Africa as a means of improving health<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. To facilitate this, it became clear that there needed to be systemic
improvements in the way African research was funded and how African scientists were
trained. Currently, much research in Africa is funded through foreign granting
mechanisms<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and many PhD level scientists
in Africa have received their training at foreign institutions<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. Unfortunately, scientists often leave for training and
do not return to Africa because of limited opportunities on the continent<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. H3Africa was initiated, in part, to reverse
this &#x02018;brain drain&#x02019; and has already made substantial strides towards
this goal.</p><p id="P8">The completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003 catapulted efforts to use
genetics to enhance our understanding of human diseases<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. Key to this, is identifying and utilizing variation in
the human genome that is associated with disease-specific onset, complications, or
outcomes. Some inherited diseases, such as Sickle cell disease (SCD), are caused by
relatively straightforward variation in a single-gene, while others, such as heart
disease, are the result of a complex interplay of factors that can include a
multitude of both genetic and environmental influences, acting to both increase or
decrease susceptibility. Added to this are circumstances where there is
inter-individual variation in infection susceptibility or resistance<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> or severity of
infection<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, and host genetics can also play a major role in
determining the most effective treatment for diseases such as cancer or predicting
adverse reactions to certain drugs<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>.</p><p id="P9">Genetics and genomics have a particularly important role to play in
biomedical research as DNA variation both directly and indirectly impacts disease
outcomes<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. Understanding this variation, therefore, has the
potential to lead to a better understanding of the biology, physiology, and chemical
pathways involved in disease and can help direct scientists to new areas of research
that may result in better medications and treatment options. To date, this approach
has yielded several pharmacogenomic biomarkers that have been translated into
clinical practice, affecting the use of medications to improve quality of life for
individuals on specific treatments<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>.
Reflecting on the safety of antiretroviral medications; in sub-Saharan Africa,
efavirenz forms the preferred first-line anti-retroviral therapy for those over the
age of 3 years but adverse drug events have been reported. Additionally, some
HIV-infected individuals of African origin are predisposed to developing adverse
efavirenz-induced neuropsychiatric responses due to variants in
<italic>CYP2B6</italic> that impair normal metabolism of efavirenz<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. The <italic>CYP2B6*6</italic> allele occurs
at a high frequency in people of African origin and is associated with high
efavirenz concentrations and genotype-screening is recommended in these
populations<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. Genomic screening in
populations has also identified the <italic>HLA-B*5701</italic> variant that
predicts Abacavir hypersensitivity; assays for this variant are now routinely
performed ahead of time to minimize drug associated reactions in the Western
world<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. Africa is classically considered to be the well-spring of modern
humanity; and thus, comprises the greatest human genetic diversity among major world
populations<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. In addition, Africa hosts a wide variety of
pathogens, climates, lifestyles, and habitats, some of which are unique to the
continent. These observations underscore the immense potential for learning more
about human health and our environment through systematic study of the interplay of
genetics and environment in African populations<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. </p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Genesis of the Collaborative African Genomics Network (

accomplishing this mission, a highly collaborative, synergistic, network of
institutions has been assembled.</p><p id="P25">Firstly, the project draws upon the extensive clinical and research
experience of the Botswana, Swaziland and Uganda COEs - together the three COEs have
&#x0003e;35 years of experience providing state-of-the-art care and treatment of
paediatric HIV that extends to &#x0003e;20,000 HIV-infected children across Botswana,
Swaziland and Uganda. The COEs are headquarters for countrywide research related to
the care, treatment, and prevention of paediatric HIV/AIDS and co-occurring diseases
and are affiliated with the Baylor International Pediatric AIDS Initiative (BIPAI) -
a state-of the-art paediatric HIV/AIDS health care network that spans across 11
African nations, including major centres in Malawi, Lesotho, and Tanzania, which
have expressed strong interest in collaborating with <italic>CAfGEN</italic>. The
COEs are the clinical backbone of <italic>CAfGEN</italic>; their expertise
substantially mitigates the challenges of proper phenotyping and sample numbers
needed for large-scale genomics.</p><p id="P26">To this backbone, we appended molecular genetics expertise at two
universities that are closely (geographically and academically) related to the COEs:
Makerere University, Uganda, one of the most prestigious academic universities in
East Africa<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, has extensive experience with
infectious disease and genetic studies, including <italic>Mycobacterium
tuberculosis</italic> and HIV; and the University of Botswana (UB), which has a
growing expertise in human genetics and significant monetary and human investment in
molecular genetics, bolstered by a multi-million dollar Medical Education
Partnership Initiative (MEPI) grant, with which <italic>CAfGEN</italic> shared a
Principal Investigator.</p><p id="P27">To further develop the genetic and genomic capabilities of the network, we
partnered with Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, to afford trainees
access to high-level genomics expertise, including hands-on laboratory experiences,
didactic coursework, data analysis, and a variety of other educational
activities<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. These activities are then
transferred to the home African countries and become rooted in the provision of new
faculty with high-level training and expertise &#x02013; North-South collaboration
for the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p><p id="P28">The culmination of these centres, as shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> below, is the genesis for a unique African alliance using a
highly synergistic approach to contribute novel and important mechanistic insights
to disease progression in paediatric HIV and HIV-TB co-infection.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Specific aims of <italic>CAfGEN</italic>
</title><p id="P29">Disproportionately few advanced genetic and genomic studies have involved
the indigenous peoples of Africa, and even fewer have included African paediatric
populations<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. Yet, paradoxically, these populations collectively
carry a large proportion of the human disease burden that results in significant
mortality and morbidity. HIV/AIDS and TB &#x02013; HIV&#x02019;s most frequent
co-morbidity &#x02013; exemplify this scientific disparity; together, HIV and HIV-TB
result in more than 500,000 new childhood cases every year (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/MDG_FS_6_EN.pdf">UN report on combatting HIV/AIDS, Malaria and Other
Diseases</ext-link>). Studies of host genetic factors underlying Long-Term
Non-Progressors (LTNPs) of HIV infection have led to new therapies through the
identification of loci that are important to <italic>in vivo</italic> control of
virus pathogenicity<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. Similarly, a detailed
understanding of the temporal <italic>in vivo</italic> host molecular events
occurring in the progression to active TB disease in the face of HIV co-infection,
could significantly impact development of effective therapeutic strategies. Although
genomic approaches have been used to identify host response pathways that are
important to TB-disease progression, almost all of these studies were undertaken in
non-African, adult populations. HIV-infected Africans and particularly children -
who have a different route of acquisition, clinical course, and pathophysiology from
their adult counterparts - have not been included, although they potentially have
more to ultimately contribute and gain from any therapeutic advances.
<italic>CAfGEN</italic> envisaged a project that encompassed 5 inter-related
aims:</p><list list-type="simple" id="L3"><list-item><label/><p id="P30">
<italic>Aim 1a</italic>: Recruit a cohort of well-phenotyped paediatric HIV
and HIV-TB infected patients. Retrospectively recruit 500 LTNPs and 500
rapid progressors (RPs) controls through the Electronic Medical Record
(EMR).</p></list-item><list-item><label/><p id="P31">

HIV disease progression susceptibility loci in paediatric HIV by undertaking
gene sequencing and allelotyping of candidate loci in RP and LTNP
patients.</p></list-item><list-item><label/><p id="P33">
<italic>Aim 2b</italic>: Identify novel host alleles influencing paediatric
HIV disease progression by conducting whole-exome sequencing to identify

<italic>Aim 4</italic>: Establish and enhance undergraduate, graduate, and
faculty education in genetics/genomics and provide opportunities for long-
and short-term training of scientists and technicians from African
universities.</p></list-item><list-item><label/><p id="P37">
<italic>Aim 5</italic>: Establish genetic and genomic technologies and
supporting laboratory and physical infrastructure for large-scale
genetic/genomic analyses of common diseases in Africa.</p></list-item></list><p id="P38">These strategic aims were designed to create independent, sustainable
genomics facilities in Africa that recruit and train new scientists in genomics, who
can then apply these technologies to solve widespread relevant problems in human
diseases in Africa.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S5"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S6"><title>Infrastructure development</title><p id="P39">The clinically important research goals of <italic>CAfGEN</italic> are
set to uncover specific genetic markers and genes that reflect the greatest risk
for progression in HIV disease and to gain new insights into the pathophysiology
of HIV and HIV-TB coinfection, in order to ultimately facilitate development of
new treatment strategies. The current lack of substantial work in these areas in
the two main <italic>CAfGEN</italic> countries reflects a general maxim
underlying the lack of sustainable genetic research in Africa - the dual
deficiencies of too little expertise and supporting infrastructure. In keeping
with the mission and vision of H3Africa, the <italic>CAfGEN</italic> approach to
its primary research goals framed each project in the context of an opportunity
to build sustainable genomics capacity and develop genomics infrastructure.
Consequently, all <italic>CAfGEN</italic> research projects are interrelated and
are deliberately designed to impart transferable expertise that stretches across
the breadth of genetic and genomics studies: study design, Ethical Legal and
Social Issues (ELSI), consent and sample collection, sample processing and
storage, data generation and bioinformatics, statistical analysis of association
studies and publication of results (<italic><xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>: illustrates the core branches
of the network</italic>). Further, each project has a tangible upgrade in
physical infrastructure and capacity. At the end of the grant period,
<italic>CAfGEN</italic> researchers and clinicians will have been equipped
with a solid understanding of how the rapidly changing world of genomics can be
applied to answer the most pressing questions on African continent. Moreover,
they are receiving the necessary equipment and facilities to design and
implement future genomics studies in a culturally sensitive, sustainable fashion
that engenders public trust, acceptance and avoids the pitfalls of some genomic
research models of the past. The administrative personnel were trained in grants
management and oversight equipping them with skills to administer large,
multicenter research grants.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Ethics and informed consent</title><p id="P40">Each participating institution had to undergo ethical review processes
by the respective institutional review boards (IRBs), followed by the submission
of the research protocol by the main applying institution, being the
Botswana-Baylor Children&#x02019;s Clinical Centre of Excellence in Gaborone, to
the Botswana Ministry of Health Research and Development Committee for ethical
approval. IRB approvals were obtained for all participating institutions.</p><p id="P41">Written informed consent was sought from the participant and/or their
parents or legal guardians. Consent forms were prepared in both English and the
main local language at each study site (Luganda in Uganda and Setwana in
Botswana). The parent or legal guardian of participants who were younger than
the legal age of consent (18 years in Uganda and 21 years in Botswana) were
provided written informed consent. Those who were older than the legal age of
consent signed for themselves. Assent forms were prepared for children and
adolescents aged between 12 and the legal age of consent (in addition to their
parents/legal guardians&#x02019; written informed consents). All subjects were
free to decline participation in the study and it was made clear that
non-participation would not affect any aspect of medical care they were
receiving.</p><p id="P42">While HIV infection and its comorbidities remain the central foci of the
project, the broader <italic>CAfGEN</italic> goal is to empower new
investigators with a wide array of skills that are required to examine any
clinical problem that would be suitable for a genomics approach. We envisioned a
critical mass of well-trained, highly knowledgeable, African human geneticists
and genomicists each with a broad spectrum of expertise, the knowledge and
support to secure outside funding, the ability to educate future generations of
researchers, and the experience to collaboratively empower clinicians and
researchers in a multi-disciplinary manner.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Identification, selection and training of CAfGEN trainees</title><p id="P43">During the first award period of the grant (2014 to 2016), six trainees
were identified - three each from Botswana and Uganda. Trainees were recruited
through the University of Botswana and Makerere University via both internal and
external advertising. Selection criteria included a postgraduate science degree,
with preference given to those in the fields of genetics, cell biology,
biostatistics, and computer science<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>.
Candidates who were short-listed based on their academic background and an essay
describing their motivation, as well as testimonials provided by three of their
academic referees, were subsequently invited for oral interviews conducted by a
panel of university staff. Potential scholarship recipients identified at this
stage were required to successfully register with the university as PhD students
and submit a research proposal based on the <italic>CAfGEN</italic> research
objectives.</p><p id="P44">The selection process took approximately three months at each
university. Trainees took graduate genomics and bioinformatics courses,
seminars, and workshops that were not available at their home institutions. They
also undertook laboratory rotations at selected BCM departments such as the
United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)/Agricultural Research Service
(ARS) Children&#x02019;s Nutrition Research Center, Human Genome Sequencing
Center, Center for Statistical Genetics, RNA-Sequencing, as well as the
Computational and Integrative Biomedical Research Center. In addition, they
participated in the annual BCM&#x02019;s Department of Molecular and Human
Genetics sponsored two-day retreats at Galveston, Texas where they each
presented their PhD concepts and proposals. The trainees have published a
peer-reviewed report detailing their perspective on training the next generation
of African genomic scientists<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. All the
six students successfully completed more than two years of training at BCM and
returned to their respective universities to continue with their PhD studies.
Their home universities will assimilate them into genomics faculty positions on
completion of their PhDs.</p><p id="P45">The two participating African universities have enthusiastically
embraced genomics training fulfilling <italic>CAfGEN</italic>&#x02019;s long-term
objectives. Tangible strides to nurture the era of genomics at the collaborating
institutions have been realized already such as the inauguration of a new
department of Immunology and Molecular biology at Makerere University; this is a
home for the genomics and bioinformatics graduate programs for which
<italic>CAfGEN</italic> laid the foundation stone.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Recruitment of study participants</title><p id="P46">Initially, the COEs in Botswana and Uganda were involved in the study
participant recruitment. A cohort of well-phenotyped paediatric HIV and HIV-TB
infected patients was recruited retrospectively through the EMR, and consisted
of 500 LTNPs and 500 RPs. In addition, we recruited HIV-positive children who
also progressed to active TB disease. Swaziland COE was added later on to boost
the enrolment in the TB case-control component of the study. Blood samples were
drawn from the participants and sent to the two universities for the preparation
of DNA and RNA.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Power considerations and replication of results</title><p id="P47">The <italic>CAfGEN</italic> study is divided into discovery and
replication phases. To provide a broad approximation of the power of our study,
we made a number of assumptions: a) variants with estimated minor allele
frequencies &#x0003e; 0.05; b) an alpha (&#x003b1;) value for statistical significance
of <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01; c) a genetic relative risk (GRR) of between two
and four for LTNP-associated variants d) a log additive disease model. Under
these assumptions and using the methods of Gauderman implemented in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biostats.usc.edu/cgi-bin/DownloadQuanto.pl">Quanto</ext-link> 1.2.4, where a sample size of 200

differences between groups at <italic>&#x003b2;</italic> = 0.80 discovery) of the
study. Variants meeting an association threshold of <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01
are carried forward for targeted allele typing in 300 LTNPs and 300 RPs in the
replication phase.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Community engagement</title><p id="P48">Community engagement is a key requirement for the overall H3Africa goal
of long-term sustainability and has been a prominent feature of the
<italic>CAfGEN</italic> plan. We have used a variety of training and
educational programs in the form of classroom lectures, workshops, and
laboratory training as described below.</p><p id="P49">
<italic>Classroom training:</italic>
</p><list list-type="simple" id="L4"><list-item><label>a) </label><p id="P50">Ethics in Research and Informed Consent: emphasis on African
populations. This lecture targeted health care professionals who were
actively engaged with recruited patients for genomics research studies.
Special emphasis was given to the challenges that confront carrying out
such studies in African populations including informed consent and
assent, stigmatization, and effectively conveying the potential impact
of such research on the current and future health. This course has been
included in the new genomics graduate programs at Makerere
University.</p></list-item><list-item><label>b) </label><p id="P51">The importance of genomics to human health (community outreach).
This lecture targeted community lay persons and emphasized basic
concepts of heredity, genetics, and genomics, common community relevant
human genetic conditions (e.g., albinism and Sickle cell disease), and
the importance of genomics research to human health and research
participants&#x02019; protections.</p></list-item></list><p id="P52">
<italic>Workshops</italic>: A variety of practical workshops were carried out by
the COEs to provide training to individuals within and outside the
<italic>CAfGEN</italic> network. The workshops were administered by the COEs
including specific expertise such as; a) sputum induction in the children, b)
Laboratory procedures for HIV testing, c) collection and processing of whole
blood samples for research studies, d) effective use of EMR for research
studies, and e) effective counselling to maximize patient compliance and
research study participation.</p><p id="P53">Other innovative community engagement activities included the production
of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://botswanabaylor.org/genome_adventures.html">Genome Adventures comic books</ext-link>. In these
series; Kitso, a young man takes a journey with the superheroes to explore the

media platforms such as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genomeadventures.weebly.com/">Weebly</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.facebook.com/genomeadventures">Facebook</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://twitter.com/GenomeAdventure">Twitter</ext-link>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/genomeadventure/">Pinterest</ext-link>. These books have been translated
into several languages such as Setswana, Swahili, Luganda, Arabic, Hausa,
French, and Portuguese. This project was funded jointly by the Wellcome Trust
and the US National Institutes of Health initiatives.</p><p id="P54">We also shared close working relations with the Botswana Harvard AIDS
Institute Partnership (BHP), a world-renowned institution of excellence in
research and education pertinent to HIV/AIDS and other emerging public health
challenges. The more than 20 years of collaborative research and training
experience at BHP was highly valuable to <italic>CAfGEN.</italic> Their research
areas include virology, molecular biology, immunology, human genetics,
epidemiology, and social and behavioral issues relevant to the AIDS epidemic in
Botswana and southern Africa. We further maintained routine interactions with
the community leaders and institutional review boards and community leaders
through community advisory boards made up of local community leaders.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Genomic sample processing, bioarchiving, and shipping</title><p id="P55">Uniquely labeled blood samples were collected using PAXgene Blood DNA
and RNA tubes at the COEs and transported to both the University of Botswana
(Department of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Sciences) and Makerere University
(Molecular Diagnostics laboratory, Department of Immunology and Molecular
Biology) where genomic DNA and RNA was extracted. The team utilized the already
existing molecular genetics expertise at these two universities to successfully
perform extraction of high quality DNA and RNA for subsequent sequencing and
genotyping. Samples were quantified using either a Nanodrop 2000
spectrophotometer or a Qubit 2.0 Fluorimeter. Sample quality was assessed by
agarose gel electrophoresis. Samples were stored in a -80&#x000b0;C freezer at the
H3Africa Integrated Biorepository at Makerere University. Genomic DNA and RNA
were shipped, as per the requirements of the Centers for Diseases Control and
Prevention (CDC) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA), to the
Human Genome Sequencing Center and the Children's Nutrition Research Center at
BCM for WES and RNA sequencing, respectively. Aliquots of all samples are stored
at the Biorepository at Makerere University.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Genomic data analyses and accomplishments</title><p id="P56">Following the completion of more than two years of didactic training in

African Society for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (ASBCB) at Entebbe,
Uganda; from October 10 &#x02013; 13, 2017<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>.</p><p id="P59">The trainees have also cultivated collaborations and networks that are
important for sustaining and development of genomics capacity in Africa. These
include; Bridging Biobanking and Biomedical Research across Europe and Africa
(B3Africa), this collaboration enabled Makerere University to receive eB3Kit

ethical and legal framework, a training component. This server has been very useful
in the genomics trainings/workshops held at Makerere. It provides a linux
environment which is remotely utilized by workshop participants.
<italic>CAfGEN</italic> trainees have been able to apply for collaborative
funding opportunities and awarded a fellowship by the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cambridge-africa.cam.ac.uk/initiatives/thrive/thrive-2-fellows/gerald-mboowa/">THRiVE Consortium</ext-link> (Training Health Researchers

Makerere University &#x02013; Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) Centre of
Excellence for Infection and Immunity Research and Training
(<italic>MUII-Plus</italic>). The MUII is passionate about the development of
bioinformatics in Uganda. They have offered both bioinformatics grants and travel
scholarships to the trainees to present their PhD work during the ISCB/ASCB at
Entebbe in October, 2017. Trainees are also taking part in grant application
processes at their home institutions. This is critical for sustainability of the
genomics milestones attained through <italic>CAfGEN</italic> funding; trainees also
continue to assist in external sequencing projects and genomic data analyses at
their home institutions.</p><p id="P61">To develop pedagogical skills, trainees are equally involved in teaching
undergraduate courses such as introduction to bioinformatics, fundamental genetics
&#x00026; molecular biology for non-medical students and introduction to bioinformatics
and medical genomics for MBChB (medical) students. This is an important strategy to
ensure trainees retention as faculty as well as knowledge and skills transfer.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Capacity building and infrastructure development</title><p id="P62">The <italic>CAfGEN</italic> project has enabled six PhD students to
successfully complete their intensive genomics training at BCM. They are all being

offers a unique training arrangement to students who have special interest in
genomics and bioinformatics to attend weekly tutorials and practical sessions
offered by faculty genomics mentors throughout the year. The program is currently
training four students at Makerere University (D43TW010045-03).
<italic>CAfGEN</italic> trainees are at the centre of these trainings and

for bioinformatics at the Makerere University College of Health Sciences. The server
is being used by students in the genomics mentorship programs and will soon be
utilized by the genomics graduate programs at Makerere University.
<italic>CAfGEN</italic> has already fostered many endeavors that are
sustainable, productive, impactful, and transformative in both the satellite
countries and the continent at large in constructing strong networks and strategies
to achieve the goals of the H3Africa initiative. In addition to the above, other
highlights include;</p><p id="P64">1. To ensure long-term, high-quality, sustainable human genetic and genomics
studies in Africa, one of our principal investigators (Dr. Moses Joloba) received
funding and set up the largest biorepository in East Africa, the Integrated
Biorepository of H3Africa Uganda - IBRH3AU.</p><p id="P65">2. To ensure best practices governing <italic>CAfGEN</italic> and future
genomics studies in Africa, our center at Makerere University was awarded an NIH U01
grant entitled &#x0201c;Ethical and social issues in informed consent processes in
African genomic research funding (Principal investigator: Dr. Erisa Sabakaki Mwaka,
Makerere University College of Health Sciences, Uganda). This project aims to
increase awareness and protection of the interests of research participants
regarding ELSI (U01-HG009810-01). </p><p id="P66">3. The "Nurturing Genomics and Bioinformatics Research Capacity in Africa
(BRecA)" program, which builds on the momentum of <italic>CAfGEN</italic>, was
awarded to Dr. Kateete David and Dr. Graeme Mardon by the Fogarty International
Center to establish sustainable genomics and bioinformatics graduate programs at
Makerere University (U2RTW010672). Both masters and PhD graduate programs in
Genomics and Bioinformatics are in the final stages of approval at Makerere.
<italic>CAfGEN</italic> alumni are also highly active in these training
programs.</p><p id="P67">4. <italic>CAfGEN</italic> trainees continue to be outstanding in so many
ways including winning travel scholarship awards for both oral and poster
presentations at different H3Africa consortium meetings, trainings, and workshops,
in 2017 during this 10<sup>th</sup> H3A consortium meeting, a
<italic>CAfGEN</italic> trainee excelled and was awarded the prize for the best
poster presenter. Another trainee made both an oral and poster presentation during
the ISCB/ASCB conference. They have presented their work at several other
conferences such as the UCSF-Gladstone - Centers for AIDS Research (CFAR)
9<sup>th</sup> East Africa Collaborative Scientific Symposium at the Infectious
Diseases Institute in Kampala, Uganda on the 19 &#x02013; 20<sup>th</sup> of January
2017. At the end of their training, we envisage a team of African human geneticists
and genomicists who have a broad spectrum of expertise and knowledge that will
enable them compete for and secure outside funding while they continue the cycle of
educating future generations of researchers. </p><sec id="S15"><title>Challenges encountered</title><p id="P68">Implementing the <italic>CAfGEN</italic> project has not been without
challenges, through which we have learnt valuable lessons. Retention of
personnel has continued to be a problem at all levels of academia and
<italic>CAfGEN</italic> has been no different as some of the
<italic>CAfGEN</italic> personnel have since moved on to more lucrative job
offers; delayed project approvals/renewals have also been a fact of life - the
project required ethics approvals to be in place at all the involved
institutions, although genomics studies are new territory for any of the local
ethics/Institutional Review Boards. The broader H3Africa consortium was faced
with similar issues, and this ultimately led to sponsored invitations to Head of
Ethics committees/IRBs to attend H3Africa meetings in order to voice their
concerns and engage in dialogue to mitigate any grievances. This process has
paid significant dividends - green-lighting projects that were on hold for some
time, and gaining a wider audience and appreciation for H3Africa protocols at
the University and Ministry levels. Finally, communication and data transfer
issues due to slow or absent internet connections continue to be a significant
problem without an obvious solution thus far. Genomics generates large amounts
of data, necessitating fast connections for analyses and data transfer; although
increased bandwidth and speed are a priority for many African governments,
progress on this front has been slow.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Dissemination of findings</title><p id="P69">The findings of the <italic>CAfGEN</italic> project will be disseminated

at the COEs and integrated genomics training in both Botswana and Uganda has
permitted us to pioneer a new method of undertaking genomics and biomedical research
in Africa whilst building sustainable expertise and infrastructure. This innovative
approach has registered significant gains in achieving the goal of H3Africa.
Furthermore, we have successfully ensured that the acquired genomics expertise is
transferred to Africa as trainees returned to their home countries to take faculty
positions, transfer skills and participate in genomics-driven research pertinent to
African populations with a goal of improving health.</p><p id="P72">
<italic>CAfGEN</italic> will continue to work hand in hand with the African
academia, funding agencies, and governments to promote genomics training, research,
and support genomics policy formulation, in pursuit of its long-term goal of
becoming a major centre for large-scale genomic studies of paediatric HIV and
associated co-morbidities in sub-Saharan Africa.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="S19"><title>Data availability</title><p id="P73">All data underlying the results are available as part of the article and no

and describe how it operates, what the pertinent challenges are, and how it has gone
about community engagement. The paper illustrates that a well organised and funded
collaborative genomics project in Africa can, in a short period of time, achieve a
lot in terms of research capacity building. That is quite an encouraging and
important message in the manuscript.&#x000a0;</p><p id="P79"> Major Comments:</p><p id="P80"> In both the abstract and in the introduction, you first mention H3Africa
and then CafGEN, and we would suggest that you reverse that order. In doing that,
you&#x02019;ll give more prominence to your own work &#x02013; a small but important
change of focus. In the way you present your work, we think you should make it clear
that CafGEN derives legitimacy from the pertinent scientific questions in this
field, and not from H3Africa. H3Africa is the facilitator of CafGEN through funding,
network building, and infrastructure &#x02013; it is not the reason that CafGEN
exists though. <list list-type="bullet" id="L5"><list-item><p id="P81">In the same vein, it is not that interesting for an audience to
know that &#x02018;a call for applications was issued&#x02019;. Rather,
why don&#x02019;t you speak about the most important challenges in the
field of (paediatric) HIV/AIDS research that motivated you to set up
CafGEN? With a follow up section on how CafGEN will systematically
tackle those questions. <list list-type="bullet" id="L6"><list-item><p id="P82">So in short, what we would suggest is that you
review your entire first page of the manuscript, and cut out
much of the current text, and rather introduce the context
pertinent to CafGEN specifically. In a way, we would suggest
re-writing your text to demonstrate (rather than state) that
CafGEN is a &#x02018;unique, highly synergistic African
alliance&#x02019;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P83">One example of that is that it&#x02019;s only on pg 5
of the current manuscript that you introduce the three
Centers of Excellence that CafGEN work is premised on
&#x02013; but isn&#x02019;t the collective experience in those
centres (and a detailed understanding of the knowledge gaps
derived thereof) the backbone to the collaboration? If so,
then this should take centre stage in the article.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P84">In a way, we propose that the text on Pg 6 achieves
some of our suggestions above.</p></list-item></list>
</p></list-item></list> &#x000a0;</p><p id="P85"> Minor comments:</p><p id="P86"> 1. One of the 6 CAFGEN sites is the Swaziland Children&#x02019;s Clinical
Centres of Excellence (Page 4). But the article is silent on research and capacity
building activities in this country/site, except that the Swaziland COE was added
later on to boost the enrolment in the TB case-control component of the study (see
page 8). It therefore appears that much of the capacity building and research
activities took place in Uganda and Botswana and not Swaziland. Maybe the authors
can add a few sentences on the capacity building and research activities at this
site. If none, then maybe explain why that wasn&#x02019;t the case and the challenges
they had in implementing capacity building and research in Swaziland.</p><p id="P87"> 2. Page 4: I think the use of heart disease as an example of an inherited
disease may not be the best. Perhaps it is the way it is used in the sentence
&#x02013; we would encourage the authors to review this sentence and the example and
to perhaps to use another example or to reword the sentence.</p><p id="P88"> 3. Page 7. Consent forms where translated to Luganda and Setswana. Again,
information for the Lesotho site is missing, though there was participant enrolment
at the site. Please can you add information on consent, Recruitment/CE for the
Lesotho site or otherwise explain how this site fits in with the other sites.</p><p id="P89"> 4. Page 8. Community engagement activities:The CAFGEN comic series is
described as an innovative (maybe creative?) CE method (and we agree). The authors
can maybe add a sentence or two on why they consider it innovative and also a few
lines, in the discussion, on the advantages of this CE method for genomics research
in Africa. This will benefit readers who are not familiar with CE in health research
in Africa or the use of comics and social media for CE in health research in
Africa.</p><p id="P90"> The first community engagement activity -- classroom training for health
care workers may fit better in the section on &#x0201c;Capacity building and
infrastructure development&#x0201d;. This is perhaps more an activity concerning
training in research ethics for health care workers than a community engagement
activity?</p><p id="P91">We have read this submission. We believe that we have an appropriate level
of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="REPORT26342" article-type="peer-review"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>Referee response for version 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hollox</surname><given-names>Edward J</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="A19">1</xref><role>Referee</role><contrib-id contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0115-2298</contrib-id></contrib><aff id="A19">

Genomics Network (CAfGEN), with a focus on the training on a cohort of African
genomics researchers, as well as investigating the host genetic factors that
influence progression of HIV and HIV-tuberculosis co-infection in sub-Saharan
Africa.</p><p id="P94"> This is a very useful document that describes the development of CafGEN,
and provides information to other African genomics partnerships in approaches to
build a collaboration that includes training and research. In particular, it
highlights infrastructure and community engagement approaches, and identifies
roadblocks to this, and potentially other, capacity-building programmes.</p><p id="P95"> I only have a few minor suggestions that would improve the manuscript.
<list list-type="order" id="L7"><list-item><p id="P96">Page 4, paragraph 2. &#x0201c;Key to this, is
identifying&#x0201d;. No comma needed.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P97">Page 4, paragraph 2. &#x0201c;relatively straightforward
variation in a single gene&#x0201d;. This sentence needs to be clarified,
reworded, and perhaps this point should be expanded. Sickle cell disease
is, as the authors will know, caused by a single variant in a single
gene, there are other genetic disease that are caused by different
variants in a single gene, and the complexity increases in a continuum
to complex multifactorial disease. The sentence seems to suggest that it
is either a single gene disease, or a complex disease. It also seems to
suggest that heart disease is an inherited disease &#x000a0;&#x02013;
I&#x02019;m sure this was not the intention of the authors but the
sentence can be read this way.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P98">Page 4, paragraph 3. &#x0201c;&#x02026; DNA variation both
directly and indirectly impacts disease outcomes&#x0201d;. The previous
paragraph discusses how DNA variation can directly affect disease
outcomes, but the authors need to be more explicit how DNA variation
indirectly affects disease outcomes.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P99">Page 4, column 2, paragraph 1. &#x0201c;classically considered to
be the wellspring of modern humanity&#x0201d;. This sentence is vague and
should be rewritten. In particular, reconsider the use of the term
&#x0201c;classically&#x0201d; as I don&#x02019;t think this is the case,
and try to avoid the circularity in this sentence &#x02013; evidence for
Africa being the origin of modern humans comes from the observed high
levels of genetic diversity, while this sentence seems to suggest the
inference is the other way around.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P100">Page 4, column 2, paragraph 2. &#x0201c;After&#x0201d; is clearer
than &#x0201c;Subsequent to&#x0201d;.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P101">Page 6 column 1. It is not clear why some aims are split into 2
&#x02013; a and b. Either combine these to make five aims, or give them
different numbers to make 8 aims.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P102">Page 6, aim 2a. It is not clear why &#x0201c;established&#x0201d;
is in scare quotes. Do the authors mean that these loci are established
in Europeans but not Africans? The authors should clarify this.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P103">Page 7, paragraph 1. The second sentence is not clear.
I&#x02019;d suggest rewording: &#x0201c;The parent or legal guardian
provided written informed consent on behalf of participants who were
younger than the legal age of consent (18 years in Uganda and 21 years
in Botswana).&#x0201d;</p></list-item></list>

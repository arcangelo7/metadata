</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par24">We compared the three standard trauma scores, i.e., RTS, ISS, NISS, in the pediatric fall population and found that RTS was most sensitive to predict the inhospital mortality. This may be attributed to higher propensity of respiratory and neurological derangements seen frequently in pediatric patients in absence of anatomical injuries. It may be speculated that since ISS depends on anatomical injuries, a conservative approach for radiological investigations may miss substantial number of injuries and could lead to poor performance of ISS and NISS in the given cohort of pediatric fall. Previous studies has shown that vital signs like heart rate, respiratory rate, and GCS may be more accurate predictors for inhospital mortality than ISS and NISS and may depend on age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Similarly in adults, a multicentric study in India concluded that RTS is a better predictor of inpatient mortality than ISS and NISS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, performance of RTS in particular cohort of pediatric fall was lacking. The present study demonstrates the consistent superiority of RTS against ISS and NISS too. Among children, a smaller injury or fall may result in severe derangements and have adverse outcome due to their physiological vulnerability, immature immune system, and fragile structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. El-Gamasy et al. 2016 studied Pediatric Trauma Big Score as a predictive for mortality in pediatric polytraumatized patients and concluded that it has higher sensitivity and specificity than other trauma scores (PTS and NISS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Limitation</title><p id="Par25">This study is limited to the patients admitted in one of the tertiary trauma level 1 trauma center in Delhi. It is a secondary analysis of prospectively collected dataset; hence, pediatric trauma score could not be compared to RTS, ISS, and NISS since the variables needed to compute were not available. Therefore, the question whether PTS or RTS is a better predictor for inhospital mortality in pediatric fall cohort could not be answered in the present study. The study could not calculate Pediatric Big Score due to lack of required variable in the data base.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par26">To conclude, physiologically based trauma score systems (RTS) are much better predictors of inhospital mortality in comparison to anatomical based scoring systems (ISS, NISS) for unintentional pediatric falls. Fall constitutes major mechanism of unintentional injury to pediatric cohort. An identification of more precise tool may help clinician to better identify the patients at risk of worse outcome at an early stages and could lead to institutions of prophylactic measures.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Prof. Nobhojit Roy (principle investigator of the multicentric study: Towards Improved Trauma Care Outcomes&#x000a0;(TITCO) for his overall support of the project and the current study.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par27">None.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par28">Yes.

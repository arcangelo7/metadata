</p><p>The perspective of the integrated health system has a network of care with multiple
integration dimensions (systemic integration) among subsystems as nuclear
representation, relating the clinical aspects and governance to the representations and
collective values<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>
<fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Integrated Health Care Networks for Congenital Heart Disease Patients.
Adapted from Hartz &#x00026; Contandriopoulos<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> and Mendes<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-31-03-0256-g01"/></fig>
</p><p>The systemic integration is intensified in the coherence of integrational modalities in
all levels (organization, territory, region, states, etc.), and we understand that a
clinical project that responds to the complexity and uncertainty of health problems can
result not only of relations among organizations and professionals, local relationships
impacting on other levels and instances of political decision-making<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The public policy formulation has its starting point in society demand, since it goes the
political route and is legitimized by the revelation of needs and inequities. Similarly,
the executive power can directly influence and create an appropriate environment for the
written norms, and the more participatory, lower the risk of distortions in its
deliberations. No less important than discuss the justifications and methodology of its
implementation is to set goals and metrics for evaluation. Setting goals in light of
social needs and political and economic reality is a negotiation exercise whose outcome
must meet the principles as equity and integrity, which are in the guidelines of the
Unified Health System (SUS), even not experienced in its completeness.</p><p>In this thread, the society acquires the condition and the capacity to share with other
agents the political control, thus, providing the responsibility to maintain, adapt and
expand its scope.</p><p>Consequently, the society starts to communicate with the system through an integration
and control link.</p><p>The sensitization of the political environment moves towards influencing the decisions of
the executive power, and, thus, enables continuity of the agreed actions, which should
be more of a monitoring agent of the results. Even at the strategic level, the executive
power, with its bureaucratic status, are entitled to format the normative content by
bringing the knowledge of the SUS guidelines, conducting health actions. In this
environment, the budget is allocated to all stages of the policies; however, the
idealized amount is not accompanied by sufficient financial resources to solve the
problems, which is explained by the lack of knowledge on the project size or the
deliberate restriction of the budget to health. Anyhow, the financial failure will
impact over the implementation of the policy and determine its degree of
effectiveness.</p><p>The normative integration aims to ensure coherence between the system of representations
and values of society simultaneously with the interfaces of clinical and functional
integration<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>It builds a bridge with governance, which allows, through their skills, management of all
system components, encouraging cooperation, communication and information, in order to
ensure the population under their responsibility to access excellence services,
exceeding their expectations.</p><p>Due to the complexity surrounding the governance, another organizational level
(structural) was instituted beyond the tactical level, formed by financial and
administrative environments, structural, in order to give expression to vital sectors in
the development, maintenance and results of care networks. This organizational level is
composed by logistics and information technology. The interface among these
environments, functional integration, ensures a common coordination, guided by a system
of agile and flexible information with ability to make decisions about responsibility,
attributions and financial resources.</p><p>The logistics systems are technological solutions, strongly anchored in information
technology, and linked to the concept of vertical integration. It consists in the
realization of an effective system of reference and counter-reference of people and
efficient exchange of goods and information over the health care and support
systems<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Another structural pillar in the integrated care networks in the governance environment,
the information technology, had a significant development in recent decades and is a
functional support, whether strategic or operational, of the providers of health care
organizations. Its application extends quickness in providing information and sharing
knowledge, enabling effective and agile decisions, as well as better coordination among
entities. It also requires further information and capacity to handle problems related
to confidential information<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The governance interface, responsible for tactical and structural actions, and
operational and clinical level, is done by clinical integration, which is based on
management strategies, finance, logistics and information in an effort to provide the
clinical practice of multidisciplinary skills with a view to providing comprehensive
care to a given population.</p><p>The integration of care consists of a durable coordination of clinical practices for
those who suffer from health problems in order to ensure continuity and full range of
the required professional services and organizations, coordinated in time and space, in
accordance with the available knowledge. The integration of clinical teams has as main
attributes the multidisciplinary constitution of its members and its structural and
participatory inclusion in the care network<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Basic content of health care networks emerge from this definition: denote mission and
common objectives; operate cooperatively and interdependently; constantly interchange
their resources; are established without hierarchy among components, organize themselves
in a polyarchic way in which all health care points are equally important; imply a
continuum of care in primary, secondary and tertiary levels; call for a comprehensive
care with promotional, preventive, curative, caregivers, rehabilitative and palliative
interventions; work under the coordination of primary health care; provide timely care
in appropriate moments and places, offer safe and effective services in line with the
available evidence; focus on the full cycle of care to a health condition; have clear
health and economic responsibilities for its population; and produce a value for its
population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>
<fig id="f2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Integration of care. Attributes of primary, secondary and tertiary care
levels.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-31-03-0256-g02"/></fig>
</p><p>The first point of care is the primary care, which can be understood as defined in the
Alma Ata Conference, in 1978:</p><p><disp-quote><p>"[...] essential health care based on practical technologies, scientifically
reasoned and socially acceptable, made universally accessible to individuals and
families in the community through their full participation and at a cost that
the community and country can maintain at every stage of their development, in
the spirit of self-reliance and selfdetermination. It is the first level of
contact of individuals, family and community with the national health system,
whereby health care are taken as close as possible to where people live and
work, and constitutes the first element of a continuing health care
process"<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.</p></disp-quote></p><p>The other components of health care networks are the points of secondary and tertiary
care, the network nodes where they offer certain specialized services produced by a
unique production function. They are distinguished by their respective technology
densities, and tertiary points are technologically denser than the secondary points and,
therefore, tend to be more spatially concentrated<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>It is possible to establish the type of health equipment for each level of care for
patients with congenital heart diseases. This strategy intends to offer timely care in
appropriate moments and places, efficiently, operating cooperatively an
interdependently, with ongoing exchange of its resources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>
<fig id="f3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Competencies of health care levels for patients with congenital heart
disease.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-31-03-0256-g03"/></fig>
</p><p>The integration of clinical care in the primary, secondary and tertiary care dimensions
is linked to the concept of vertical integration, which refers to the combination,
within the same organization or an interorganizational alliance, previously independent
production units, but whose products are input from one unit to another<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure
2</xref>).</p><p>By the same measure, Santana &#x00026; Costa<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>, compiling definitions, say that vertical integration is the
creation of a single management entity of two or more entities that provide services in
levels of care in order to improve the overall health status of a population in a
certain geo-demographic regional context. For the WHO<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>, vertical integration considers the aggregation of
inputs, provision and service management related to the prevention, promotion,
diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation of health. It is a synonymous term with the
services related to access, quality, user satisfaction and efficiency.</p><p>The motivating factors to overcome the fragmentation of health care systems are the lower
transaction costs in the system and increased productivity for optimal use of common
resources.</p><p>In customer perceptiveness asymmetrically informed in the face of supply agent in a
disease situation, there is no perception and consecutively the capacity of decision to
opt for health care consumption that offers varying levels of care. According to
Costa<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>, the division between
primary and secondary health care essentially corresponds to a preferred provider, since
the perception of the consumer is focused on health care, unaware if it suffers from a
problem of 'primary' or 'secondary' nature.</p><p>In this way, you can determine for each unit providing clinical care in the various
levels of care, which services are made available to the user, observing concepts of
vertical integration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>
<fig id="f4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Competencies of clinical care units, related to care for patients with
congenital heart disease.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-31-03-0256-g04"/></fig>
</p><p>In this context, territorial integration emerges, which enables the system to establish
the health needs of a specific population, under its responsibility, according to the
risks, and implement and evaluate sanitary interventions for this population and to
provide care for people in the context of their culture and their preferences<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Planning processes, organization, management and financing of health policy must be based
on knowledge of the regional reality historically constituted and expressed in updated
indicators of demographic, socioeconomic, political, epidemiological and sanitary
nature, in other words, specific spaces and population. Such information and indicators
should be organized and articulated in models to establish causal relationships able to
guide and support the action of the State in effective policies for intervention in
reality<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The knowledge of the regional reality depends on the recognition of professional and
equipment deficits able to offer specialized care to specific population segment.
Therefore, it is priority to establish a formal system of allocation of resources with
appropriate geographical distribution of health facilities, human resources and programs
so that professional activities cover the entire spectrum of comprehensive, primary,
secondary, tertiary and long-term cares, with all agreements, connections and reference
needed, mechanisms established to integrate various levels and institutions in a
coherent and capable group to meet all patients' needs, within a defined
population-based scenario<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In conclusion, situational integration establishes the system connection with the
assessment environment that proposes to carry out value judgment, guided by an objective
worldview, about an intervention or any of its components, in order to objectify the
decision making. Agents must be willing to reevaluate their logics, interests and
specific cultures to accept the proposed objectives, the method of work in pursuit of
common goals, more ambitious than the sectored and welfare ones<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>.</p><p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="15%" span="1"/><col width="85%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1"><bold>Authors' roles &#x00026;

Abdominal ultrasonography revealed pregnancy of 28 weeks&#x02019; gestation. Computed
tomography demonstrated a type A aortic dissection. Because of progressive fetal
deterioration, an emergency cesarean section was forced to perform. The next
day, simple hysterectomy followed by an aortic procedure was completed.
Valve-sparing aortic replacement and total arch replacement were employed as
central operations. The mother and baby are well 9 months postoperatively.
Although the strategy for acute type A aortic dissection during pregnancy is
controversial, collaborations among neonatologists, obstetricians, and
cardiovascular surgeons can ensure mother and infant survival.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Aortic Valve</kwd><kwd>Cardiovascular Pregnancy Complications</kwd><kwd>Cardiovascular Surgical Procedures - Methods</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><table-wrap id="t1" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="5%" span="1"/><col width="95%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" style="background-color:#e6e7e8" rowspan="1">Abbreviations,

ambulance. She had an abdominal protuberance and abdominal ultrasonography revealed
that she was 28 weeks&#x02019; pregnant. Computed tomography (CT) was performed because she
had uncontrollable severe back pain with hypertension; her blood pressure was
256/141 mmHg.</p></sec><sec><title>Electrocardiography</title><p>Electrocardiography showed sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 83 beats/min, QRS axis
of +57&#x000b0;, PR interval of 0.16 seconds, and overload in the left ventricle.</p></sec><sec><title>Radiogram</title><p>Visceral <italic>situs solitus</italic> in levocardia was observed. There was also an
increased cardiac area with a cardiothoracic index of 0.60 and no enlargement of the
superior mediastinum.</p></sec><sec><title>Echocardiography</title><p>Echocardiography showed normal ejection fraction (EF=63%) and wall thickening of the
left ventricle. Aortic valve regurgitation, mitral valve regurgitation, and
pericardial effusion were not observed.</p></sec><sec><title>Diagnosis</title><p>CT revealed an acute aortic dissection (AAD), and the pelvic view showed a fetus
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). The size in diameter of
ascending, arch, and descending aorta were 33mm, 29mm, and 23mm respectively.
Antihypertensive therapy was immediately started after acute AAD was diagnosed.
Delivery was considered possible according to the stage of fetal development.
Therefore, we decided to perform an emergency cesarean section followed by surgery
for acute AAD to rescue the mother and fetus.</p><p>

</p></sec><sec><title>Operation</title><p>The emergency cesarean section was performed by obstetricians, with the patient under
general anesthesia. The baby, weighing 756 g, was intubated immediately after
delivery and transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit. On the next day of the
cesarean section, advanced hysterectomy was conducted because there was a risk of
major atonic bleeding uterus during aortic surgery. Median sternotomy was performed,
and cardiopulmonary bypass was established through the right axillary artery, right
femoral artery, and superior and inferior vena cava. After cardiac arrest, the
ascending aorta was cut open. An intimal tear developed from just above the
non-right commissure to beside the right coronary artery ostium. As the dissection
extended to the aortic root, valve sparing aortic root replacement (the
reimplantation procedure) and total arch replacement with frozen elephant trunk were
performed.</p><p>Histopathological analysis showed no evidence of connective tissue disease.
Postoperative CT demonstrated resolved AAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure
2</xref>). The mother and baby were doing well 9 months postoperatively.</p><p>

</p><p>Acute AAD during pregnancy has been reported<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Acute AAD during
pregnancy endangers the lives of both the mother and fetus. The treatment strategies
for acute AAD during pregnancy are controversial. Treatment strategies are
considered to include the following: aortic surgery after cesarean section, delivery
after aortic surgery, and simultaneous cesarean section and aortic surgery. In
situations wherein the fetus can endure delivery and the mother&#x02019;s acute AAD is
stable, a staged aortic surgery after cesarean section is possible. However, when
acute AAD is unstable, there is no choice but to perform cesarean section and aortic
surgery simultaneously. If fetal development is inadequate, aortic surgery must be
performed before delivery.</p><p>It has been reported that the natural mortality of infants with extremely low birth
weight during their neonatal intensive care unit stay is 8.3% at more than 28 weeks&#x02019;
gestation. The mortality according to birth weight was less than 12% in infants
weighing over 700 g<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. In our
case, the possibility of delivery was increased when the fetus was more than 28
weeks of gestation and weighed over 700 g.</p><p>Although the strategy for acute AAD during pregnancy is still controversial, our
strategy for the present case saved the mother and baby.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="5%" span="1"/><col width="95%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">YK</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Substantial contributions to the

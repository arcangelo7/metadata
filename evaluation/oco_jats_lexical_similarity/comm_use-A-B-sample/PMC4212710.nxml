We compared responses to bacterial virulence factors in primary human nasal and alveolar cells, and characterised the distribution of Toll-interacting protein (TOLLIP; an inhibitor of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling) in the human respiratory tract.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Primary cells were isolated from nasal brushings and lung tissue taken from patients undergoing pulmonary resection. Cells were exposed to lipopolysaccharide, lipoteichoic acid, peptidoglycan, CpG-C DNA or tumour necrosis factor (TNF). Cytokines were measured in cell supernatants. TOLLIP was characterised using quantitative real-time PCR and immunofluorescence.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In primary alveolar, but not primary nasal, cells peptidoglycan significantly increased secretion of interleukin (IL)-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF. TLR2 expression was significantly higher in alveolar cells and correlated with IL-8 production. TOLLIP expression was significantly greater in nasal cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, primary human alveolar epithelial cells are significantly more responsive to peptidoglycan than primary nasal epithelial cells. This may partly be explained by differential TLR2 expression. TOLLIP is expressed widely in the human respiratory tract, and may contribute to the regulation of inflammatory responses.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Innate Immunity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float"><caption><title>Key messages</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Peptidoglycan exerts a significant proinflammatory cytokine response in primary human alveolar epithelium but not in primary human nasal epithelium.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The Toll-like receptor regulator Toll-interacting protein is widely expressed in the human respiratory tract.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) are common and associated with significant morbidity and mortality.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Pneumonia is associated with the highest mortality among the HAIs.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>

Similarly to the response of primary nasal cells, TNF-mediated stimulation induced significant elevations in secretion of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 from alveolar cells, suggesting no major differences in signalling downstream of the TNF receptor between these two cell types.</p><table-wrap id="BMJRESP2014000046TB2" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Constitutive and stimulated cytokine production by primary type II alveolar epithelial cells</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">&#x000a0;<hr/></th><th align="left" colspan="5" rowspan="1">Stimulant<hr/></th></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Basal</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic><break/>PGN</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>S. aureus</italic> LTA</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic><break/>LPS</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CpG</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TNF</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">IL-1&#x003b2; (pg/mL)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>5</italic><break/>2.5&#x02013;8</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>17.2</italic>&#x02005;**<break/>5&#x02013;152</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>3.4</italic><break/>1.6&#x02013;12.5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>6.3</italic><break/>2.2&#x02013;14</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>7.5</italic><break/>1.7&#x02013;11</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>11</italic><break/>1.2&#x02013;85.3</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">IL-6 (pg/mL)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>236</italic><break/>8.3&#x02013;1276</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>927</italic>&#x02005;*<break/>121&#x02013;9060</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>333</italic><break/>7.6&#x02013;716</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>214</italic><break/>8.2&#x02013;533</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>228</italic><break/>12.6&#x02013;803</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>1205</italic>&#x02005;<bold>**</bold><break/>34.1&#x02013;4029</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">IL-8 (pg/mL)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>2273</italic><break/>707&#x02013;11&#x02005;226</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>7444</italic>&#x02005;*<break/>1283&#x02013;100&#x02005;000</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>2002</italic><break/>843&#x02013;21&#x02005;914</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>1507</italic><break/>649&#x02013;13&#x02005;548</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>2919</italic><break/>636&#x02013;40&#x02005;775</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>31&#x02005;721</italic>&#x02005;***<break/>9450&#x02013;78&#x02005;198</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">IL-10 (pg/mL)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>15</italic><break/>2.6&#x02013;1276</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>25.4</italic>&#x02005;**<break/>3.5&#x02013;5000</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>23.2</italic><break/>3.6&#x02013;716</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>19.2</italic><break/>3&#x02013;504</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>20.2</italic><break/>0&#x02013;803</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>26</italic>&#x02005;*<break/>3.5&#x02013;4029</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">IL-12 (pg/mL)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>8</italic><break/>5.4&#x02013;19.7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>7.3</italic><break/>6.6&#x02013;31.2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>8.3</italic><break/>4.9&#x02013;30</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>12.7</italic><break/>3.5&#x02013;25</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>12.0</italic><break/>2.7&#x02013;28.6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>7</italic><break/>2.7&#x02013;30.3</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">TNF (pg/mL)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>10</italic><break/>3.6&#x02013;21.2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>29</italic>&#x02005;*<break/>6.5&#x02013;279</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>5</italic><break/>0&#x02013;21.4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>12</italic><break/>2.3&#x02013;26.7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>7.0</italic><break/>0&#x02013;15.7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02020;</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Data are expressed as median (upper line, italic) and range (lower line, normal text). n=7 for all conditions.

This responsiveness to TNF is consistent with findings elsewhere.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Other studies have suggested that primary human nasal epithelial cells have a relatively restricted nasal cytokine responsiveness to stimulation, broadly in keeping with findings here.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> However, unlike our results, both these studies found responsiveness of IL-8 to a variety of stimuli, while a further study found that both IL-6 and IL-8 were increased in response to LPS.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>In contrast to the relative quiescence of primary nasal cells, we found that primary alveolar epithelial cells were characterised by a more florid response to PGN and TNF that spanned a wider range of cytokines. These observations appear consistent with the hypothesis that bacterial virulence factors are better tolerated by the nose. Our data suggest that <italic>S. aureus</italic> PGN induces a particularly florid inflammatory response in alveolar epithelial cells. It may be particularly relevant that, in our hands, the levels of expression of TLR2 (which recognises PGN) correlated closely with responsiveness, as assessed by IL-8 secretion. The implication seems to be not only that alveolar epithelium expresses more &#x02018;target&#x02019; for PGN, but that PGN can upregulate TLR2 expression more effectively on alveolar epithelium. This may go some way to explaining the differential responsiveness of nasal and alveolar epithelium, and perhaps why the lung mounts such a striking inflammatory response to <italic>S. aureus</italic>, a common &#x02018;coloniser&#x02019; of the human nose.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> It is far less clear why PGN produced a proinflammatory response in our alveolar epithelial cells while LTA and LPS did not. In the case of LPS, the lack of responsiveness could not be attributed to an absence of appropriate receptors, as TLR4 is well described on alveolar epithelial cells, and other groups have described LPS responsiveness in alveolar epithelium.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The apparently selective and florid response of alveolar cells to PGN in our hands is intriguing. It is tempting to speculate that membrane-based TLR regulators may recognise different virulence factors preferentially, and/or that PGN effects intracellular TLR regulators in a different way from other virulence factors in primary alveolar epithelial cells. However, this must remain purely speculative until further data are available.</p><p>To investigate further potential reasons for differential innate immune responsiveness between the nose and lung, we drew on data describing an excess of TOLLIP in the large intestine, where bacterial tolerance is essential. We believe this to be the first systematic characterisation of TOLLIP's presence and location in primary cells from the human respiratory tract. TOLLIP has been cloned from a human lung cDNA library,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and expression has been described in pooled human lung tissue,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> but the purpose of those studies did not include cellular localisation. <italic>TOLLIP</italic> mRNA and TOLLIP protein have been detected in commercially available human small airway epithelial cells.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<italic>TOLLIP</italic> mRNA has also been described in pleural effusions.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Our findings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJRESP2014000046F3">figure 3</xref> complement those in small airway epithelial cells by suggesting that TOLLIP is produced throughout the length of the human respiratory tract. These observations are at variance with our initial hypothesis. However, the finding of higher <italic>TOLLIP</italic> mRNA expression in primary nasal epithelial cells in comparison to type II alveolar epithelial cells broadly supports the hypothesis. The observation that TOLLIP is constitutively and ubiquitously expressed in human respiratory epithelium is consistent with a potential role as a key regulator of inflammatory responses.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> However, we must stress that we found no evidence for differential <italic>TOLLIP</italic> responsiveness to bacterial virulence factors in nasal and alveolar cell lines.</p><p>TOLLIP binds to IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK-1), preventing proinflammatory signalling. On stimulation of cells with LPS or IL-1, a receptor complex rapidly forms, incorporating TOLLIP bound to IRAK-1. Sufficient phosphorylation of IRAK-1 allows its dissociation from TOLLIP, and proinflammatory signalling (for example, through nuclear factor &#x003ba; B) rapidly ensues. TOLLIP is therefore well placed to regulate inflammatory processes. TOLLIP's ready availability in organs regularly exposed to bacteria, such as the gut, nose and lung, seems potentially important in this regard. Interestingly, TOLLIP has been implicated in LPS hyporesponsiveness in human monocytes and human primary intestinal epithelial cells.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>The functional importance of TOLLIP as a regulator of acute inflammation is supported by emerging clinical data. For example, in the Chinese Han population, increased susceptibility to sepsis is conferred by polymorphisms in the <italic>TOLLIP</italic> gene that result in reduced TOLLIP function.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Similarly, functional polymorphisms in a Vietnamese population have been associated with susceptibility to tuberculosis.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In a Caucasian population, <italic>TOLLIP</italic> gene polymorphisms have been weakly associated with increased susceptibility to atopic dermatitis.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Observational data suggest that <italic>TOLLIP</italic> expression is reduced in tissue from coeliac disease and necrotising enterocolitis.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>While the data here are some way from having direct clinical relevance, validation of a florid alveolar response to PGN in other cohorts might yield avenues for further exploration. In particular, selective administration of anti-TLR2 or specific TLR regulators early in the florid proinflammatory phase of staphylococcal pneumonia seems theoretically attractive in a condition with continued high mortality despite modern antibiotics and supportive care. The association between TLR2 expression and IL-8 secretion in unstimulated and PGN-stimulated cells is potentially relevant in this regard.</p><p>Comparison of responses in primary human cells increases the relevance of this study. However, we recognise that there are several potential limitations. First, all of our patients had cancer and most had a long history of smoking, which is known to affect cytokine secretion by epithelial cells throughout the respiratory tract.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> We cannot exclude the possibility that smoking or systemic effects of patients&#x02019; illness may have altered cytokine production or cellular responsiveness. Second, numbers of patients were small, reflecting low availability and technical issues in obtaining cells. While recognising this limitation, we felt that studying primary human cells would be by far the most relevant way to advance this area. Furthermore, consistent effects in studies of this nature help to generate hypotheses for further investigation. Third, as in any model system, we obviously cannot be certain that isolated, cultured epithelial cells behave as they would in their complex native environment. Finally, while epithelial cells are numerically dominant in the nose and alveoli, we cannot exclude the possibility that our stimuli might induce effects in other, less well-represented cells in these regions. Furthermore, in rodents it has been suggested that type I alveolar epithelial cells (notoriously hard to isolate from humans) respond more floridly to inflammatory stimuli than do type II cells.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>In summary, primary human alveolar epithelial cells appear to mount a more exuberant inflammatory response to PGN and TNF than do primary human nasal epithelial cells. PGN's effects may relate to the relative abundance and regulation of TLR2 in the upper and lower airway. TOLLIP is produced throughout the human respiratory tract. TOLLIP is expressed in greater levels in nasal cells than in alveolar epithelial cells, but differential TOLLIP expression in nasal and lung cells in response to bacterial virulence factors was not observed. These data suggest that relative expression of TLR2 and TOLLIP might play a role in the tolerant nature of the nasal epithelium to bacteria. Further studies are required to address a range of remaining questions&#x02014;these include, but are by no means limited to: whether other TLR regulators are differentially expressed (constitutively or inducibly) in nasal versus alveolar epithelium; whether bacterial virulence factors differentially influence TLR regulator expression within alveolar epithelial cells (favouring a proinflammatory effect of PGN but not the other virulence factors measured here) and whether PGN can evade membrane-based TLR regulators on alveolar cells.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to Professor Ian Poxton, University of Edinburgh, for providing ultrapure LPS, and to Dr Peter Barlow, Napier University, Edinburgh, for advice in performing experiments.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> OLM-N designed the study, obtained clinical samples, performed experiments, analysed data and wrote the paper.

Its prevalence
increases with age. The main risk factors are age older than 65 years, male gender
and smoking history<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. As the
aneurysm size increases, there is the risk of rupture<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Although some patients may present vague symptoms
such as abdominal or back pain, the majority of aneurysms remain asymptomatic until
rupture<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>, which has a
mortality rate about 85%<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. The
goal of treatment is to exclude the aneurysm before rupture occurs<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Treatment by open repair (OR) is practiced since 1951. In the 90s, endovascular
aneurysm repair (EVAR) was introduced as a less invasive method<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>, originally developed for patients
considered ineligible for OR<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.
Its introduction aimed to improve the care provided to the patient offering a
therapeutic possibility with less surgical aggression initially without thinking
that could compete with OR. Older patients with major comorbidities previously
excluded from treatment have become candidates for EVAR allowing a reduction in the
number of patients without conditions for treatment over the years. But the
selection of the treatment method to each patient is not always clear and is based
on the results of randomized studies, national/international series and individual
choice based on surgeon's opinion, considering patient clinical risk and aneurysm
features.</p><p>There is strong evidence of OR's durability, but there are few long-term results for
EVAR. So, there is still an uncertainty concerning EVAR's durability and its overall
long-term efficacy when compared to OR<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. This lack of knowledge about the future behavior implies a
greater need for clinical and imaging surveillance which could represent higher
costs.</p><p>Several studies compared EVAR to OR particularly regarding the perioperative and
long-term mortality, re-intervention rates and cost-effectiveness, sometimes with
diverging results.</p><p>The Clinical Practice Guidelines of the European Society of Vascular Surgery suggest
that vascular surgical referral centers must have an operative mortality for
elective OR less than 5% and for EVAR less than 2%<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Having regard to selection of the best treatment to be used for each patient and
knowing that these treatment methods are complementary and not competitive, the
purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of EVAR's incorporation in the
treatment of infra-renal AAA in our institution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>A retrospective study of the patients with the diagnostic of infra-renal AAA treated
in our institution between December 2001 and December 2013 was performed. Patients
with the diagnosis of infra-renal AAA with diameter equal or superior to 5cm and
patients with infra-renal AAA with diameter inferior to 5cm but with iliac aneurysms
with diameter equal or superior to 3cm were included in our study.</p><p>The choice between EVAR and OR was individualized for each patient, based on
surgeons' opinion, considering patient clinical risk and aneurysm's anatomical
features.</p><p>During this period, a total of 292 patients were treated in our institution with the
diagnostic of infra-renal AAA, 171 (58.6%) by EVAR and 121 (41.4%) by OR.</p><p>We analyzed the group of patients treated by EVAR and by OR and, for each group, we
studied patient's and aneurysm's characteristics, surgical and anesthesia average
times, need for blood transfusion, intraoperative complications, mean hospital stay,
re-intervention rates (within 30 days and after), mortality rate (during
hospitalization and within 30 days) and survival curves. We studied costs associated
to EVAR and to OR and the relation between costs and age and costs and American
Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification.</p><p>The mean follow-up time was 32.4 months. The follow-up was performed with
computerized tomography (CT) in the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup> month after
treatment and then yearly or every time it seems clinically relevant.</p><p>The statistical method used evaluates the normal distribution of the continuous
variables using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The comparison between two groups of
patients was based on Student's <italic>t</italic> test for variables that
approximately followed a normal distribution and the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test in
the event that the assumptions of normality or equality of variances were not
observed. Comparison of more than two groups was based on analysis of variance and
the Kruskal-Wallis test, when the assumptions of normality and homogeneity of
variances were absent.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The mean age was 74.1&#x000b1;8.9 years in the EVAR group and 69.6&#x000b1;8.7 years in
the OR group, this variable proved to have statistical relevance
(<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). The treatment performed according to the age group
was also studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). In this sense, the
patients were divided into three groups: with age up to 70 years, between 70 and 80
years and above 80 years. For each group, respectively, the treatment was EVAR in
31.6%, 38.6%, 29.8% and OR in 47.1%, 43%, 9.9%. A statistically significant
relationship was observed (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) with the younger group most
often treated by OR and the older one most often by EVAR.</p><p>
<fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig.1</label><caption><p>Distribution of the type of treatment according to age group.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-31-02-0098-g01"/></fig>
</p><p>In relation to gender, 94.2% of patients in the EVAR group were male and 5.8% were
female. In OR group, 95% were male and 5% were female. There was no relationship
with statistical significance among variables (<italic>P</italic>=0.478).</p><p>Regarding the presence of aortic atherosclerotic disease risk factors we studied
hypertension, diabetes <italic>mellitus</italic>, dyslipidemia, cerebrovascular
disease, peripheral arterial disease and active/non-active smoking. No statistically
significant relationship was observed for high blood pressure (84.2% in the EVAR
group <italic>vs.</italic> 87% in the OR group, <italic>P</italic>=0.610),
non-active smoking (58.8% in EVAR <italic>vs.</italic> 57% in OR;
<italic>P</italic>=0.807), dyslipidemia (67.6% in EVAR <italic>vs.</italic> 61.4% in
OR, <italic>P</italic>=0.134), diabetes mellitus (18.2% in EVAR <italic>vs.</italic>
11.4% in OR, <italic>P</italic>=0.134) and peripheral arterial disease (18.2% in
EVAR <italic>vs.</italic> 19.3% in OR, <italic>P</italic>=0.877). A statistically
significant relationship was observed for active smoking (16.5% in EVAR
<italic>vs.</italic> 31.5% in OR, <italic>P</italic>=0.004) and for
cerebrovascular disease (19.4% in EVAR <italic>vs.</italic> 10.5% in OR,
<italic>P</italic>=0.048).</p><p>Associated diseases (heart, lung or kidney diseases) were studied for each group.
Regarding the presence of cardiac disease studied were higher in the EVAR group with
a statistically significant relationship with ischemic cardiac disease present in
53% of the patients in the EVAR group <italic>vs.</italic> 40.4% of those in OR
group (<italic>P</italic>=0.039), valvular disease present in 27% of those submitted
to EVAR <italic>vs.</italic> 4.4% of those in the OR group
(<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001), dysrhythmia present in 37.2% in the EVAR
<italic>vs.</italic> 12.4% in the OR group (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) and
cardiac insufficiency present in 45.1% of the patients in the EVAR group
<italic>vs.</italic> 20.2% in the OR group (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001).
Regarding pulmonary disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was
present in 24.1% of patients in the EVAR group and in 26.8% in the OR group, no
statistically significant relationship was observed (<italic>P</italic>=0.672) and
respiratory failure was present in 5.6% of the patients in the EVAR group
<italic>vs.</italic> 0.9% in the OR group, an almost statistically significant
relationship was observed (<italic>P</italic>=0.051). Regarding renal disease, a
statistically significant relationship was observed for the presence of chronic
renal insufficiency (21.3% of patients treated by EVAR <italic>vs.</italic> 8.8% in
OR, <italic>P</italic>=0.007) but wasn't observed for chronic renal insufficiency in
hemodialysis replacement therapy (1.8% of the patients in the EVAR
<italic>vs.</italic> 0 in the OR group, <italic>P</italic>=0.274) or chronic
renal insufficiency in kidney transplantation replacement therapy (2.5% of those in
the EVAR <italic>vs.</italic> 0.9% in the OR group, <italic>P</italic>=0.651).</p><p>As regards the ASA physical status classification our patients were in one of three
categories: ASA II (mild systemic disease), ASA III (severe systemic disease) or ASA
IV (systemic disease threatening life). The frequency was, respectively, 15.6%,
71.3% and 13.1% in the EVAR group and 30.3%, 62.4% and 7.3% in the OR group. A
statistically significant relationship was observed (<italic>P</italic>=0.001) with
patients classified as class II more commonly treated by OR and class IV by
EVAR.</p><p>Aneurysm characteristics were also studied. Regarding the anatomical type divided
into aortic, bilateral aorto-iliac, right aorto-iliac and left aorto-iliac this was
respectively 65.5%, 11.7%, 15.2% e 7.6% in the EVAR group and 80.2%, 9.0%, 8.1% e
2.7% in the OR group. A statistically significant relationship was observed
(<italic>P</italic>=0.045) with aortic aneurysms treated most commonly by OR and
aorto-iliac aneurysms (right and left) by EVAR.</p><p>Regarding the aneurysm etiology, divided into degenerative, inflammatory and other
etiology, was respectively 93.5%, 5.3% and 4.1% in the EVAR group and 97.3%, 2.7%
and 0 in the OR group, no statistically significant relationship was observed
(<italic>P</italic>=0.092). The aneurysm etiology was also studied dividing into
only two etiologies degenerative and inflammatory, which represent respectively
97.5% and 2.5% in the EVAR group <italic>vs</italic>. 97.3% and 2.7% in the OR
group, no statistically significant relationship was observed
(<italic>P</italic>=0.001).</p><p>Aneurysm morphology, divided into fusiform and saccular was respectively 94.7% and
5.3% in the EVAR group <italic>vs.</italic> 72.3% and 27.7% in the OR group, a
statistically significant relationship was observed (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001)
with saccular aneurysms most commonly treated by OR.</p><p>As regards the aneurysm diameter, it was 62.4&#x000b1;14.8 mm in the group treated by
EVAR and 64.8&#x000b1;15.7 mm in the OR group. No statistically significant
relationship (<italic>P</italic>=0.201) was observe.</p><p>Blood transfusion was needed in 23.1% in the EVAR group <italic>vs.</italic> 77.6% in
the OR group, a statistically significant relationship was observed between these
variables (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001).</p><p>The mean anesthesia time was 174.4&#x000b1;63.2 minutes in the EVAR group and
292.6&#x000b1;79.5 minutes in the OR group, a statistically significant relationship
was observed between these variables (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). The mean
surgical time was 102.7&#x000b1;48.4 minutes in the EVAR group and 190.1&#x000b1;61.5
minutes in the OR group, a statistically significant relationship was observed
between these variables (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001).</p><p>Regarding EVAR's intraoperatory complications, we considered endoleaks requiring
additional treatment, arterial dissection/thromboses or other situations that
require some additional intervention. In OR group, we considered vascular or
visceral damage. Intraoperative complications rate was 23.4% in the EVAR group and
14.4% in the OR group, a statistically significant relationship was observed
(<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). The overall rate of complications during
hospitalization was higher in the OR group (38% in the OR group <italic>vs.</italic>
10.8% for EVAR), with a statistically significant relationship
(<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001).</p><p>We analyzed the costs associated with an EVAR and OR procedures (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). The average cost in EVAR was 1.448,3&#x020ac;
higher in comparison to OR. When we studied the relation between costs and age
(<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>) and costs and ASA
classification (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3</xref>), no statistically
significant relation was observed regarding age, but for both groups a statistically
significant relation was observed between costs and ASA classification with patients
classified ASA IV or above implying a significant higher cost in EVAR and in OR.</p><table-wrap id="t1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Global costs.</p></caption><table frame="box" rules="all"><colgroup span="1"><col width="12,5%" span="1"/><col width="12,5%" span="1"/><col width="12,5%" span="1"/><col width="12,5%" span="1"/><col width="12,5%" span="1"/><col width="12,5%" span="1"/><col width="12,5%" span="1"/><col width="12,5%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr style="border-right:hidden;border-left:hidden"><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Median</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Std.

pertinent. After 30 days, re-intervention rate was 11.7% for EVAR and 10.6% for OR,

of patients treated by EVAR and by OR are different. Patients treated by EVAR are
generally older and with more associated diseases. To point out that when we studied
chronic renal insufficiency in replacement therapy we haven't observed any relation
probably due to the small number of patients treated. In fact only 3 patients on
hemodialysis were treated and all of them were treated by EVAR. Only 5 renal
transplant patients were treated, 4 by EVAR and 1 by OR. These observations are in
agreement with our results when we studied ASA classification. "The Dutch Randomised
Endovascular Aneurysm Management Trial", 2005, (DREAM trial) and the
"<italic>Anevrysme de l'aorte abdominale, Chirurgie versus
Endoprothese</italic>" (ACE trial) are two randomized studies that also studied ASA
classification in patients included (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t4">Table
4</xref>). In these studies, the majority of patients selected for treatment
belonged to class II of ASA classification (mild systemic disease). In contrast, the
majority of patients treated in our institution belong to class III (severe systemic
disease). Additionally, in DREAM trial there were no patients classified as class IV
and they represent only 1.3% of the patients treated, all of them by EVAR, in ACE
trial. It could be explained with the fact that in DREAM trial only patients
eligible for both treatments were included, this can eventually have conditioned
that some patients classified as ASA IV were considered not eligible for OR and so
not included in the trial. The ACE trial only included relatively good-risk patients
and all patients classified as ASA IV were treated by EVAR. These results reinforce
EVAR as an option for patients with ASA classification III or IV whom can now be
treated with less risk<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>.</p><table-wrap id="t4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>ASA classification of the patients treated.</p></caption><table frame="box" rules="all"><colgroup span="1"><col width="15%" span="1"/><col width="17%" span="1"/><col width="17%" span="1"/><col width="17%" span="1"/><col width="17%" span="1"/><col width="17%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr style="border-right:hidden;border-left:hidden"><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ASA I - Healthy Patient (%)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ASA II - Mild Systemic Disease (%)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ASA III - Severe Systemic Disease (%)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ASA IV - Systemic Disease Threatening Life (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr style="border-right:hidden;border-left:hidden"><td rowspan="2" align="left" colspan="1"> Our Institution</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">EVAR</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">-</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">71.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.1</td></tr><tr style="border-right:hidden;border-left:hidden"><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">OR</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">-</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">62.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.3</td></tr><tr style="border-right:hidden;border-left:hidden"><td rowspan="2" align="left" colspan="1"> DREAM trial</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">EVAR</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">69.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">-</td></tr><tr style="border-right:hidden;border-left:hidden"><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">OR</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">-</td></tr><tr style="border-right:hidden;border-left:hidden"><td rowspan="2" align="left" colspan="1"> ACE trial</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">EVAR</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">66.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.3</td></tr><tr style="border-right:hidden;border-left:hidden"><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">OR</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">59.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">32.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">-</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Regarding to gender, our results demonstrate the equal offer of both techniques to
both genders and point out the higher prevalence of the disease in male gender as
described in the literature.</p><p>When we studied the aneurysm's etiology (divided into degenerative, inflammatory and
others) no statistically significant relationship was observed but it should be
noted that all aneurysms classified as other etiologies were treated by EVAR. As for
aneurysm size measured by its diameter no differences were observed in both groups
proving that the therapeutic indication is independent of the technique used.</p><p>Regarding blood transfusion necessity we observed a clear advantage in the EVAR. We
observed almost a reversal in necessities with 76.4% in the EVAR group not requiring
transfusion <italic>vs.</italic> 77.6% in the OR group requiring blood transfusion.
At a time when the availability of blood is scarce this is of great importance. It
also opens a door for those who for religious reasons do not accept transfusion of
blood products.</p><p>As regards time consumption in the operating room and surgeon's time consumption
measured respectively by the duration of anesthesia and the surgery time there was a
clear advantage in the treatment by EVAR with reduction of both times. Relatively to
the overall hospital stay there was also a clear advantage in the EVAR group (6.6
days less than for OR). At a time when reducing inpatient bed is expected, EVAR can
be useful. The average cost in EVAR was 1.448,3&#x020ac; higher in comparison to OR. ASA
classification equal or higher than 4 was associated with higher costs in both
groups.</p><p>Prospective randomized trials as "The United Kingdom Endovascular Aneurysm Repair
Trial 1" (EVAR 1 trial), "Open <italic>versus</italic> Endovascular Repair Veterans
Affair Cooperative Study" (OVER trial) and the already cited ACE and DREAM trials
have also recognized a reduced in the need for transfusion, shorter surgical time
and shorter duration of hospitalization among patients treated by EVAR when compared
to those treated by open repair<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Regarding complications (intraoperative and during hospitalization) only the first
shows a tendency to be more numerous in the EVAR group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>). The overall rate of complications during
hospitalization was significantly higher in the OR group and we concluded that most
of these complications were medical and whose treatment was also medical. Actually
OR showed a rate of complications during hospitalization of 38%, but the rate of
re-interventions within 30 days was only 13.7% which points out that most of the
complications did not require re-intervention. In comparison, the EVAR had a lower
rate of complications during hospitalization (10.8%) and a lower rate of
re-interventions within 30 days (4.1%).</p><p>

</p><p>Regarding mortality, the use of both techniques allowed to reach a global mortality
during hospitalization of 2.7% (1.2% in the EVAR group and 5% in the OR group).
Although not statistically significant, the mortality difference of the two groups
tends to be significant (<italic>P</italic>=0.07). Considering that the EVAR group
has a greater clinical risk as we have already concluded, we can infer benefit in
terms of early mortality that this technique arrived. The <xref ref-type="table" rid="t5">Table 5</xref> shows the mortality rates obtained in our institution

The EVAR 1, DREAM and OVER trials were in agreement in getting an early benefit in
the perioperative mortality with EVAR but this benefit is lost during follow-up and
no differences exist between the two groups in the long-term treatment. In the EVAR
1 trial the authors consider that the loss of this initial benefit throughout the
study is at least in part, due to late endograft ruptures. The authors also believe
that EVAR is associated with a higher rate of graft complications, more
re-interventions and higher cost. A similar conclusion was presented in the DREAM
and ACE trials. In contrast, the OVER trial revealed no significant difference in
re-intervention rates in the both groups. In our institution the re-intervention
rate after 30 days was not significantly different between the two groups
corroborating the OVER trial and going against EVAR 1, DREAM and ACE trials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The selection of the treatment method to be used is not clear. At one extreme, we
have a young patient with low clinical and anatomic risk and a complex aneurysm
anatomy for which OR is the election. At the other extreme, we have an elderly
patient with high clinical/anatomical risk with good aneurysm anatomy and EVAR is
the election. But in most situations in clinical practice these characteristics are
mixed and hinder the decision.</p><p>Our study showed that the two groups have different clinical conditions that make a
comparison difficult. The EVAR group is a presents major clinical risk as
demonstrated and it can lead to increased mortality during follow-up of these
patients not necessarily related to its AAA.</p><p>Assessing the institutional impact of the EVAR's introduction in the treatment of
patients with infra-renal AAA, we conclude that this method allowed the achievement
of an overall during hospitalization mortality of 2.7% (1.2% for EVAR and 5% for
OR), allowing us to achieve the objectives set by the European Society of Vascular
Surgery which states that reference centers must have, for elective procedures, a
mortality rate lower than 2% for EVAR and less than 5% for OR. We also believe that
by offering EVAR for these patients with more comorbidities (that would eventually
be treated by OR if EVAR had not been introduced), we improved the results of OR
itself. We also concluded that age older than 80 years influences the survival curve
in the OR group and ASA classification equal or above 4 influences the survival
curve in the EVAR group.</p><p>Treatment by EVAR has been pointed out as having higher costs in part by the higher
rate of re-interventions and our study contradicted this aspect and reinforced the
confidence in a costcontainment strategy.</p><table-wrap id="t8" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="10%" span="1"/><col width="90%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1"><bold>Authors' roles &#x00026;

positively alters the clinical trajectory of heart failure. In an
experimental model, respiratory muscle training in rats with heart failure
has been shown to improve cardiopulmonary function through mechanisms yet to
be entirely elucidated.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective</title><p>The present report aimed to evaluate the respiratory muscle training effects
in diaphragm citrate synthase activity and hemodynamic function in rats with
heart failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Wistar rats were divided into four experimental groups: sedentary sham
(Sed-Sham, n=8), trained sham (RMT-Sham, n=8), sedentary heart failure
(Sed-HF, n=7) and trained heart failure (RMT-HF, n=7). The animals were
submitted to a RMT protocol performed 30 minutes a day, 5 days/week, for 6
weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In rats with heart failure, respiratory muscle training decreased pulmonary
congestion and right ventricular hypertrophy. Deleterious alterations in
left ventricular pressures, as well as left ventricular contractility and
relaxation, were assuaged by respiratory muscle training in heart failure
rats. Citrate synthase activity, which was significantly reduced in heart
failure rats, was preserved by respiratory muscle training. Additionally, a
negative correlation was found between citrate synthase and left ventricular
end diastolic pressure and positive correlation was found between citrate
synthase and left ventricular systolic pressure.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Respiratory muscle training produces beneficial adaptations in the
diaphragmatic musculature, which is linked to improvements in left
ventricular hemodynamics and blood pressure in heart failure rats. The
RMT-induced improvements in cardiac architecture and the oxidative capacity

skeletal muscle, which impairs cell aerobic metabolism, particularly during physical
exertion<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. The inability
of the heart to supply adequate amounts of blood to meet the metabolic needs of
peripheral tissues<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>, including
the diaphragm muscle, is likely a key pathophysiological mechanism of HF.</p><p>Previous studies using a HF model induced by myocardial infarction (MI) demonstrated
reduced contractility, tension and structural abnormalities in the diaphragmatic
musculature<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. From a
clinical perspective, patients with HF often present with inspiratory muscle
weakness<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> and peripheral
skeletal muscle dysfunction<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>,
which are important contributors to exercise intolerance and culminate in poor
prognosis<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. In addition, peripheral muscle abnormalities in
HF, such as impaired skeletal muscle energy metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction,
fiber-type transition and atrophy, play an important role in exercise
intolerance<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>, which seems
to be associated with the genesis of the pathophysiological mechanism. Alterations
in muscle energy metabolism related to mitochondrial dysfunction has been assessed
through measurement of citrate synthase (CS) activity, one of the first enzymes
participating in the citric acid cycle and cellular oxidative metabolism, also
reflecting mitochondrial content in muscle tissue<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In the experimental model of HF, we previously demonstrated that respiratory muscle
training (RMT) promoted improvements in cardiopulmonary function<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>; however, the potential effect of
RMT on metabolic adaptations in the diaphragm is not fully understood. To this end,
we conducted a RMT protocol in an experimental model of HF induced by MI in rats;
hemodynamic function and CS activity were assessed. Our hypothesis was that the
6-week RMT protocol in rats could increase diaphragm oxidative metabolism, assessed
by the CS activity measurement, leading to hemodynamic function improvement.</p><p>Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery has demonstrated good potential in
promoting benefits related to cardiovascular mortality<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. Evidence has demonstrated that preoperative RMT
reduced the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) and duration
of postoperative hospitalization in patients at high risk of developing a pulmonary
complication undergoing CABG surgery. We believe that the present study could
contribute to understand these potential mechanisms<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>All of the procedures outlined in this study were approved by the Ethics Research
Committee of the Universidade Federal de Ci&#x000ea;ncias da Sa&#x000fa;de de
Porto Alegre (UFCSPA) (protocol 712/08). Thirty-six male Wistar rats (200 to 250
g; 90 days of age) obtained from the Animal Breeding Unit of the UFCSPA were
housed under standard conditions (food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>,
12:12-h light-dark cycle; 22&#x000ba;C).</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec><title>Myocardial Infarction Surgery</title><p>The animals were anesthetized with xylazine (12 mg/kg i.p.) and ketamine (90
mg/kg i.p.), intubated and artificially ventilated. For MI, ligation of the
left coronary artery was performed, as well as sham operations as previously
described<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>. After the surgery, the rats received a single
injection of monofenew (0.05 ml/100 g) and gentamicin (0.05 ml/100 g).</p><p>Subsequently to MI or sham surgery, rats were followed for 4 weeks (time for
HF development)<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> and were allocated into
four experimental groups: sedentary sham rats (Sed-Sham; n=8), trained sham
rats (RMT-Sham; n=8), sedentary HF rats (Sed-HF; n=7), or trained HF rats
(RMT-HF; n=7).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RMT Protocol</title><p>Rats assigned to the RMT groups were submitted to a 5-day adaptation protocol, as
previously described. The RMT protocol began in the 5<sup>th</sup> week post-MI
or sham surgery. It comprised 30 min/day, 5 days/week, for 6 weeks. The progress
of the protocol was achieved by a progressive increase in load resistance, by
reducing the internal diameter of the hole through which the animal breathed.
During the first week of the training, the orifice at the inspiratory port was
set at an internal diameter of 0.8 mm and was progressively decreased, reaching
after 2 weeks of training a final internal diameter of 0.3 mm (maximal
resistance), as previously described<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. Bisschop et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> demonstrated
that, in this protocol, the inspiratory load imposed to animals trained was
equivalent to a resistance of 0.7 cmH<sub>2</sub>O/ml/s at flow rate of 5 ml/s
(with an internal diameter of 0.8 mm) and a resistance of 18.4
cmH<sub>2</sub>O/ml/s at a flow rate of 5 ml/s (with an internal diameter of 0.3
mm).</p></sec><sec><title>Cardiac Hemodynamic Evaluation</title><p>After the RMT (RMT groups) or control (sedentary groups) period, the rats were
placed general anesthesia as previously described and the arterial catheter
(PE-50, 0.5 mm ID, Biocorp) was inserted into the right carotid artery. A
strain-gauge pressure transducer (P23 Db, Gould Statham, USA) was used for
direct hemodynamic measurements. Signals were passed through a preamplifier
(Hewlett-Packard 8805, Puerto Rico) and were delivered to a microcomputer
equipped with an analog-to-digital converter board (CODAS, 1 kHz, Dataq
Instruments, USA). The arterial pressure was recorded first during a 5-min
period. Then, the catheter was positioned inside the left ventricle (LV), and
the pulse wave was monitored using the typical graphic registration of
ventricular pressure and recorded for 5 min. These data were used to determine
mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), left ventricular systolic
pressure (LVSP), left ventricular maximum change in pressure over time
(+dP/dt<sub>max</sub>), left ventricular minimum change in pressure over
time (-dP/dt<sub>max</sub>), and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure
(LVEDP)<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>MI and HF Characterization</title><p>All animals were sacrificed by anesthetic overdose (thiopental 80 mg/kg i.p.),
and the heart, lungs, liver, and diaphragm were removed and weighed. The right
ventricle (RV) and LV were dissected and weighed. LV was placed in 10%
formaldehyde for a minimum of 3 days before being cut into two equal transverse
sections. These sections were embedded in paraf?n for subsequent analysis of the
infarct size. The percentage of the infarcted area was determined as described
previously<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. The heart weight-to-body
weight ratio (HW/BW), LV/BW, and RV/BW values were determined. Lungs and liver
were dehydrated (80&#x000b0;C) for 48 h and then weighed again to evaluate the water
percentage<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Diaphragm Collection and Measurement of CS Activity</title><p>A laparotomy and thoracotomy were performed to allow the complete excision of the
diaphragm. The right and left costal diaphragm muscle were weighed and
immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80&#x000b0;C for subsequent
analysis.</p><p>CS activity, an index of oxidative capacity, was determined in diaphragm muscle
by measuring with 5,5-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid; DTNB), as described by Alp
et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>. The absorption was
read spectrophotometrically at 412 nm, and the results are expressed as
nmol/min/mg protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The mean values and the standard deviation (&#x000b1; SD) were calculated for all
the analyzed data. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test was performed. A
two-way ANOVA compared the effects between groups (HF or Sham) and intervention
(RMT or Sed), followed by the Tukey <italic>post hoc</italic> test. Pearson's
correlation analysis was performed to test associations. A
<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically signi?cant. The GraphPad
Prism 6 program (GraphPad Software, CA, USA) was used for the data analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Mortality, Morphological Characteristics, Pulmonary and Hepatic

hemodynamics, as demonstrated by LV pressures, contractility and relaxation, as well
as decreased RV hypertrophy and lung congestion; 2) CS activity was decreased in the
diaphragm of the HF rats, and enhanced by RMT; and 3) Correlations were found
between CS activity and hemodynamic function parameters, as demonstrated by a
negative correlation between CS and LVEDP and a positive correlation between CS and
LVSP.</p><p>Our results highlight the particular link between hemodynamic dysfunction and the
oxidative impairment of diaphragm muscle. An increase in LVEDP and decrease in LVSP
were associated with CS activity reduction. Such a link may directly contribute to
the establishment and progression of lung congestion and RV overload in response to
HF. On the other hand, RMT clearly promotes the overall improvement of cardiac
hemodynamics, peripheral muscle oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial function,
here reflected by CS activity. This supports the notion that RMT is a viable
strategy to positively alter RV and lung alterations as consequence of HF
progression.</p><p>From a clinical perspective, RMT was shown to improve many outcomes related to the
progression and complexity of HF<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>, which include dyspnea, peripheral muscle sympathetic nervous
activity, oxygen uptake efficiency, circulatory power, recovery oxygen kinetics,
indices of cardiac performance, peak oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>) and quality
of life<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>. Furthermore, RMT
decrease PPC of postoperative atelectasis, pneumonia, duration of hospital
stay<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>, and improves
functional capacity submaximal and inspiratory muscle strength<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> in patients undergoing cardiac
surgery. However, the effect of RMT on metabolic adaptations in the diaphragm is not
fully understood.</p><p>Experimentally, our group has previously demonstrated RMT in HF rats improved
cardiovascular parameters, sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation, baroreflex
gain and respiratory mechanics<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.
However, we did not assess the effects of RMT on oxidative capacity in the diaphragm
in rats with HF, which could explain some potential physiologic muscular
mechanisms.</p><p>Few studies that directly assessed intrinsic skeletal muscle oxidative capacity in HF
models reported a decrease in both oxidative and glycolytic muscles<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>. Specifically, CS activity was
decreased in the experimental model<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> and clinical studies with HF<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>. Respiratory muscle strength in patients with HF
have been found to be significantly correlated to peak VO<sub>2</sub> and is an
independent predictor of survival<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. In rats with HF after induction of MI, the diaphragm has
reduced strength and function<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>,
however, the cellular processes leading to muscle dysfunction remain poorly
understood.</p><p>In normal rats, Bisschop et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>
verified that RMT leads to hypertrophy in IIa and IIb fiber types in the diaphragm.
In our study, we observed no difference in hemodynamic function, morphological
characteristics and CS activity after RMT in sham group, which can be partially
explained by the fact that sham rats do not present peripheral muscles alterations,
such as in the diaphragm, due to preserved cardiac and hemodynamic function. In
addition, the intensity of RMT used in this study was likely insufficient to produce
improvements in sham rats. Further studies should therefore be conducted to test
different RMT protocols and intensities in healthy rats.</p><p>Lower cardiac output, reduction of muscle blood flow, and consequently impairment
O<sub>2</sub> transport to skeletal muscle promotes disorders at the cellular
level in HF<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>, including the diaphragm muscle. In this context,
alterations in energy metabolism play a substantial role in the functional defects
such as decreased cardiac contractility, and decreased contraction and resistance to
fatigue of the skeletal muscle. These alterations are encountered in cardiac muscle
as well as in skeletal muscles and the diaphragm, and thus led to the proposal of a
metabolic myopathy in HF<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In canine and rat HF models, marked reductions in the complexes of the respiratory
chain have been described in both cardiac and skeletal muscles<sup>[<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>, which may sustain the abnormalities of cardiopulmonary
function and its interactions and blood flow redistribution. Muscle oxidative
capacities have been assessed by measuring respiration of mitochondria in
permeabilized fibers with no limitation of substrates, ADP or oxygen<sup>[<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>. The main mitochondrial pathways
were investigated by measuring activity of key enzymes: CS, an enzyme of the Krebs
cycle, COX, the complex IV of the respiratory chain, and mi-CK, an intermembrane
space enzyme involved in energy transfer between mitochondria and cytosol in
oxidative muscles<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>. Garnier et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> describe a
significant mitochondrial dysfunction and altered biochemical markers in HF rats,
with CS significantly reduced in the LV and soleus showing a lower sensitivity of
muscle to HF. Mitochondrial marker enzyme activities in fresh muscle homogenate were
measured in skeletal muscle in dogs with HF<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> and CS was significantly decreased, suggesting a lower
mitochondrial content<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>To better explore the relationship between beneficial changes of diaphragm oxidative
and hemodynamic function due to RMT in HF, further investigations of the respiratory
muscle performance, as well as other key metabolic and mitochondrial enzymes and
complexes, not performed in our study, are needed. Histological evaluation of the
adaptations in the lungs or diaphragm can also elucidate morphological alterations
in response to RMT in HF rats.</p><p>In the present study, we found that CS activity of the diaphragm in HF rats lower by
61% compared with the Sed-Sham group. After a 6-week RMT protocol, HF rats has a
142% increase in CS activity. Furthermore, we observed a significant correlation
between CS activity and hemodynamic function, as demonstrated by a negative
correlation between CS and LVEDP (r=-0.60, <italic>P</italic>=0.01) and positive
correlation between CS and LVSP (r=0.46, <italic>P</italic>=0.05).</p><p>Additionally, to our knowledge, this study was the first to observe a beneficial
change in oxidative metabolism after RMT in HF rats. These diaphragmatic muscle
changes observed here with RMT were consistent with those elicited by endurance
training of the limb muscles in normal subjects. These potential adaptations caused
by RMT on the diaphragm in HF rats could be explained by some physiological
consequences including: 1) an increase in the maximum speed of
contraction<sup>[<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup>; (2) an
attenuation of microvascular oxygen delivery-to-utilization mismatch; and,
consequently, 3) a decrease in fatigability<sup>[<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup>.</p><sec><title>Clinical Implications</title><p>CABG is recommended in patients with HF and left ventricular systolic dysfunction
and promotes benefits on cardiovascular mortality<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. The 10-years follow-up of the STICH (Surgical
Treatment for Ischemic Heart Failure) trial demonstrated a reduction in
all-cause mortality in patients with HF who received CABG associated to medical
therapy compared with medical therapy alone<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. However, PPCs following CABG surgery, such as
respiratory weakness, can influence on morbidity, mortality, and length of
hospital stay<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>It has been postulated that RMT increases inspiratory muscle strength and
endurance in patients with HF, which translates into marked improvement in
exercise tolerance and quality of life<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>. Moreover, preoperative<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> and postoperative<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> RMT improves functional capacity submaximal,
inspiratory muscle strength and decreases PPCs in patients undergoing cardiac
surgery<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Hulzebos et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> demonstrated
that preoperative RMT in patients undergoing CABG surgery, which include
patients with HF secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy (left ventricular ejection
fraction &#x0003c; 40%), reduced the incidence of PPCs (by 50% compared with patients
receiving usual care), and, consequently, reduced the duration of postoperative
hospitalization.</p><p>Diffuse parenchymal processes, and cardiogenic and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema
are among the causes of acute respiratory failure after cardiac
surgery<sup>[<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup>. Pulmonary
edema is related with reduced pulmonary and functional capacity; however, the
reduction of pulmonary edema decreases CPPs, including in patients undergoing
CABG surgery. In this context, experimentally, our group has previously
demonstrated that RMT decreased pulmonary edema and, consequently, improves
respiratory mechanics in HF rats<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>. In this study, rats with HF presented less pulmonary
congestion (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001) for training effect. We believe that
these results could contribute to a better understanding of these potential
mechanisms in the improvement of pulmonary and functional capacity with
decreased pulmonary edema.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>RMT produces beneficial adaptations on the diaphragm muscle, which is linked to

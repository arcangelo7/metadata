progressive tumours that often present themselves as diagnostic dilemmas,
resulting in delayed diagnosis. Also, extracardiac manifestations, including
abdominal pain, are extremely rare in patients with intracardiac tumors. We
herein present the case of a 15-year-old girl who presented with abdominal pain.
Echocardiography and thoracic computed tomography showed right atrial mass. The
patient underwent surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Eight months after
treatment, abdominal recurrence was detected. The abdominal mass was resected,
and radiotherapy and new chemotherapy protocol were given. The present case
illustrates a rare case of primary cardiac angiosarcoma posing a diagnostic
dilemma in an adolescent girl.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Hemangiosarcoma</kwd><kwd>Heart</kwd><kwd>Heart neoplasms</kwd><kwd>Child</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><table-wrap id="t1" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="20%" span="1"/><col width="80%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" style="background-color:#e6e7e8" rowspan="1">Abbreviations,

between 0.0017 and 0.28%<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. The majority of them are benign and sarcomas represent
the most common malignant tumors<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. Among primary adult cardiac sarcomas, angiosarcoma is
more common than rhabdomyosarcoma, but it remains an unusual occurrence. In this
report, we present a 15-year-old girl who was admitted to the emergency department
with a complaint of severe abdominal pain and who was diagnosed with cardiac
angiosarcoma.</p></sec><sec><title>CASE REPORT</title><p>A 15-year-old, Syrian refugee girl who was a high school student was admitted to the
emergency department with a history of 15 days of abdominal pain. On physical
examination, she is 160 cm tall and weighs 50 kg. She had no history of cancer in
her family. She presented with abdominal tenderness, hepatosplenomegaly and muffled
heart sounds. Abdominal and thoracic computed tomography (CT) showed
hepatosplenomegaly and solid mass in the right atrium and in the left mediastinum.
There was a massive pericardial and moderate right pleural effusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). Echocardiogram showed massive
pericardial effusion and a solid tumor in the right atrium expanding towards the
right ventricule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>).
(18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography
(PET/CT) scan revealed increased FDG uptake in the mediastinum and over the heart.
Pleural and pericardial effusion and intra-abdominal free fluid were also seen
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>

</p><sec><title>Surgical Technique</title><p>The patient was taken to the operation room under semi-urgent conditions. Tense
pericardium due to excessive pericardial liquid was observed after midline
sternotomy. The pericardium was opened and 1500 cc of serous liquid were
evacuated from the cavity. Macerated epicardial appearance and probable
malignant infiltration areas inside the right ventricle wall were seen. Patient
was heparinized (3 mg/kg) and the activated coagulation time (ACT) obtained was
above 400 seconds. Total cardiopulmonary bypass was started via aortic and
bicaval cannulation. Cardioplegia was infused after crossclamping of the
ascending aorta. The right atrium was opened with vertical incision. A solid
atrial mass that was completely invading the right atrial wall and also
prolapsing through the tricuspid valve and causing partial obstruction of right
ventricle inflow was observed. The mass was totally excised along with the right
atrial wall. This resected area was repaired by using glutaraldehyde-treated
autologous pericardium (0.1%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>).
After completion of repair procedure, de-airing was done. Patient was weaned off
the cardiopulmonary bypass without any inotropic support. The postoperative
period was uneventful.</p><p>

</p></sec><sec><title>Postoperative Course</title><p>The mass in the right atrium was reported as an angiosarcoma. On
immunohistochemical analysis, tumor cells were positive for cluster of
differentiation 31 (CD31), CD34, friend leukemia integration-1 (FLI-1) and
erythroblast transformation specific regulated gene-1 (ERG), but they were
negative for keratin, desmin, smooth muscle actin (SMA), myogenin, Human
melanoma black 45 (HMB45) and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). Ifosfamide/mesna/adriamycin (IMA) chemotherapy
combination was administered. After 6 cycles of chemotherapy, the patient was in
complete remission. A total dose of 50.4 Gy was administered to the operating
margin and mediastinal lymph nodes using 3-D conformal radiotherapy. Eight
months after the therapy was finished, the patient was admitted with abdominal
pain. Abdominopelvic and thoracic CT revealed an irregularly contoured mass in
the medial region of the right kidney. PET/ CT scan showed a new lesion, and it
was excised and reported as an angiosarcoma. The patient received 3 cycles of
gemcitabine/ docetaxel chemotherapy combination. After chemotherapy, a dose of
45 Gy was administered to the operating margin. Since the follow-up period of 20
months from the date of the diagnosis, the patient is in remission for 6 months
from the last recurrence.</p><p>

population. Cardiac tumors, either benign or malignant, are difficult to diagnose
due to their rarity, variety and nonspecificity of the symptoms.</p><p>Primary cardiac angiosarcomas in all age groups mostly occur in the right
atrium<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.
The most common complaints presented are dyspnea and chest pain, usually related to
a malignant cardiac effusion<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. The pericardium is frequently involved with a right
sided angiosarcoma; cardiac tamponade and pericardial effusion are common
complications<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. Our patient had a massive
pericardial effusion and malignant cells were seen in cytologic examination.
Extracardiac manifestations, including abdominal pain, are extremely rare in
patients with intracardiac tumors, like our case.</p><p>The rarity of this diagnosis has made it difficult to standardize therapy, but
surgical treatment is the main option. A multimodality treatment including
preoperative and/or postoperative chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy seems beneficial
for overall or progression-free survival. Using modern radiation techniques,
radiotherapy on the heart seems to be safe, without major cardiac
toxicity<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>To our knowledge, only 9 children cases of primary cardiac angiosarcoma were detailed
reported, including ours<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. The average age at
presentation is 12.3 years. There were 4 girls and 4 boys; one patient's gender was
not determined. Eight patients had right atrium involvement. Most patients presented
with dyspnea or chest pain. Our patient had an extracardiac manifestation. Six of 9
patients had a metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Six patients died with a
progressive disease.</p><p>A study about the frequency of cancer among Syrian and Turkish children has revealed
that most of cancer types were similar in frequency, but the percentage of children
with neuroblastoma and bone tumours was significantly higher in
refugees<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.
Preliminary outcomes in Syrian refugee children with cancer were similar to the
outcomes in Turkish children<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>As a result, children with abdominal pain have to be examined for extra-abdominal
diseases and cancer.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="5%" span="1"/><col width="95%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ECC</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Conception and study design; manuscript

worldwide and the saphenous vein being the most common conduit used, there is no
question that improving saphenous vein graft patency is one of the most
important tasks in CABG. This video describes the no-touch harvesting procedure
of the saphenous vein on an 80-year old man with hypertension, hyperlipidemia
and a previous myocardial infarction with percutaneous coronary intervention to
the right coronary artery. He was complaining of exertional chest pain and was
diagnosed with stable angina pectoris. The coronary angiography showed advanced
three vessel disease with significant stenoses in the left anterior descending
(LAD) artery, two marginal arteries (MAs) and the posterior descending artery
(PDA), in addition to an occluded diagonal artery (DA). The patient received a
triple sequential no-touch vein graft to the PDA and two MAs together with a
double sequential no-touch vein graft to the DA and LAD. A vein graft was used
to bypass the LAD due to the age of the patient and the low degree of stenosis
in the LAD. The no-touch harvesting technique is described in detail in the film
with complete narration. A follow-up of this patient was performed at three
months both clinically and with a computed tomography angiography (CTA). No
angina pectoris symptoms were reported by the patient and the wounds in the
chest and lower limb were completely healed. The CTA showed patent no-touch
saphenous vein grafts to all the distal anastomoses.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Coronary Artery Bypass</kwd><kwd>Saphenous Vein</kwd><kwd>Vascular Patency</kwd><kwd>Mammary Arteries</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><table-wrap id="t1" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="10%" span="1"/><col width="90%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" style="background-color:#e6e7e8" rowspan="1">Abbreviations,

infarction with percutaneous coronary intervention to the right coronary artery. The
ejection fraction was 55% and he was complaining of exertional chest pain. The
coronary angiography showed advanced three-vessel disease with significant stenoses
in the left anterior descending (LAD) artery, two marginal arteries (MAs) and the
posterior descending artery (PDA), in addition to an occluded diagonal artery (DA).
The patient received a triple sequential no-touch vein graft to the PDA and two MAs
together with a double sequential no-touch vein graft to the DA and LAD. A vein
graft was used to bypass the LAD due to the age of the patient and the low degree
(60-70%) of stenosis in the LAD.</p></sec><sec><title>SURGICAL TECHNIQUE</title><p>The no-touch technique in harvesting the saphenous vein consists of several steps in
order to get a good quality conduit as well as to reduce leg wound complications
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Video 1</xref>). Previous studies have shown a
superior patency for the no-touch vein grafts in both the short- and
long-term<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>.</p><p><fig id="f2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Video 1</label><caption><p>Surgical technique of no-touch saphenous vein graft harvesting in
coronary artery bypass grafting.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-34-01-0098-g02"/></fig></p><sec><title>Vein Mapping</title><p>Preoperative vein mapping facilitates rapid and accurate location of the vein,
thus reducing soft tissue injury and the creation of tissue flaps. It also helps
to predetermine the best segment of the vein for grafting.</p></sec><sec><title>Exposure</title><p>An incision is made through the skin and the saphenous vein is exposed by lifting
the edges of the skin. This enables the identification of the correct dissection
plane. The diathermy knife can consequently be used safely. The subdermal
vessels are ligated to avoid overuse of diathermy.</p></sec><sec><title>Marking of Pedicle</title><p>The pedicle is marked with a diathermy knife approximately 0.5 cm from the both
sides of the vein. The large vasa vasorum and the small side branches are
ligated proximally with clips. On the other hand, larger side branches should be
ligated with a suture.</p></sec><sec><title>Removal from Bed</title><p>The saphenous vein is removed from its bed using both scissors and a diathermy
knife. The same dissection plane is maintained along the whole length of the
graft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). After removal, the vein
is stored in heparinized blood.</p><p><fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>No-touch vein graft in situ.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-34-01-0098-g01"/></fig></p></sec><sec><title>Closure of the Wound</title><p>The wound should be closed in two to three layers. The first layer is especially
important to avoid the creation of a dead space where the fascia is usually
included in the suture. The second layer is to bring the edges together without
tension in the skin. The third layer is with a continuous intracutaneous suture.
We recommend performing two separate incisions excluding the knee area as this
is more convenient for the patient.</p></sec><sec><title>Checking for Leakage</title><p>After starting cardiopulmonary bypass and before cross clamping the aorta, the
vein graft is connected to the arterial line and any unligated side branches can
be identified. The end of the graft is then prepared for the distal anastomoses.
This can be achieved in off-pump surgery by performing the proximal anastomsis
first. Only one side of the vein is dissected. This allows a simple grasping of
the pedicle without direct manipulation of the vein.</p></sec><sec><title>Distal Anastomosis</title><p>The perivascular tissue is used to grasp the vein, giving a good exposure during
the suturing. After each complete distal anastomosis, the vein is briefly
connected to the arterial line to check for leakage. Finally, the pedicle is
fixed to the epicardium at the level of the anastomosis. The no-touch vein
simplifies the use of sequential grafts as kinking is not an issue.</p></sec><sec><title>Central Anastomosis</title><p>After release of the cross-clamp, the grafts are now connected to the arterial
line to allow early myocardial perfusion. This also helps to determine graft
length, recheck for bleeding and to maintain relaxation of the vein. The central
anastomoses are performed in a classic fashion. A final inspection of the grafts
before weaning off cardiopulmonary bypass is also recommended.</p></sec><sec><title>Flow Measurement</title><p>Flow measurement with a transonic coronary flow probe is always performed after
weaning off cardiopulmonary bypass.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="5%" span="1"/><col width="95%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026;

Smoking, male sex, age, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
hyperlipidemia and family history are risk factors for this disease. It is often
asymptomatic and is diagnosed incidentally. Rupture of an AAA is a catastrophic
event with high mortality.</p><p>Pheochromocytoma is an unexpected cause of hypertension. As result of catecholamine
secretion persistent or intermittent symptoms occur. Despite the lack of evidence,
pheochromocytomas might have a role in the etiology of aortic aneurysms. The
coexistence of pheochromocytoma and AAA should be carefully managed during surgical
treatment considering characteristics of both lesions.</p></sec><sec><title>CASE REPORT</title><p>A 57-year-old man with hypertension, chronic kidney disease, chronic pulmonary
obstructive disease, a 33 cm<sup>2</sup>/m body mass index (BMI), and a history of
ureterorenoscopy four years earlier was admitted to the emergency department with
flank pain. Renal colic due to urolithiasis was suspected. A computed tomography
(CT) scan without contrast revealed multiple renal cysts and two calculi larger than
1 cm on the right renal calix, an aortic aneurysm 57 mm in diameter, and
retroperitoneal hematoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">1B</xref>). The patient's general condition
deteriorated, he became hypotensive and lost consciousness. The classical triad of a
ruptured AAA is easily identified with the aid of radiological imaging instead of
palpation of a pulsatile mass. The patient was immediately transferred to the
operating room and aortobiiliac graft replacement was performed with an 18x9 mm
bifurcated graft for a ruptured infrarenal AAA. Initially, manual compression at the
level of renal artery and vein was performed by the surgical team, and the admission
of bolus doses of noradrenalin and crystalloids by the anesthesia team provided
enough time to expose the neck of the aneurysm and to perform proximal clamping to
the infrarenal aorta. Distally, both iliac arteries were exposed and clamped. After
proximal and distal control, 5000 units of heparin were administered intravenously.
Longitudinal aortotomy was performed. The aneurysm sac was free of thrombus, and the
ostium of the inferior mesenteric artery was patent. A tear was identified on the
left side of the aorta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>). Our initial
strategy to implant a tubular graft was changed based on the need to excise the
aortic bifurcation due to its friable tissue. The inferior mesenteric artery without
sufficient backflow was replanted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>).
The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. He was extubated after 48
hours. Continuous positive airway pressure with a mask was maintained for four days
postoperatively. In the postoperative course, the patient underwent several
hemodialysis sessions, was oxygen dependent, and experienced paralytic ileus.
Hemodialysis was needed daily after postoperative day 2, even though sufficient
urine output was present on postoperative day 5. On postoperative day 6, abdominal
distension was apparent despite nasogastric decompression. Oral administration of 50
ml of contrast in 500 ml of water was used 8 hours before radiography to evaluate
the prolonged postoperative ileus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>).
As there was passage to the colon, we continued to follow up with dexpanthenol 500
mg twice/day, neostigmine 0.5 mg once/day, and an enema twice/day. Oral contrast was
administered again on postoperative day 9 to profit from its stimulant effect on
intestinal peristalsis<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. The need
for hemodialysis and the postoperative ileus resolved 10 days after surgery, and the
patient was mobilized without oxygen support. During the postoperative course, the
patient was hypertensive, and tachycardia was present. He was on sinus rhythm and
oral metoprolol 100 mg twice/day was given to keep the rhythm at 100 beats/min. His
blood pressure was controlled with nitroglycerin and alpha (&#x003b1;) and calcium
(Ca) channel blockers. We investigated the potential causes of this condition.
Two-dimensional echocardiography was performed; the results showed normal ejection
fraction and mild tricuspid insufficiency. Re-evaluation of the initial preoperative
CT scan revealed a left suprarenal incidentaloma with 4 cm diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>). The presence of a left suprarenal
adenoma on the CT scan with an unenhanced density greater than 10 Hounsfield units
resulted in the suspicion that a pheochromocytoma was the etiology of the patient's
hypertension<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p><p><fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Non-contrast computed tomography images showing a large haematoma on the

indication of the need for elective surgical or endovascular treatment. Endovascular
procedures are commonly performed for treatment, but access to these procedures can
be limited depending on a hospital's capabilities. Rupture of an AAA is a
catastrophic event with a high mortality rate. In aortic emergencies, the transfer
of a patient should be avoided and urgent surgery is indicated<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Patients with pheochromocytoma often have hypertension and the triad of palpitation,
headache, and sweating. Kota et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> reported that 14% of cases with pheochromocytoma had additional
vascular lesions. Few cases of pheochromocytoma coexisting with aneurysms have been
reported. Management of cardiovascular stability is crucial in such cases.
Optimization of the hemodynamic status can last months in elective cases. An
increased risk of rupture of the aneurysm is present due to excess catecholamine and
hypertension. Intraoperative and postoperative managements of an aortic aneurysm
include strict blood pressure stabilization, which can be challenging in the
presence of pheochromocytoma. In a case diagnosed with pheochromocytoma after
surgery, dramatic hemodynamic changes were reported during surgery to repair a
ruptured AAA<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. In our case, the
most apparent hemodynamic change was the persistent hypertension that began after
aortic clamping. It reached 160 mmHg, even though the patient was receiving
antihypertensive therapy. While a hypothetical association of catecholamine-induced
vasculitis or weakening of the vascular wall has been proposed as the reason for the
coexistence of pheochromocytoma and AAA<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>, evidence to support that claim is insufficient. In our case,
the Glasgow Aneurysm Score (GAS) was 88, which is a predictor of high mortality. The
patient survived the operation and the early postoperative period of 30 days, and he
was referred to a tertiary center for further investigation. In elective cases,
excision of the suprarenal tumor followed by a second operation for AAA, or a
concomitant surgery for pheochromocytoma and AAA, can be considered. For a ruptured
AAA, emergency aortic surgery is indicated; excision of the tumor can be conducted
at a later point. During this period, the blood pressure must be managed very
carefully. In patients with resistant hypertension and aortic aneurysms, a high
index of suspicion is necessary to diagnose suprarenal tumors. Radiologic imaging
and assessing the density of a tumor can be helpful for making a diagnosis.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="50%" span="1"/><col width="50%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">AAA</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Substantial contributions to the conception or design

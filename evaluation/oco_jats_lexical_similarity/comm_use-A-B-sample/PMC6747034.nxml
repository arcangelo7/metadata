The cyclone made landfall near the city of Beira on 15 March.</p><p>The vaccines were donated by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, from the global cholera vaccine stockpile and arrived in Beira on 2 April. Distribution was assured by approximately 1200 community volunteers who reached more than 800&#x000a0;000 people in the four districts affected by the cyclone.</p><p>The campaign was supported by partners including the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children's Fund, (UNICEF), M&#x000e9;decins Sans Fronti&#x000e8;res (MSF), International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and Save the Children.</p><p>In Mozambique, WHO has also deployed experts, including epidemiologists, logisticians and disease-prevention experts, and has helped with the distribution of supplies, including intravenous fluids, diagnostic tests, oral rehydration solution and other medical supplies to support cholera treatment centres.</p><p>WHO is also supporting health response efforts in Malawi and Zimbabwe, which were also affected by heavy rains and flooding. According to United Nations&#x000a0;Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs some 1.6 million people in the three countries have been affected by the cyclone.</p><p>In Malawi, WHO has sent medicines and medical supplies&#x000a0;to meet the needs of tens of thousands of people and is continuing to support six district outreach clinics.

The committee agreed that given the current state of knowledge, it would be irresponsible at this time for anyone to proceed with clinical applications of human germline genome editing and called for WHO to establish a central registry on human genome editing research.</p><p>The committee invited input from scientists conducting human genome editing research on the technical environment and current governance arrangements that relate to work in this area. Over the next two years, the committee will consult a wide range of stakeholders and provide recommendations for a comprehensive genome editing governance framework that is scalable, sustainable and appropriate for use at the international, regional, national and local levels. The committee will solicit the views of multiple stakeholders including patient groups, civil society, ethicists and social scientists.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/19-03-2019-who-expert-panel-paves-way-for-strong-international-governance-on-human-genome-editing">https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/19-03-2019-who-expert-panel-paves-way-for-strong-international-governance-on-human-genome-editing</ext-link></p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>Ebola cases exceed 1000</title><p>A total of 1186 confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases had been reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as of 9 April.

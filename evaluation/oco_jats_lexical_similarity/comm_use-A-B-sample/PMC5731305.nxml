until the late 1980's, little attention was drawn to surgical missions. Throughout that
entire period, efforts of international aid agencies were largely directed toward
control or eradication of major infectious scourges such as malaria, typhoid, plague,
and other tropical and sanitation-based public health problems. It has become evident
over the last decade, however, that global epidemiologic and demographic shifts have
been changing the burden of disease in all societies. Developing countries are now
facing a dramatic increase in noncommunicable diseases, primarily cardiovascular disease
(CVD). 2017 Statistics from the World Health Organization confirm that cardiovascular
disease remains the leading cause of death globally, and over three quarters (82%) of
those CVD deaths take place in low- and middle-income countries<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Like Brazil, some of these countries have pockets of excellence in surgical care, but the
majority lack such care outside of main cities, amplified by a paucity of necessary
equipment and/or formal training. For example, in Germany there is 1 cardiovascular
surgeon per 87,000 people, in China there is 1 per 208,000, and in West Africa, there is
1 cardiac surgeon per 26.5 million people<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>
<fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Population in million per cardiac surgeon<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rbccv-32-06-0III-g01"/></fig>
</p><p>Thus, cardiovascular mission formats can be varied, providing preventive care, direct
surgical treatment, the donation of supplies and equipment, and/or building a program
for sustained training and clinical care. While each objective has value and is
interrelated to some extent, every mission follows a different pathway and <italic>modus
operandi</italic><sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. We implore
surgeons and organizations to craft their missions around this foundation: to train,
empower, and support local clinicians toward the shared goal of a self-sustaining center
for their community.</p><p>While this may seem like an obvious strategy, a common model for many surgical missions
surrounds the singular goal of completing as many operations as possible in a short
interval. Although this is well intentioned and may serve more patients in the
short-term, the scope is myopic, since goals of speed and efficiency often eliminate or
minimize teaching, training and the one-to-one skill transfer that is critical for local
team advancement. Rather, multiple recurring trips providing graded levels of assistance
and support, allowing the local team to take an increasingly primary role in the
progression toward independence. Taking the time to teach surgical judgment,
intraoperative and postoperative management may limit the number of cases achieved per
mission, but is a critical investment in the local clinicians that will pay dividends
for the community in the long term.</p><p>Hundreds of organizations provide medical and public health services around the world;
they include religious brigades, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), relief groups,
United Nations affiliates, and military health regiments. Several groups focus on
cardiovascular care by trying to reduce the imbalance in access to it across the globe.
Humanitarian organizations such as CardioStart International, Team Heart, VOOM
Foundation, and Heart to Heart, amongst many others, rely on volunteer teams donating
their time and expertise to provide diagnostic investigations and surgical treatment for
both acquired and congenital heart defects. Providers are largely from the Western
world; however, manpower and local volunteers are keys to the success of any
mission<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>, and it is important to consider the vision and goals
of any organization with which one aligns.</p><p>To distill it down further, there are many contextual features about medical volunteer
work that can provide ethical challenges to volunteers. By the very nature of the work,
volunteers travel to areas that lack resources including equipment, personnel, and
infrastructure. Thus, there are three major challenges to be faced in preparation for a
humanitarian mission: 1) foreign setting; 2) sustainability; and 3) medical
education<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>First, there is an understandable preoccupation with avoiding complications that may
arise from working with unfamiliar colleagues in a foreign setting and caring for
patients who speak a different language and may have never before seen a doctor.
Complications that do occur are often attributable to insufficient screening of patients
or inadequate follow-up, so it is of paramount importance to develop strong ties with
local physicians who can offer preoperative insight and postoperative
continuity<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>. This is a crucial collaboration at every step, since
even surgical decisions such as valve prosthesis often rely on local and/or cultural
dynamics, such as whether a patient will be able to afford or have access to warfarin,
or if the nearest clinic to check an INR is a 2-day walk in good weather conditions from
a remote village.</p><p>The second feature is important not only for volunteers, but also for institutions and
sponsors of medical service trips to consider logistics and the protocol-implementation
required to maintain sustainability within the constructs of the host program. This may
involve how their work will advance beyond the short-term experience, training local
providers, researching supply chains, establishing local infrastructure, and maintaining
long-term relationships. The visiting team must work in collaboration with the local
team to build an empowering partnership based on respect for their skills, knowledge,
traditions and, whenever possible, using locally available equipment and supplies, such
as medications to closely replicate a future scenario sustained without international
aid<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Lastly, the fundamental and primary goal of any mission should be to provide teaching to
local staff that encourages methods &#x00026; techniques to support the improvement of
patient care for the long run. This can be achieved most effectively by implementing a
long-term educational programme. According to Corno<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>, the most suitable and consistent model of long-term
humanitarian educational programmes should include the following steps: 1) site
selection; 2) demographic research; 3) site assessment; 4) organization of surgical
educational teams; 5) regular frequency of surgical educational missions; 6) programme
evolution and maturation; 6) educational outreach and interactive support.</p><p>Again, this stresses the balance of direct patient care with medical education as very
important and emphasizes that any surgical society, organization, institution or
individual must prioritize the purpose and motivation for serving. A humanitarian
surgeon's focus will always be on patients, but local health care providers and the
communities they serve can, and should, both benefit. Ultimately, success should not be
measured by the number of successful operations of any given mission, but by the
successful operations that the local team performs after the visiting team
leaves<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.</p><p><disp-quote><p><bold>"The next generation of surgeons, while meeting needs locally, must
also take a leadership role globally - the need for international
partnership has never been greater."</bold></p><attrib><italic><bold>Doruk Ozgediz, MD</bold></italic></attrib></disp-quote></p><p>In this context, a volunteer is one who acts in recognition of a need, with an attitude
of social responsibility and without concern for monetary profit, gaining beyond what is
necessary to one's physical well-being. As a specialty, cardiovascular surgeons are
uniquely positioned to have an important role in national/ international, home/abroad,
or domestic/foreign humanitarian activity because we are well suited to adapt, improvise
and function in unusual or unexpected situations that often require "thinking outside of
the box".</p><p>The enduring commitment of surgeons to these matters inspires confidence that solutions
will continue to come from the surgical community, in keeping with a rich professional
legacy. With an emerging generation passionate about their ability to give back in a
global society, and so many practicing and retired surgeons pursuing similar
opportunities to contribute, the time is ripe to foster these interests and
actions<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>.</p><p><disp-quote><p><bold>"By giving of your time and heart, you will not only help to
advance the humane practice of surgery, but you will also reap the
rewards of belonging to the greatest humanitarian profession in the

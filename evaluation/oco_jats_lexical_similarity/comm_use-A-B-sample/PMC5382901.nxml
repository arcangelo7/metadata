patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections, with the result that
some of these patients now develop degenerative diseases, such as atherosclerotic
aneurysms<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. The technical
advances achieved over recent decades have significantly improved the results of
surgical treatment for thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA), which now achieves
acceptable morbidity and mortality rates<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. As a less invasive
method, endovascular treatment has shown promising results for treatment for these
complex aneurysms, although the long-term results are not yet well known and the
reintervention rate is considerable<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. Atherosclerotic TAAA in HIV-positive patients is rare and, for
this reason, this article will describe the case of a patient with HIV infection and
a symptomatic TAAA treated surgically.</p></sec><sec><title>CASE REPORT</title><p>A male, 63-year-old patient was brought to the emergency service complaining of
intense pain in the dorsal lumbar region, with onset approximately 12 hours
previously and accompanied by nausea and vomiting. He was an HIV virus carrier and
had been on treatment for 20 years, and was taking tenofovir, lamivudine and
efavirenz at the time of presentation. He had a history of hypertension, under
control, and had been a smoker since 13 years of age (40 cigarettes/day). He was an
ex-user of illicit drugs (cocaine, marijuana and injectable drugs) and was hepatitis
B and C positive. He was in good general health, free from fever, hemodynamically
stable, and cardiac and pulmonary auscultation were normal. His abdomen was
depressible and flaccid and he reported tenderness in response to deep palpation in
the upper left quadrant and an expansive, pulsating mass was evident in the
epigastrium, however, there were no signs of peritoneal irritation. Extremities were
warm and perfused and all peripheral pulses were symmetrical and normal.</p><p>Laboratory test results were as follows: hemoglobin, 15.2g/dL; white blood cell
count, 8950/mm<sup>3</sup> (without left shift), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 7
mm; creatinine, 0.9 mg/dL; CD4 T lymphocytes, 760 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>; and HIV
viral load undetectable by polymerase chain reaction. Blood cultures were performed
(3 samples) and later returned negative. Full abdominal echography showed an
abdominal aortic aneurysm involving the renal arteries with a maximum diameter of
approximately 5 cm. Thoracoabdominal angiotomography showed an aneurysmal dilatation
of the distal thoracic aorta extending to the infra-renal abdominal aorta with
maximum thoracic diameter of 6.2 cm and maximum abdominal diameter of 5.6 cm - type
V TAAA according to the Crawford-Safi classification<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>).
Since symptoms were persistent, a preoperative clinical assessment was conducted and
surgical treatment was prescribed. Access was achieved via
thoraco-phreno-laparotomy, with full exposure of the aorta from the 6<sup>th</sup>
intercostal space to the aortoiliac bifurcation. An atherosclerotic aneurysm was
identified, with atheromatous plaques, but free from any sign of inflammation or
localized purulent secretion. The repair was accomplished by endoaneurysmorrhaphy
with interposition of a 20 mm straight Dacron graft, using the clamp and go
technique, with no bypasses or shunts. All visceral branches, including the left
renal artery, were encompassed with a single suture line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). The clamping time for proximal anastomosis was 9
minutes, mesenteric and renal ischemia duration was 20 minutes (island anastomosis
of the graft at the orifices of the visceral vessels), and the time taken for distal
anastomosis at the aortoiliac bifurcation was 11 minutes. Cell salvage was used to
replace 500 mL of blood, from total bleeding of 800 mL, and blood transfusion was
not needed.</p><p>

</p><p>The patient responded extremely well during the postoperative period, achieving
hemodynamic stability without vasoactive drugs, was extubated approximately 6 hours
after the end of surgery, had good diuresis (600 mL/12 hours), and was discharged
from the intensive care unit within 36 hours. The patient did not suffer any type of
complication in the ward and exhibited good conditions for hospital discharge on the
8<sup>th</sup> postoperative day.</p><p>Around 30 days after surgery, a control angiotomography showed patent visceral
vessels and other features of the reconstruction were free from problems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). The patient remained well during the
28-month follow-up period.</p><p>

</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Surgical treatment of TAAA is still a therapeutic challenge, although at some centers
of excellence mortality rates are now acceptable, approaching 5%<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. The risks involved in the
procedure are greater in urgent situations, such as with symptomatic patients, and
mortality rates can approach 35%<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. Currently, branched/fenestrated endoprostheses appear promising
for treatment of TAAA, although the long-term complications and mortality rates are
not yet negligible<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. Another
treatment option is hybrid intervention, combining endovascular and open approaches
to treat these aneurysms, however, the risk of perioperative death can also be
high<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The immunological status of patients infected with HIV has an influence on decision
making. Therefore, in patients who have advanced HIV disease (<italic>e.g.</italic>,
Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome), malnutrition and CD4 count below 200
cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, conservative treatment should be considered. In patients
with CD4 levels higher than 500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, management should be
equivalent to that for the population in general. For patients with intermediate CD4
values (from 200 to 500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>), less-invasive treatment should be
considered (e<italic>.g.,</italic> endovascular or extra-anatomic bypass)<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. Our patient had an undetectable
viral load and good immunological status, with a CD4 level of 760
cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, which is why we decided to offer open surgical
treatment.</p><p>Development of aneurysms in HIV-positive patients may occur in a variety of different
manners: as a result of direct action of the virus on the aorta wall, triggering an
inflammatory process; bacterial infections of aorta with prior degeneration,
characterizing a mycotic aneurysm; or degeneration of the aorta wall, resulting in
atherosclerotic aneurysms, the appearance of which may be anticipated by changes to
lipid metabolism caused by antiretroviral therapy<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>.
Aneurysmal disease provoked by HIV is a distinct clinical entity, with no
well-defined etiology, and which generally affects younger patients without risk
factors for atherosclerotic disease<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>. It is generally associated with a reduction in CD4 levels and
it can lead to adventitial damage and injury to the <italic>vasa vasorum</italic> by
HIV<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. These aneurysms are saccular and are found in
atypical sites, tending to be multiple, with carotid and femoral arteries the most
frequently involved<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. Surgical treatment of patients
with aneurysmal disease related to HIV has achieved limited results. A study by
Ronns &#x00026; Paruk<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> described
226 HIV-positive patients with peripheral arterial disease and a mean age of 36
years, 111 treated for aneurysms and 115 for occlusive disease. The majority of
these patients were treated with open surgery and the perioperative mortality rate
was 9%<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>. In some cases,
aneurysms may be associated with infectious processes, of which salmonella,
tuberculosis and <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> are the most frequent
causes<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>However, HIV-positive patients may also have long survival and develop
atherosclerotic aneurysms due to exposure to cardiovascular risk factors<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. In the case described here, the
history of smoking and hypertension, the patient&#x02019;s age and his good immunological
status led to designation of an atherosclerotic cause of the thoracoabdominal
aneurysm. Mirza et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> also
described a patient carrying HIV who was treated for an atherosclerotic aneurysm of
the ascending aorta.</p><p>The duration of aortic clamping is linked with the risk of developing visceral
complications, such as mesenteric ischemia and renal failure requiring hemodialysis,
and also to increased mortality<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.
Visceral ischemia not exceeding 40 minutes can greatly reduce these risks. In our
case, proximal, visceral and distal anastomoses were performed in 9, 11 and 11
minutes, respectively. In this context, constant training and improvement of the
entire team is important, because results are also dependent on the number of
procedures conducted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Antiretroviral therapy has significantly increased survival of HIV patients. As a
result, cardiovascular diseases have become an important cause of later deaths among
these patients. This is why knowledge of the evolution and results of treatment for
different types of cardiovascular disease is essential when managing these patients.
Certain ethical considerations are also involved in treatment of HIV-positive
patients, and a judicious and considered decision should be made, reserving
conservative treatment of patients with advanced HIV-related disease, while
seropositive patients with favorable clinical conditions should be offered treatment
similar to that offered to a seronegative patient.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="10%" span="1"/><col width="90%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors&#x02019; roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MLL</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Conception and study design; realization of operations;

Its clinical application focuses on the repair, replacement, and regeneration of cells, tissues, and organs by approaches including cell reprogramming, stem cell transplantation, tissue engineering, activating factors, and clone treatment. RM has become a hot point of research in China and other countries. China&#x02019;s main and local governments have attached great importance to RM and given strong support in relevant policies and funding. About 3.5 billion RMB has been invested in this field. Since 1999, China has established about 30 RM centers and cooperates with many advanced countries in RM research and benefits from their cooperation. However, China needs to develop standards, regulations, and management practices suitable for the healthy development of RM. In this review, we focus on its great demand, capacity, and relative regulations.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Regenerative medicine</kwd><kwd>Stem cell</kwd><kwd>Tissue engineering</kwd><kwd>China</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81121004</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Annually, about 100 million Chinese patients will receive treatment by tissue repair and regeneration technologies because of the sharp increase in various injuries, accidents, and diseases of aging. However, the current paradigm of &#x0201c;healing by scar tissue replacement,&#x0201d; regardless of superficial tissues or visceral organs, is stagnating and is far away from the ultimate goal of &#x0201c;regenerating the impaired organ.&#x0201d; Regenerative medicine (RM) is gradually being used to restore the intrinsic repair ability with stem cell transplantation, tissue engineering, activating factors, cell reprogramming, and genetic treatments. RM holds sound promise of restoring organ function that is impaired because of congenital disorders, acquired disease, trauma, and aging by replacing or regenerating cells, tissues, and even organs. RM is expected to transcend traditional organ transplantation and replacement. Stem cell technology and tissue engineering have an outstanding role in RM. RM will become one of the most promising areas of life science in the twenty-first century&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>In the past 20&#x000a0;years, the RM market has continued to grow in China and other countries such as the USA, Europe, Japan, and Singapore. As the largest developing country, China has impressed the world with its findings in stem cells, tissue engineering, active molecules, and gene therapy as well as its national strategies and regulation of RM. These achievements may benefit China in both disease treatment and society development&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Review</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Strategies, guidance, funding, and industrialization of RM in china</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>National strategies</title><p>The central government of China supports the development of RM.

Also, local governments have adopted stem cell research as one of the priorities of technological development and provided active support. Relevant government departments and academia have paid close attention to and encouraged the development of RM. In the <italic>Science &#x00026; Technology on Public Health in China: A Roadmap to 2050</italic>, issued by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and the <italic>Study on the Long- and Medium-Term Development Strategy for China Engineering Science and Technology</italic>, issued by the Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://news.sciencenet.cn/htmlnews/2012/12/273300-3.shtm">http://news.sciencenet.cn/htmlnews/2012/12/273300-3.shtm</ext-link>), RM was considered a major research field. In the <italic>Roadmap of Translational Medicine in China</italic> issued by CAE, RM and biotherapy are main fields.

After 1999, the MST approved the National Program on Key Basic Research Project (973 Program) related to tissue engineering, and the stem cell field had the largest number of &#x0201c;973 Program&#x0201d; projects. Research into the clinical transformation and application of stem cell therapy was established in the biotechnology and medical technology field of the &#x0201c;863 Program.&#x0201d; The National Natural Science Foundation (NNSF) funded about 200 million RMB for this study, including 5627 items (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">b</xref>). Up to now, about 3 billion RMB from the MST, CAS, and NNSF has been invested in this field. Both the amount of funding and number of projects are increasing annually. Other funding for RM from companies is about 500 million RMB. In 2015, NNSF plans to invest RM research as its &#x0201c;Great Research Plan,&#x0201d; and MST has issued its new scientific research grand with about 21 billion RMB in RM field.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>National Natural Science Foundation of China investment in regenerative medicine from 2000 to 2014. <bold>a</bold> Amount of funding. <bold>b</bold> Number of funds</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41038_2016_46_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Translating outcomes into industrialization</title><p>The establishment of centers and technological translational application are important for RM development. Since 1999, China has established about 30 RM centers. These centers are involved in stem cell research and its translational application (e.g., national stem cell east center and national stem cell centers in Tianjin, Qingdao, Wuxi, Taizhou, etc.) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioon.com/biology/cell/28500.shtml">http://www.bioon.com/biology/cell/28500.shtml</ext-link>); national stem cell and RM technology innovation strategic alliance (sponsors and governing members include 27 first-class research institutes, well-known three-A hospitals, several &#x0201c;211 Project&#x0201d; key universities and industry leaders); and a tissue engineering innovation center in Shanghai. In 2011, the first academic workstation for the industrialization of stem cell technology was launched in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Companies such as Cyagen Biosciences (Guangzhou) and Hangzhou Biowish Technology (Biowish) are specialized in the development and sales of stem cell products. In 2009, NeoStem announced that it had reached an exclusive agreement for strengthening biomedical cooperation with Shanghai enterprises. This agreement aims to establish a network of stem cell collection and treatment centers in Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces. In 2010, the Beike Stem Cell Bank and Stem Cell Preparation Laboratory successfully passed the ISO 9001 quality management system certification and obtained the qualification certification issued by China Quality Certification Center, becoming the first comprehensive stem cell bank to pass ISO 9001 quality management system certification in China (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioon.com/industry/enterprisenews/432100.shtml">http://www.bioon.com/industry/enterprisenews/432100.shtml</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Production in academic fields</title><p>Publication of valued scientific papers is one of the very important indicators to evaluate investment and production in academic fields. The total number of scientific papers dealing with RM has increased quickly in China, as has the number published in leading scientific journals in China and internationally (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Since the 1960s, the USA has published 599 articles about stem cells in <italic>Cell</italic> and its subjournals (36), Germany published 45, Japan 36, and China only 17. Since 2000, the number of annual patent applications for stem cells has increased quickly and amounted to 1333 in 2009. In 2011, the Chinese literature related to stem cells outnumbered that of published by German, Japanese, and UK researchers and ranked second. In 2012, it had increased. In terms of citations, the USA ranked&#x000a0;the first, with a mean of 32.2 citations per item. However, citations for Chinese publications are increasing annually, and the mean&#x000a0;number is currently 10.19. For patent applications, as of March 2010, the number of China stem cell-related patent applications and patent applications as a patent priority country was ranked the&#x000a0;sixth and third in the world, respectively.

Even some large foreign pharmaceutical companies, such as General Electric and Sanofi-Aventis, have invested in China for stem cell-related research and achieved relevant results (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://lib.cet.com.cn/paper/szb_con.aspx?id=140472">http://lib.cet.com.cn/paper/szb_con.aspx?id=140472</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Also, the use of theories and skills of RM in military medicine is one of the important fields in the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab5"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Collaborations between China and other countries in regenerative medicine research</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Country of collaboration</th><th>Time</th><th>Objects</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2">France</td><td>2005</td><td>Institute of Zoology (IOZ), Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the French National Institute for Agricultural Research</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>The Chinese-French Joint Laboratory of Biology of Embryonic Cells of Mammals</td></tr><tr><td>Australia</td><td>2007</td><td>Sino-Australia Center of Excellence for Stem Cell Science</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Canada</td><td>2007</td><td>Monash Immunology and Stem Cell Laboratories (MISCL) was awarded a federal government grant to establish a joint Australia-China Centre for Excellence in Stem Cell Science with Peking University.</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>The Ministry of Science and Technology and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research signed a memorandum of understanding.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">UK</td><td>2005</td><td>The Committee of the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the UK Medical Research Council signed a memorandum of cooperation.</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>Scottish Centre for Regenerative Medicine (SCRM) and Peking University Stem Cell Research Center (PKUSCRC) established a national international joint research center.</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>UK Medical Research Council and the National Natural Science Fund Committee cooperated to jointly fund a stem cell research project.</td></tr><tr><td>USA</td><td>2009</td><td>The California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) and the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology (MST) signed an agreement to collaborate on stem cell research.</td></tr><tr><td>Germany</td><td>2009</td><td>The National Natural Science Fund Committee and the German Science Foundation cooperated to jointly fund a stem cell research project.</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Great demands in RM are not only in China but also in the world. Their theories and key skills or products are used not only in peacetime but also in military field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The Chinese government attaches great importance to this field, and vigorous investments from the government and companies may accelerate the progress in basic research and translational application. Innovation and international cooperation will be emphasized in future studies. Other sound administrative system, laws, technical specifications, and guidelines are very important in pushing their healthy and orderly development.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was supported in part by the National Nature Science Foundation of China (81121004, 81230041, 81171812, 81272105, and 81171798) and the National Basic Science and Development Programme (973 Program, 2012CB518105) and National Science and Technology Major Project (2011ZXJ07104B-03B).</p><sec id="d30e1347"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>BC and XF conceived and designed the project, collected and analyzed the data, and participated in the writing process.

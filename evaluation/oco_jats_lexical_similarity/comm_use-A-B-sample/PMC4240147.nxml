The assessment of these recommendations (against the five criteria listed in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1">Box 1</xref>) to evaluate their potential to be quality indicators employed a modified version of the iterated consensus rating procedure (which is recommended as the optimal process to identify recommendations with quality indicator development potential).<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>The final clinical assessment of feasibility and validity was based on a method devised by the RAND organisation (the most widely used methodology to generate professional consensus on quality indicators).<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The panel (<italic>n</italic> = 13, 10 at final meeting) was of similar composition to that which participated in the nominal group technique rating, with some overlap in membership.

The nominal group discussion identified six broad clinical areas in which development of quality was agreed to be important. Three focused on clinical management of illness (early recognition of serious illness, management of common conditions, and mental health) and three on more generic aspects of child care (child protection, health promotion, and governance). The governance issues ranged from illness specific (for example, unnecessary admission of children to hospital with acute asthma) to standards of professional development (for example, review of paediatric-specific skills in annual appraisal).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold><italic>Outcome of development process.</italic></bold></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bjgpDec-2014-64-629-e752"/></fig></sec><sec><title>National guideline review</title><p>Review of the 296 national guidelines identified 48 (37 NICE and 11 SIGN) relevant to children or adolescents, containing 1863 potentially relevant recommendations. However, only 123 (6.6%) met all five selection criteria and these were taken forward for translation into quality indicators. Most of these recommendations were about clinical management of illness (33 early recognition of serious illness; 51 management of common conditions; 28 mental health). Only three recommendations selected were about child protection, eight about health promotion, and none about governance.</p></sec><sec><title>Articulation and assessment of indicators</title><p>The 123 recommendations were translated into 56 quality indicators; this reduction mainly reflected overlap (that is, more than one recommendation could be addressed by a single indicator). However, the process of identifying exemplar indicators from other sources not only facilitated drafting but also identified indicators for the generic aspects of clinical care not covered by guideline recommendations. A further 11 indicators were added through this mechanism (seven relating to governance, two each relating to health promotion and child protection) and two articulated by panel members during the final assessment phase. A total of 69 potential quality indicators were therefore included in the final assessment of feasibility and validity, of which 35 achieved a median score of &#x02265;8. Of these 35 indicators, 28 were rated as GRADE 1 (expert consensus) while four were rated 2 (low level of evidence), one was rated 3 (moderate level of evidence) and two were rated 4 (high level of evidence).</p></sec><sec><title>Quality indicators for routine care</title><p><xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box2">Box 2</xref> shows the indicators relating to the quality of routine clinical care. Most cover common conditions seen mainly in pre-school children including acute infection, acute diarrhoea, and allergic reactions. Four indicators relate to more specific age groups: neonatal jaundice, infant colic, and adolescent self-harm. Of the three indicators that are not focused on specific conditions, two are process measures (professional development and the availability of equipment) but one is a health service outcome measure: the number of accident and emergency attendances by children registered with the practice. The panel recognised that this would need to be standardised for other factors such as the age profile of the child population and the practice deprivation index as both will influence accident and emergency attendance rates.</p><boxed-text id="box2" position="float"><label>Box 2.</label><caption><title>Indicators of the quality of routine clinical care</title></caption><table-wrap id="d35e358" position="anchor"><table frame="below" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Acute infections</bold></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Antibiotic prescriptions in children should be accompanied by a clearly documented rationale for this decision</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Acute diarrhoea</bold></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Children &#x02264;5 years with gastroenteritis should have hydration status clearly documented</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Allergic reactions</bold></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Children with an acute allergic reaction to a food substance should be referred for appropriate investigations</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Enuresis</bold></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

It took 2 years to produce 35 indicators that have high levels of clinical support and reflect national guidelines. These indicators were developed by a multi-step method very similar to that used in formulating the QOF. They cover a range of clinical issues agreed to be of importance to high-quality primary care for children and adolescents. However, there are many important aspects of care that are not covered and most indicators are supported only by low-level evidence (mainly expert opinion). They need to be piloted before large scale implementation to check for unforeseen difficulties in use and adverse consequences but they do fill an important gap. Lack of a set of quality indicators is no longer an excuse for the omission of markers of paediatric care from the QOF.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The main strength of the research undertaken was that it followed a well-defined multi-step process that has been developed and refined by others. As stated in the methods, the nominal group technique was used by Guttmann <italic>et al</italic>, in defining important clinical areas in which to develop quality indicators for emergency paediatric care in Canada.<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The RAND appropriateness method, developed in North America, is now a core feature of the process of development of quality indicators for the UK QOF.<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The initial assessment of the most important areas in which to develop quality indicators was informed by research (a qualitative survey of service GPs<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and an analysis of emergency hospital admissions).<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Every attempt was made to ensure the indicators were evidence based (by basing the initial drafting on national clinical guidelines prepared by NICE).</p><p>The main weakness of the process was that the only stakeholders consulted were GPs. This approach was taken because the initial implementation concern was professional acceptability. In the UK, paediatric care is provided by the whole primary care team, with health visitors in particular playing an important role in promoting child health, safeguarding children, and supporting families of children aged &#x0003c;5 years. If the process was repeated it would involve other primary care clinicians (for example nurses or health visitors) in the expert panels and consultation with other stakeholders (for example, parents, hospital and community paediatricians, or health service commissioners). Limiting the process to clinicians with a professional and financial interest in the outcome has the obvious potential to influence both the areas chosen as important for development and the assessment of validity and feasibility.</p><p>The study departed from a strict application of the consensus method by including indicators in the final set based on their median rating for validity and implementation even if complete consensus was not achieved. The authors believe that seeking complete consensus risks a &#x02018;lowest common denominator&#x02019; effect, with the exclusion of otherwise highly-rated indicators because they were opposed by one or two individuals with a strong contrary opinion. For example, &#x02018;children with atopic eczema should be prescribed emollients&#x02019; achieved median ratings of 8 and 9 but would have been rejected because one panel member gave a 2 rating for both feasibility and validity.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with existing literature</title><p>Most of the previously developed paediatric quality indicators focus on care of acute illness (for example, diabetic ketoacidosis, status asthmaticus, anaphylaxis, status epilepticus, severe head injury, and sepsis).<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The quality indicators used to assess the care of children in the US Medicaid programme looked at primary care but focused on vaccination, access, and procedures.<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The set of paediatric quality indicators developed by Giesen in the Netherlands also focused on primary care and used a very similar approach of developing indicators based on national guidelines but focused only on prescribing and referral out-of-hours.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The most inclusive set of primary care quality indicators for children and adolescents was developed in the US by Mangione-Smith <italic>et al</italic> in 2007 using the RAND methodology, but it involves 175 indicators (covering management of acne, ADHD, allergic rhinitis, asthma, depression, diarrhoea, fever, urinary tract infection, and sexually transmitted Infections as well as prevention and care of well children) and is more useful for one-off surveys of care quality rather than routine monitoring and quality assurance.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>There is some overlap between our work and the quality standards that NICE are starting to publish, some of which apply to children.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> For example, the NICE standard for primary care of epilepsy is that &#x02018;Children and young people presenting with a suspected seizure are seen by a specialist in the diagnosis and management of the epilepsies within 2 weeks of presentation.&#x02019; This study&#x02019;s comparative indicator is formulated more precisely in terms of the children who needed to be referred but it is less precise on timing: &#x02018;Children with a first non-febrile seizure should have clearly documented evidence of referral to secondary care for further assessment.&#x02019;<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>The varying language in which our indicators are expressed highlights the overlap between the concepts of a quality indicator and quality standard. Some are expressed as true indicators without any predefined standard (for example, accident and emergency attendances for children in previous 12-month period) while others imply a zero-tolerance standard (for example, infants with colic should not be prescribed dicyclomine). In order to apply the indicators in clinical practice it is necessary to set a standard (that is, the level which must be achieved) but it should be noted that QOF indicators seldom set a zero-tolerance standard: full points are awarded for less than 100% compliance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Implications for research and practice</title><p>The most striking feature of the selected indicators is their low GRADE scores: the evidence base appears weak. This is in contrast to the reported evidence base for the quality of acute hospital-based paediatric care reported by Stang <italic>et al</italic> where 37% per cent of the selected indicators are based on moderate or high-quality evidence.<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> To some extent this must reflect a lack of evidence about the optimal way of providing high-quality primary care to children; it also reflects the failure to select indicators from areas of care where the evidence is strongest (for example, vaccination). And perhaps it also reflects the nature of much of the existing evidence base with its focus on the absolute effectiveness of drugs and procedures rather than the optimal mechanism of their use (for example, when, to whom, and how much medicine is given).</p><p>Experience of the QOF in the UK has highlighted the importance of pilot-testing quality indicators before wide-scale national roll-out.<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The target population has to be carefully defined, precise coding developed to extract reliable information from computerised records, and the potential for gaming and the generation of unexpected adverse outcomes assessed. But it is important that care quality for children and adolescents is not ignored. Also, it is important that auditable quality indicators cover the full range of care. The indicator set that has been developed here reflects professional concerns and existing guidelines. In the UK it would be implementable through computerised audit of existing primary care records, whether or not it was used just as an audit tool or linked to QOF payment by results. So while the indicator set is not perfect, it is a start and improvement is most likely if it is taken up and used.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all the members of the panel, specifically Dr Janice Allister, Dr Chris Boardman, Dr James Cave, Dr Dick Churchill, Dr Duncan Keeley, Dr Maeve Lambe, Dr Tonia Myers, Prof Ed Peile, Dr Phil Rayner, Dr Peter Saul, Dr Clare Taylor, Dr Faye McCleery, and Dr David Jones.

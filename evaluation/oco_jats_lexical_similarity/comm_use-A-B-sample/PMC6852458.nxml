occupying a noticeable place among the candidates for residency in the specialty, who
were competing among the best brains of universities.</p><p>The characteristics of the surgical procedure required highly capable professionals, from
a technical and tactical point of view, in a challenging environment in which patients&#x02019;
lives were artificially maintained by equipment with highly complex technology that
incorporated the most advanced knowledge about physiology and homeostasis of cell
metabolism<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The knowledge about physiology was tested in each intervention, forcing the professional
to know deeply the functioning of the circulatory system and the organism entirely.</p><p>Each successful operation was a rewarding victory for the surgeon to such an extent that
one of the most brilliant pioneers of the specialty, Prof. Denton Cooley, at a
conference I attended, said that: Just the fact that the patient allowed himself to be
operated was already a great reward for the surgeon.</p><p>History began to change in 1978, when the radiologist and cardiologist Andreas
Gr&#x000fc;ntzig, or Andreas Gruentzig, assisted by an engineer, Heinrich Hopf,
miniaturized a balloon catheter, which allowed him to dilate stenosed coronary
arteries<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>This concept already existed, since Charles Dotter, along with Melvin Judkins, had
published in 1964, in the journal Circulation, the dilation of peripheral arteries by
the passage of coaxial catheters of progressive diameters, saving 11 patients with
obstruction of lower limb arteries from gangrene.</p><p>It was created the concept of &#x0201c;transluminal angioplasty&#x0201d;<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Surprisingly, due to complications at the beginning of the experiment, the procedure was
abandoned and much criticized in the United States of America, where Dr. Dotter was
nicknamed &#x0201c;crazy Charlie&#x0201d;<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Nevertheless, the concept of dilating arteries remained.</p><p>Dotter himself and other German surgeons, such as Dr. Eberhart Zeitler, have considered
using inflatable balloons to compress atherosclerotic plaques.</p><p>The balloons already existed, because an American, Dr. Thomas Fogarty, had created a
catheter with a balloon to perform embolectomies<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>This was the status of the treatment of arterial obstruction, when a charismatic figure
emerged, which would revolutionize the treatment of coronary artery obstruction.</p><p>It was a &#x0201c;disruptive technology&#x0201d;.</p><p>Myocardial revascularization, which represented about 50% of the cardiac surgeon&#x02019;s work,
started to compete with a less aggressive technique performed by a simple incision or
even a puncture of a peripheral artery, without the need for anesthesia or transthoracic
incision and extracorporeal circulation for saphenous vein grafts, mammary artery
anastomoses, or other arterial grafts, to the coronary vessels, bypassing the
obstructive lesions.</p><p>Gr&#x000fc;ntzig&#x02019;s coronary angioplasty evolved into new variants with the introduction of
&#x0201c;stents&#x0201d;, small metal structures introduced into the arteries by dilating them to avoid
restenoses, which frequently occurred after some time of dilation<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Stents kept being refined, and drug eluted to prevent cell proliferation that would cause
stenosis.</p><p>In 1999, pioneering in Brazil, Dr. Jos&#x000e9; Eduardo de Sousa<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>, at the Instituto Dante
Pazzanese de Cardiologia, implanted the first stent coated with an antiproliferative
drug, the sirolimus, and it was the first-in-man application worldwide.</p><p>These new classes of stents kept being improved, competing head-to-head with myocardial
revascularization operations.</p><p>The technology continues to evolve, because complications persist, and myocardial
revascularization is still the gold standard in more complex cases<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Dilation of stenosed coronary arteries with balloons was followed by implantation of
metallic stents to avoid frequent restenoses.</p><p>As the problem had not been solved, pharmacological stents, eluted with antiproliferative
drugs, were developed to increase patency in medium and long terms.</p><p>These procedures constitute what is conventionally defined as &#x0201c;disruptive
technology&#x0201d;.</p><p>&#x0201c;Disruptive technology is a term that describes technological innovation, with
characteristics that cause a disruption of established patterns, models, or
technologies&#x0201d;<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>That&#x02019;s how myocardial revascularization operations were being replaced by a new
procedure, without cardiovascular surgeons becoming aware that their work was being
threatened by a less invasive technique, assimilated by other professionals, and
preferred by patients<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>As quoted textually by Dunning<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>, in 2019, &#x0201c;&#x02026;All these systems require general anesthesia
and we must learn the lessons of the cardiac surgeons who were slow to enter the
catheter labs and who lost the leadership in TAVI and revascularization.&#x0201d;.</p><p>To cite examples, I refer to the transcatheter valve implant, and its abbreviations
&#x0201c;TAVI&#x0201d; (transcatheter aortic valve implantation) and &#x0201c;TAVR&#x0201d; (transcatheter aortic valve
replacement)<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The replacement of heart valves was absolutely established with the operations,
extracorporeal circulation, and surgical replacement of stenosed, insufficient, or
double-injured valves by metallic or biological prostheses.</p><p>However, elderly patients with aortic valve stenosis posed a high risk for enduring a
conventional heart surgery in 2002.</p><p>In that year, Alain Cribier<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>, after studies on cadavers and animals, made the first
catheter aortic valve implantation, in the city of Rouen, in a patient with severe
calcified aortic stenosis, as a compassionate procedure, because of the critical
condition of the patient</p><p>A crimped (crushed) biological prosthesis on a balloon was used to dilate the stenosed
valve and at the same time to implant the valve inside the native valve, anchoring it
over the calcium deposits.</p><p>Some other cases were performed on other compassionate patients (almost dying), with
acceptable results.</p><p>Few people gave credit to this disruptive technique, not believing in its viability.</p><p>Dr. Alain Cribier himself came to me, at that time in the city of S&#x000e3;o Jose do Rio
Preto, so that he could develop a properly treated bovine pericardium valve inside the
support he had already developed.</p><p>At the time, I arranged a meeting between Dr. Cribier himself, the hemodynamicists Dr.
Moacir Godoy and Dr. Luiz Ant&#x000f4;nio Gubolino, and me, as a cardiovascular
surgeon.</p><p>Honestly, that technique did not impress us favorably.</p><p>To collaborate with the researcher at Braile Biom&#x000e9;dica&#x000ae;, it was developed a
valve suitable for the metallic support.</p><p>At the inventor&#x02019;s request, an engineer spent some time in the company to make sure of the
quality of the procedure.</p><p>That engineer started producing the valves herself in Canada. And I never heard from Dr.
Cribier again.</p><p>In 2004, a multinational industry bought the rights of the incipient industry led by Dr.
Alain Cribier.</p><p>Since then, hundreds of thousands of patients, currently even of medium or low risk, have
been treated by the new technique improved over time<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Another example, still under development, is the implantation of transcatheter valves for
mitral and tricuspid positions, a challenging field<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Besides that, there is another disruptive technology, widely developed, namely
valve-in-valve implants, which show consistent results in repairing damaged biological
valves, replacing reoperations with advantages.</p><p>Surgeons, as it is often the case with professionals who have preconceived ideas and are
developing their activity in a comfort zone, did not believe in the new techniques,
which developed vigorously, to the point of changing the concept of &#x0201c;heart surgeon&#x0201d;,
there being need for the advent of a new professional that I decided to call &#x0201c;new
cardiac surgeon&#x0201d;<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>This specialist should be able to maintain his/her classic activities, and also introduce
in his/her portfolio the new less invasive technologies.</p><p>Many of the operations to correct birth defects, such as atrial septal defect (ASD),
interventricular septal defect (VSD), pulmonary valve stenosis (PVE), closure of
persistent ductus arteriosus, and other cardiac defects, are gradually being treated by
little invasive techniques<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The &#x0201c;new cardiovascular surgeon&#x0201d; should have a more extensive education than that
provided by the established residency until a few years ago.</p><p>Kotsis et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>, in
2013, in their article &#x0201c;Application of See One, Do One, Teach One Concept in Surgical
Training&#x0201d;, state: &#x0201c;Residents must be encouraged and given the opportunities to learn and
improve upon their surgical skills by mentors who continue to improve upon their skills
as well. This can all be done in an environment that keeps patient safety at the
forefront&#x0201d;.</p><p>Vaughn A. Starnes, president of the American Association for Thoracic Surgery (AATS),
celebrating the significant date of the 100<sup>th</sup> Annual Meeting, reaffirms the
principles that guided its founding at the beginning of the last
century<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Build a resource that studies the disease and improves outcome measures.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Simplify data collection to improve the accuracy and quality of the data.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Serve all areas of the specialty, as well as multidisciplinary areas.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Give contributors access to their own data.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Provide a collaborative space for surgeons around the world to engage.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>I hope that cardiovascular surgeons and residents of cardiovascular surgery can
assimilate the messages specified here, expanding their knowledge for treatment of heart
disease patients, with all current and future techniques.</p></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brito</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Haddad Junior</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A formula&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o do conceito de homeostase por Walter

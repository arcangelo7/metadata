the difficulties associated with controlling their growth during cold storage
and the consequent negative effects upon fluid milk or dairy products. Among the
psychrotrophic bacteria, the genus <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> (represented
primarily by <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>) has been highlighted as the cause
of numerous defects in dairy products. In light of its perceived predominance,
this species has frequently been chosen as a model organism to assess the
effects of psychrotrophic bacteria on milk or to evaluate the efficacy of
control measures. However, recent findings derived from the application of
molecular biological techniques have exposed a number of deficiencies in our
knowledge of the biology of milk-associated psychrotrophs. Furthermore, it has
been revealed that microbe to microbe communication plays a significant role in
determining both the identities and the extent to which different groups of
microbes develop during cold storage. The application of molecular
identification methods has exposed errors in the classification of members of
the genus <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> isolated from cold stored milk and has
stimulated a reevaluation of the presumed status of <italic>P.
fluorescens</italic> as the predominant milk-associated psychrotrophic
species. This article presents a succinct review of data from studies on
psychrotrophic bacteria in milk, some of which contest established theories in
relation to the microbiology of cold stored raw milk, and poses the question:

that have the ability to grow at low temperatures but have optimal and maximal
growth temperatures above 15 and 20 &#x000b0;C, respectively (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Moyer and Morita, 2007</xref>). This characteristic makes these
microbes especially significant with regard to food spoilage and safety, given that
the storage of many foods at cold temperatures is a routine practice during
production, transportation, processing and post-purchase (<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">Beales, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Russell,
2002</xref>).</p><p>Raw milk provides a physicochemical environment that is favourable for the
multiplication of a broad spectrum of microorganisms, including a range of
psychrotrophic bacterial species (predominantly members of the genus
<italic>Pseudomonas</italic>) that contaminate milk during collection and/or
processing (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Mcphee and Griffiths, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Pinto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">S&#x000f8;rhaug and Stepaniak, 1997</xref>).</p><p>Although the pasteurisation of raw milk decreases its microbial load, the efficiency
of the process and the resulting quality of the dairy products are directly
influenced by the microbiological quality of the raw milk (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">N&#x000f6;rnberg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Rigorous hygiene
standards employed to reduce the possibility of exogenous contamination coupled with
low storage temperatures to control the growth of mesophilic organisms are essential
components of the microbial control strategies employed with raw fluid milk (<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">Barbano <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).
Approaches including enclosed pipeline milk systems, better sanitary design of
equipment, cleaner cows, and more effective "cleaning in place" coupled with the
rapid cooling of raw milk using in-line plate coolers prior to storage in bulk tanks
have been shown to reduce the growth of contaminating bacteria (<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">Barbano <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p>The presence and subsequent replication of populations of psychrotrophs may lead to
the spoilage of milk (<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">Beales, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">N&#x000f6;rnberg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Pinto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Because
the economic impact of this group of microbes upon the global dairy industry is
substantial, psychrotrophic bacteria have been and continue to be studied
extensively with the main objectives of developing effective control measures and
establishing regulations to ensure the quality and safety of milk and dairy products
(<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Mcphee and Griffiths, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Despite the existence of an extensive body of published data, based on the results of
recent studies it would be fair to state that numerous gaps exist in our
understanding of the biology of the psychrotrophic bacteria of importance for the
dairy industry. The continued development of molecular tools for bacterial
identification and their application to the analysis of microbial population
structures and ecology in milk and dairy products has revealed the presence of
psychrotrophic bacteria undetected by the use of traditional culture-based
approaches (<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">Almeida and Araujo, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Marchand <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009b</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Raats <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).
Similarly, molecular methods have highlighted discrepancies in the identification of
the psychrotrophic species associated with the spoilage of cold stored milk,
particularly with regard to the taxonomically complex genus
<italic>Pseudomonas</italic> (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Mcphee and
Griffiths, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The majority of studies on milk-associated psychrotrophs have focused on individual
isolates grown as planktonic cultures (readily culturable). However, there is an
increasing recognition that such approaches overlook potential interactions and
cross-talk between different species of psychrotrophic bacteria, many of which are
non-culturable, that are present within the biofilms that develop in milk storage
and processing environments and that may exert an influence on milk quality and
safety (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Cleto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>;
<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Marchand <italic>et al.</italic>,
2012</xref>).</p><p>This current mini-review sought to collate and evaluate the findings of recent
studies on psychrotrophic bacteria of importance to the dairy industry and to
demonstrate that the activities of psychrotrophic bacteria in milk are more
extensive and more complex than was previously thought.</p></sec><sec><title>Biochemical Basis for Psychrotrophic Growth</title><p>Temperatures influence bacterial growth rates by affecting the conformation of
cellular macromolecules and other constituents, thereby determining the rates of
intracellular enzymatic reactions that are crucial for viability (<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">Beales, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Fonseca
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Russell, 2002</xref>). Hence, the adaptation of the cell to low temperatures
requires enzymes that are active in this condition (<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">Chattopadhyay, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Under low temperature growth conditions psychrotrophic bacteria synthesise
phospholipids and neutral lipids containing increased proportions of unsaturated
fatty acids, resulting in a reduction in the melting point of the lipids. This
phenomenon serves to maintain their fluidity, thus allowing the continued
functionality, solute transport, secretion of extracellular enzymes and fluidity of
the membrane (<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">Beales, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Jay, 2005</xref>)</p><p>Indeed, transcriptomic analysis of <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic> strain KT2440
revealed that the expression of at least 266 genes (nearly 5% of the genome) was
modified during low temperature growth in comparison to cells grown at 30 &#x000b0;C.
Several of these changes seemed to be directed towards neutralising problems created
by low temperatures, such as increased protein misfolding, increased stability of
DNA/RNA secondary structures, reduced membrane fluidity and reduced growth rates
(<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Fonseca <italic>et al.</italic>,
2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Psychrotrophic Bacteria in Milk</title><p>Refrigeration alone or in combination with other methods such as the addition of
preservatives is the most commonly used means of preserving food, including milk and
dairy products (<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">Beales, 2004</xref>). The current
trend in the dairy industries is to reduce the frequency of milk collection; thus,
the refrigerated storage of milk has been lengthened from two to five days prior to
heat treatment (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">O'brien and Guinee, 2011</xref>).
This practice has been stimulated in part by a desire for a 5-day work week and in
response to a decreased milk supply at certain times of the year (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Mcphee and Griffiths, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The procedure of cooling and the subsequent refrigerated storage of raw milk
effectively controls the development of populations of mesophilic spoilage organisms
while at the same time providing a selective advantage for the growth of
psychrotrophic bacteria (<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">Barbano <italic>et
al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">De Jonghe
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Samarzija <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). According to <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">S&#x000f8;rhaug and Stepaniak (1997)</xref> and <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Mcphee and Griffiths (2011)</xref>, the cultivable
psychrotrophic bacteria in milk are represented predominantly by Gram-negative
genera including <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, <italic>Achromobacter</italic>,
<italic>Aeromonas</italic>, <italic>Serratia</italic>,
<italic>Alcaligenes</italic>, <italic>Chromobacterium</italic> and
<italic>Flavobacterium</italic> spp., and at much lower numbers by Gram-positive
genera including <italic>Bacillus</italic>, <italic>Clostridium</italic>,
<italic>Corynebacterium</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus, Lactobacillus</italic>
and <italic>Microbacterium</italic> spp.</p><p>Interestingly, milk freshly drawn from the udder often does not contain detectable
populations of culturable psychrotrophic bacteria. However, these populations
develop over time in virtually all cold stored raw milk, a feature that reduces the
normal refrigerated storage life to less than 5 d (<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Ma
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Mcphee
and Griffiths, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Raats <italic>et
al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). The average counts of psychrotrophic aerobic
bacteria in milk silos at several dairies in southwest Scotland were reported to be
1.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cfu mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. The majority of the bacteria present were
Pseudomonads (70.2%), but Enterobacteriaceae (7.7%), Gram-positive bacteria (6.9%),
and other Gram-negative, rod-shaped organisms were also isolated (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Mcphee and Griffiths, 2011</xref>). Following storage for a
further 48 h at 6 &#x000b0;C, the psychrotrophic counts increased by two log cycles to 1.3 &#x000d7;
10<sup>7</sup> cfu mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.</p><p>In addition to growing at low temperatures, a variety of psychrotrophic bacterial
species (primarily represented by pseudomonads) found in raw milk produce
heat-stable proteases (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>,
2007</xref>) and lipases (<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et
al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), generally during the late log or early
stationary growth phases when the cell density is high. Many of the produced enzymes
retain significant activity after pasteurisation (72&#x02013;75 &#x000b0;C/15&#x02013;20 s) and even UHT
treatment (130&#x02013;150 &#x000b0;C/2&#x02013;4 s), and may subsequently degrade proteins and fats present
in the processed products (<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">Barbano <italic>et
al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">De Jonghe
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Dunstall <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p><p>A reduction in cheese yield and tainting are the two most frequently reported
negative effects in cheese production that are attributed to psychrotrophic-derived
enzymes (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Mcphee and Griffiths, 2011</xref>). Less
frequently reported effects include the alteration of starter activity and/or growth
rates and rennet coagulation times (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Datta and Deeth,
2001</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Mankai <italic>et al.</italic>,
2012</xref>). Reduced yields in cheese production occur mainly because soluble
casein degradation products (peptides and amino acids) may be lost into the whey
instead of forming part of the curd (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Mcphee and
Griffiths, 2011</xref>). The tainting problems are due to the action of
proteases, which generate bitter flavours, and lipases, which hydrolyse milk fat
yielding free fatty acids (FFAS) and generate strong flavours that in the majority
of cases are considered undesirable (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Deeth,
2006</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Mankai <italic>et al.</italic>,
2012</xref>).</p><p>&#x02018;Age gelation' of UHT milk is an irreversible phenomenon characterised by a change in
the physical state that is manifested by a rise in viscosity of more than 10 mPa.S
(at 20 &#x000b0;C), followed by the formation of a gel and loss of fluidity (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Datta and Deeth, 2001</xref>). According to <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">S&#x000f8;rhaug and Stepaniak (1997)</xref>, a psychrotrophic population
of 5.5 log cfu mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in raw milk causes UHT milk gelation after 20 weeks
of storage, while populations between 6.9 and 7.2 logs will cause the same effect
between 2 and 10 weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Biofilm Formation</title><p>The procedures of cooling and refrigeration of milk are not guarantees of quality.
The first point of control is to ensure that raw milk is obtained under sanitary
conditions designed to minimise contamination (<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">Beales, 2004</xref>). The second point of control is dependent on the adequate
cleaning and disinfection of all of the equipment used for the collection,
transport, and storage of refrigerated raw milk. This step is necessary to prevent
fouling with milk film, which can support the growth of bacteria as multi-species
biofilms that represent a source of contamination for any subsequent batches of milk
(<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Mcphee and Griffiths, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Perin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Biofilms are surface-associated bacterial communities that are embedded in a matrix
of self-produced polymeric substances (EPSs) consisting of nucleic acids,
polysaccharides, lipids and proteins resulting from the successful attachment and
subsequent growth of microorganisms on a surface (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Marchand <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Toyofuku <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). In nature biofilms can be
composed of a single species, but more commonly they comprise a consortium of
species (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Skandamis and Nychas, 2012</xref>). The
critical stages for biofilm development are adherence, proliferation, and the
dispersion phases (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Li and Tian, 2012</xref>). Each
of these stages includes reinforcement by or modulation of the extracellular matrix.
However, the functionality of biofilms depends on a complex web of symbiotic
interactions and factors, including pH, nutrient availability, quorum sensing
molecules, the presence of organic and inorganic compounds and temperature (<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">Bai and Rai, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Oliveira <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Biofilms are the
predominant form of growth for bacteria in the majority of environments, including
food processing settings (<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">Bai and Rai, 2011</xref>;
<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Cleto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).
More recently, the production of spoiling enzymes by bacteria present in biofilms
has also been studied (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Teh <italic>et al.</italic>,
2014</xref>).</p><p>Many <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species utilise biofilm formation during plant
colonisation to enhance persistence, resulting in the production of a variety of
biofilm matrix molecules (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Mann and Wozniak,
2012</xref>). An intriguing feature of milk-spoiling
<italic>Pseudomonas</italic> recovered from biofilms is their ability to alter
phenotypes via the process of phase variation (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Marchand <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Through this process,
high-frequency phenotypic switching is mediated by mutation, reorganisation, or
modification of the genome (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Van Den Broek <italic>et
al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), contributing to the survival of the biofilm
population during environmental stresses such as temperature fluctuations and
frequent exposure to sanitizers during the cleaning of dairy processing and storage
equipment (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Marchand <italic>et al.</italic>,
2012</xref>). The limited experimental data generated to date indicates that the
traditional approach of studying milk spoilage organisms as planktonic monocultures
has most likely served to distort and misdirect our understanding of spoilage
processes <italic>in situ</italic>, and future studies would undoubtedly benefit
from experimental approaches designed to mimic the biofilms found in bulk storage
and processing systems.</p></sec><sec><title>Quorum Sensing and Metabolic Regulation</title><p>Bacteria communicate with each other using chemical signalling molecules when
specific cell densities are reached via a process termed quorum sensing (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Fuqua <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). As a
consequence of this process gene expression can either be activated or repressed,
and the behaviour of populations of single cells are synchronised in a manner
similar to multi-cellular organisms (<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">Bai and Rai,
2011</xref>; <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Smith <italic>et al.</italic>,
2004</xref>). Cell density-dependent signalling systems in bacteria control a
range of phenotypic traits, including biofilm development, bioluminescence, cell
differentiation, competence for DNA uptake, pigment production, conjugal plasmid
transfer, production of degradative extracellular enzymes, sporulation, toxin
production and virulence gene expression (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Lazdunski
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Li and
Tian, 2012</xref>).</p><p>N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) are quorum sensing signalling molecules that are
produced by a wide range of Gram-negative bacteria, including <italic>P.
fluorescens</italic> (<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">Cha <italic>et
al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et
al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). The production of various AHLs in both raw and
pasteurised milk by psychrotrophic <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp. indicates that
quorum sensing may play a role in the spoilage of milk and dairy products (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Pinto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).
Coincidentally, the production of extracellular proteases in <italic>P.
fluorescens</italic> is associated with the high cell density that is typically
encountered towards the end of the exponential phase of growth (<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">Bai and Rai, 2011</xref>). The stimulation of protease
production by milk-associated strains of <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> in response
to the addition of AHL has been reported (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Liu
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>); the authors concluded that the
spoiling ability of psychrotrophic <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> was correlated
with the ability to produce AHLs, which served to regulate the expression of
extracellular proteases.</p><p>In contrast, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>
(2006)</xref> demonstrated that AHLs did not act as regulators of proteolytic
activity during the spoilage of aerobically chill-stored proteinaceous raw foods
including milk. In a subsequent study, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Pinto
<italic>et al.</italic> (2010)</xref> did not detect AHL signals in the
supernatants of late-exponential or stationary phase broth cultures of <italic>P.
fluorescens</italic> strain 07A isolated from milk. The authors subsequently
added synthetic AHLs or bacterial extracts containing natural AHLs to O7A cultures
and found no evidence of effects upon either growth or proteolytic activity,
suggesting that quorum sensing (at least via AHLs) did not regulate protease
production in strain 07A.</p><p>The role of AHLs as promoters of biofilm formation in <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>
strain B52 cultures was investigated by <xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">Allison
<italic>et al.</italic> (1998)</xref>. The addition of
<italic>N</italic>-acyl-hexanoyl homoserine lactone to fresh growth medium enhanced
biofilm production in a manner similar to that observed when supernatants from 2 day
old cultures of B52 were employed as the initial growth medium. Interestingly,
analysis of the spent medium using an <italic>Agrobacter tumefaciens</italic>
indicator strain failed to detect AHLs. Nevertheless, the authors concluded that
<italic>P. fluorescens</italic> was capable of reacting to the presence of short
chain (C6) exogenous homoserines, and speculated that strain B52 produced its own
signalling molecule that likely possessed a longer (&#x0003e; C8) fatty acyl chain that
could not be detected in the <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> bioassay.</p><p>Although quorum sensing signalling molecules have been detected in cold stored milk
and milk derivatives, their exact role in the spoilage process is still not clear
and further work on this topic is clearly warranted (<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">Bai and Rai, 2011</xref>). Specifically, the topic of inter-species
communication via broad range signalling molecules (<italic>e.g.</italic>,
autoinducer AI-2 (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Skandamis and Nychas,
2012</xref>)) has received limited attention to date, but is thought to represent a
pivotal process in the development of multi-species biofilms and the coordinated
expression of spoilage enzymes (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Li and Tian,
2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>
<italic>Pseudomonas</italic> in Milk</title><p>The genus <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> is the most heterogeneous and ecologically
significant group of known bacteria. Owing to the fact that the nutritional
requirements of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp. are very simple, representatives
of the genus have been detected in virtually all natural habitats
(<italic>e.g.</italic>, soil, house dust, fresh water and clouds), and have also
been isolated from clinical instruments, aseptic solutions, cosmetics and medical
products (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Franzetti and Scarpellini, 2007</xref>).
As such, it is not surprising that members of the genus <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>
have long been recognised as the predominant group of psychrotrophic bacteria
recovered from spoiled refrigerated milk (<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">Chen
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Among the pseudomonads, <italic>P.
fluorescens</italic> is generally considered to be the principal spoilage agent
of stored milk (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Mcphee and Griffiths, 2011</xref>;
<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Munsch-Alatossava and Alatossava,
2006</xref>).</p><p>The efficient cold adaption of the psychrotrophic pseudomonads is believed to be
linked to the possession of elevated levels (between 59 to 72%) of unsaturated
lipids in their cell membranes that impart the ability to efficiently maintain
membrane functionality (specifically solute transport and the secretion of
extracellular enzymes) at refrigeration temperatures (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Fonseca <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Jay, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, these species are able to
proliferate in milk, an environment where the concentration of free iron is low, due
to the production of the diffusible fluorescent pigment pyoverdine, which acts as a
siderophore, allowing the bacteria to effectively sequester iron from lactoferrin
(<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Mcphee and Griffiths, 2011</xref>).</p><p>
<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">De Jonghe <italic>et al.</italic> (2011)</xref>
examined the growth of psychrotrophic pseudomonads in raw milk under conditions that
simulated prolonged storage (4 days on the farm, 8 hours in transport and 24 hours
of storage at the dairy plant) at suboptimal (6 &#x000b0;C) and optimal (4 &#x000b0;C) storage
temperatures. The numbers of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> were similar during the
first 72 h of storage at either temperature. However, by the end of the experiment,
a striking difference of 2 log cfu mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> was reported between the optimal
and suboptimal storage conditions. Moreover, <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> counts
reached the same levels as the total aerobic plate counts by the end of the
experiment (10<sup>6</sup> and 10<sup>8</sup> cfu mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for optimally and
sub-optimally cooled milk, respectively). Unfortunately, direct comparisons between
the work of <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">De Jonghe <italic>et al.</italic>
(2011)</xref> and similar studies (<italic>e.g.</italic>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Martin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>) are difficult to
perform due to methodological differences and the specific strains investigated. In
this context, the importance of the choice of strain was highlighted in the work of
<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Jaspe <italic>et al.</italic> (1995)</xref>,
which demonstrated that <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp. isolated from milk that
had been stored at 7 &#x000b0;C for three days grew ten times faster at 7 &#x000b0;C, had 1000-fold
more proteolytic activity, and were 280-fold more lipolytic than
<italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp. isolated from freshly drawn milk.</p><p>Phenotypic analysis of microorganisms isolated from raw milk by <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Mcphee and Griffiths (2011)</xref> demonstrated that <italic>P.
fluorescens</italic> biovar I (32.1% of isolates), <italic>P. fragi</italic>
(29.6%), <italic>P. lundensis</italic> (19.8%), and <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>
biovar III (17.3%) were the most commonly isolated species, while <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Marchand <italic>et al.</italic> (2009a)</xref> demonstrated
that <italic>P. lundensis</italic> and <italic>P. fragi</italic> were the
predominant milk spoilers in Belgian raw milk samples.</p><p>Similarly, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">He <italic>et al.</italic> (2009)</xref>
found that pseudomonads predominated in cold stored pasteurised milk at 10 and 5
days before expiration as well as on the expiration day, although they also detected
significant numbers of <italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp. and
<italic>Buttiauxella</italic> spp. in all samples. Pseudomonads also
predominated in the microbiota cultured from the crevices of cleaned devices sampled
at a milk processing plant, demonstrating their potential roles as post-collection
contaminants (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Cleto <italic>et al.</italic>,
2012</xref>). The ability of this group of microbes to resist cleaning is linked
to the fact that many species are effective biofilm producers (<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">Bai and Rai, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Sim&#x000f5;es
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). The complex and multi-layered
structures of biofilms allow the bacterial communities to live in a sessile and
protected environment. Yet, when population densities in the biofilms become high,
bacteria are released into the environment, providing a continuous source of
planktonic bacteria capable of replication within milk (<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">Bai and Rai, 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>
<italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp.: Misidentification</title><p>A study of raw milk samples obtained along the cold chain of milk transportation
(from farm, trucks, and silos) in Finland demonstrated that the majority (88%) of
the isolated bacteria were psychrotrophic (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Munsch-Alatossava and Alatossava, 2006</xref>). The authors employed two
commercial phenotypic identification systems (API-20NE and BIOLOG GN2) and reported
difficulties in obtaining confident identification of many of the isolates. This was
particularly the case for fluorescent pigment-producing pseudomonads, where the
biochemical results were considered to be doubtful. In view of this controversy, the
authors recommended the use of genotypic identification systems in future
studies.</p><p>A comparative evaluation of phenotypic and genotypic methods for the identification
of 102 food-associated psychrotrophic <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp. clearly
demonstrated that molecular methods provided superior results (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Franzetti and Scarpellini, 2007</xref>). In this study,
phenotypic data identified the bacteria as <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> or
<italic>P. putida,</italic> with a single strain identified as <italic>P.
aeruginosa</italic>. In contrast, sequencing of 16S rDNA in combination with
restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses resulted in the
identification of the bacteria as <italic>P. jessenii</italic>, <italic>P.
orientalis</italic>, <italic>P. migulae</italic> and <italic>P.
chicorii,</italic> and also confirmed the phenotypic data for the <italic>P.
aeruginosa</italic> isolate.</p><p>The study of <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Hantsis-Zacharov and Halpern
(2007)</xref> evaluated 264 bacteria collected from raw milk during different

(<italic>Gammaproteobacteria</italic>, <italic>Bacilli</italic>,
<italic>Actinobacteria</italic>, <italic>Alphaproteobacteria</italic>,
<italic>Betaproteobacteria</italic>, <italic>Flavobacteria</italic> and
<italic>Sphingobacteria</italic>), with 20% of the isolates considered to be
novel species. <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> were
recorded as the predominant genera among the Gram-negatives, with 33 and 29
isolates, respectively. Sequencing of the gene encoding 16S rRNA identified the
majority (15) of the isolates as <italic>P. putida</italic>, and demonstrated the

<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Marchand <italic>et al.</italic> (2009a)</xref>
employed a polyphasic approach including molecular methods for the identification of
the predominant producers of heat-resistant proteases in raw milk in Belgium.
<italic>P. fragi</italic> and <italic>P. lundensis</italic> represented 53% of
the producers of heat-resistant proteases, with <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>
representing a minority of the isolates. The authors recommended the increased
application of genotypic identification methods to ensure accuracy, and they also
called for a revision of the taxonomic status of <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>.
Furthermore, they considered it likely that misidentification of many proteolytic
isolates as <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> in earlier studies using phenotypic
characterisation had led to an overestimation of the importance of this species as a
milk spoiler.</p><p>A further example of the difficulties associated with the identification of milk
spoiling <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species was provided by the study of <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Corr&#x000ea;a <italic>et al.</italic> (2011)</xref>. Using
phenotypic methods, the authors identified the highly proteolytic
<italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strain 1A4R as either <italic>P. asplenii</italic>
or <italic>P. jenssenii</italic>. The subsequent application of 16S rDNA sequencing
revealed a level of 99% nucleotide sequence homology with <italic>P.
koreensis</italic>, which forms part of the so-called <italic>P.
jenssenii</italic> group. In view of the divergent data, strain 1A4R was
classified as a <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp. belonging to the <italic>P.
jenssenii</italic> group.</p><p>Improvements in identification at the species and sub-species levels should become
possible through the use of highly specific typing methods such as the Multilocus
Sequence Typing (MLST) scheme developed by <xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">Andreani
<italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref> for the characterisation of the
<italic>P. fluorescens</italic> group. However, it should be noted that the
elevated costs of such sequencing-based methods is likely to limit their use, at
least in the short term, to academic studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Use of Molecular Tools to Elucidate the Ecology of Psychrotrophic
Bacteria</title><p>Indigenous bacterial communities in raw milk, including potentially lipolytic and
proteolytic psychrotrophs, are already present when the milk arrives at the dairy
plant, making the rapid and accurate identification of the raw milk microbiota a
necessary prerequisite for the elaboration of methods to circumvent spoilage (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Van Der Vossen and Hofstra, 1996</xref>). Based on the
observation that initial psychrotrophic counts of milk are frequently very low
(<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Mcphee and Griffiths, 2011</xref>), more
sensitive and efficient methods to evaluate the bacterial quality of raw milk are
required to identify the causes of reduced shelf life and the deterioration of
technological properties of milk during storage (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Quigley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Traditional microbiological approaches to the study of psychrotrophs in milk based on
phenotypic characterisation are time consuming, lack discriminatory power and
sensitivity and are often ineffective in establishing a causal relationship between
the contamination of the finished product and the environmental source (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Dogan and Boor, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Rasolofo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, the
inability to discriminate between closely related organisms can lead to
misidentification, and the slow turnaround time of the results makes phenotypic
testing useful mainly for retrospective evaluation (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Ercolini, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Raats <italic>et
al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Molecular analyses of microbes offer some advantages over phenotypic methods,
including speed and the ability to provide precise identification of microorganisms
from the genus to the strain level, depending on the system used. The discrimination
between subspecies and strains is helpful for investigating the routes and sources
of contamination (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Ercolini, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Rasolofo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>).
Molecular methods can be culture-dependent (nucleic acids are recovered from
cultured microbes) or culture-independent (total bacterial DNA/RNA is extracted
directly from an environmental sample, thereby providing information for the
components of the microbiota that are unable to grow under laboratory conditions)
(<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Ercolini, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Ercolini, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Quigley
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Raats
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The concept of viable but non-culturable (VBNC) bacteria refers to bacteria with
metabolic activity and the ability to reproduce under suitable conditions, but which
lack the capability to produce visible growth under standard conditions. Interest in
the role of VBNC in food spoilage has increased due to the observation that some
disinfection procedures such as pasteurisation of milk and chlorination of water can
cause bacteria to switch to the VBNC form (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Ozcakir,
2007</xref>).</p><p>High-throughput sequencing of 16S rDNA and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis
were used in combination with flow cytometry to examine the microbial content of raw
and pasteurised cow milk (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Quigley <italic>et
al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). In contrast to findings from culture-based
studies (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Ranieri <italic>et al.</italic>,
2009</xref>), the use of culture-independent methods demonstrated that the
pasteurisation process resulted in an overall reduction in the number of
pseudomonads rather than their complete elimination. Interestingly, the presence of
pseudomonads in pasteurised milk has traditionally been considered to be the result
of post-pasteurisation contamination (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Van Tassell
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). However, it is worth considering that
the survival and subsequent transition from VBNC to fully viable cells may explain,
at least in part, the frequent isolation of this genus from pasteurised milk.</p><p>
<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Quigley <italic>et al.</italic> (2011)</xref>
recently reviewed several culture-dependent and -independent methods applicable to
milk and cheese. Among the culture-independent methods, denaturing gradient gel
electrophoresis (DGGE) based on the separation of complex mixtures of PCR amplicons
of the same size but with different nucleotide sequences has emerged as the most
commonly used fingerprinting technique applied to the study of populations of
psychrotrophic bacteria associated with milk and dairy products (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Ercolini, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Raats
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Rasolofo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). This technology provides a
convenient means to obtain a comprehensive overview of the microbial populations in
milk during cold storage, has confirmed the predominance of
<italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp. in pasteurised milk samples during their shelf
life and has revealed a greater level of species diversity among the pseudomonads
than had been previously indicated by culture-dependent methods (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">He <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Raats <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, the
application of DGGE to raw milk samples from three farm bulk tanks and three dairy
plant silo tanks in Israel clearly demonstrated that refrigeration served to reduce
the microbial diversity of raw milk, and showed that the predominance of
<italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species was actually the end result of complex
microbial successions that varied depending on the source of the milk (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Raats <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). In the
case of farm samples, Gram-positive bacteria represented by the classes
<italic>Actinobacteria</italic> and <italic>Bacilli</italic> predominated at the
time of collection and were gradually overgrown by <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>
species. In contrast, dairy plant tank samples were initially dominated by a variety
of Gram-negative bacteria belonging to the <italic>Gammaproteobacteria</italic>
class, with <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> species
predominating within 48 h of refrigeration (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Raats
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). The predominance of psychrotolerant
members of the class <italic>Actinobacter</italic> in the farm samples and their
presence at lower levels in the silo samples was in agreement with data from
DGGE-based examinations of raw milk samples in Canada (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Rasolofo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>) and of raw milk
and fresh curd used for Fontina cheese production in Italy (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Giannino <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Interestingly,
cultivable and milk-associated members of this class of bacteria were previously
reported to possess the ability to secrete heat-stable proteolytic and lipolytic
enzymes (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Hantsis-Zacharov and Halpern, 2007</xref>).
Hence, it is possible that these bacteria may play a role in the spoilage processes
during the early stages post-milk collection or may even be involved in the
degradation of proteins and fats present in processed dairy products.</p><p>An alternative molecular fingerprinting method called random amplified polymorphic
DNA-polymerase chain reaction (RAPD-PCR) was applied to 66 bacterial isolates from
cold stored raw milk prior to nucleotide sequence analysis of the gene encoding the
16S ribosomal RNA (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Ercolini <italic>et al.</italic>,
2009</xref>). In agreement with the results obtained with DGGE, this approach
identified <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp. as the most common contaminant, but
also identified <italic>Hafnia alvei</italic>, <italic>Serratia marcersens</italic>,
<italic>Citrobacter freundii</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> and
<italic>Lactococcus</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The role of pseudomonads and primarily <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> as the
predominant psychrotrophs associated with the spoilage of cold stored milk and
milk-derived products has been established through a long history of culture-based
studies. However, these types of studies are often limited to the phenotypic
characterisation of the most abundant isolates following their isolation as pure
cultures. The validity of this approach has been questioned by recent findings using
nucleotide sequence-based identification methods, which have shown that the
diversity of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species involved in milk spoilage is much
wider than was previously thought. Moreover, real time molecular analysis of
microbial communities has shown that psychrotrophic species other than
<italic>Pseudomonas</italic> predominate in milk during the early stages
post-collection, and that the activities of those communities may play a role in the
subsequent spoilage of milk.</p><p>The emergence of molecular methods has provided a new means with which to obtain an
accurate global view of the microbial communities in milk. The application of these
methods has revealed potential roles for genera other than
<italic>Pseudomonas</italic> as important agents of milk spoilage at
refrigeration temperatures. Moreover, it is likely that the mixed bacterial
populations that are often present in the form of biofilms collaborate in the
spoilage process via mechanisms based on quorum sensing. The practical implications
for these essentially preliminary findings have yet to be elucidated. However, it is
clear that the continued study of milk-associated psychrotrophs is required and
should be encouraged in order to enhance and improve existing control methods and to
help ensure the quality and safety of milk and milk-derived foodstuffs.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B01"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Allison</surname><given-names>DG</given-names></name><name><surname>Ruiz</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Sanjose</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><year>1998</year><article-title>Extracellular products as mediators of the formation and

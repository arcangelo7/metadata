This longitudinal study of children and adolescents aimed to use the ecological model of physical activity to assess changes in barriers to participation in sports clubs to identify age-specific and weight-specific targets for intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Longitudinal study&#x02014;Perceived barriers to sports participation were collected from a birth cohort, the Gateshead Millennium Study (n&#x0003e;500) at ages 9 and 12&#x02005;years. The open-ended question &#x02018;Do you find it hard to take part in sports clubs for any reason?&#x02019; was completed with free text and analysed using content analysis, and the social&#x02013;ecological model of physical activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Barriers from across the social-ecological model were reported. Barriers at 9&#x02005;years were predominantly of a physical environmental nature, and required high parental involvement (for transport, money, permission), or were associated with a lack of suitable clubs. At 12&#x02005;years, perceived barriers were predominantly classed as intrapersonal (&#x02018;they're boring&#x02019;) or social environmental (&#x02018;my friends don't go&#x02019;). Perceived barriers were not associated with weight status.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Perceived barriers to sports participation change rapidly in childhood and adolescence. Future interventions aiming to increase sports participation in children and adolescents should target specific age groups, should consider the rapid changes which occur in adolescence, and aim to address prominent barriers from across the socioecological model. Perceived barriers may be unrelated to current weight status, allowing for more inclusive solutions.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Sports</kwd><kwd>Children's health and exercise</kwd><kwd>Adolescent</kwd><kwd>Epidemiology</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>What are the new findings</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Children's perceived barriers to sport participation change over a short space of time.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Perceived barriers may be unrelated to weight status.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Perceived barriers may be similar for boys and girls before adolescence.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Physical activity has been associated with numerous health benefits during childhood and adolescence.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Sport is one of the most popular forms of physical activity worldwide,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> it contributes 55&#x02013;65% of daily moderate to vigorous energy expenditure in youth,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>

<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Much of the current research focuses on reasons for participation and dropout.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;13</xref> However, the understanding of barriers preventing participation from the child or adolescent's perspective is important. The ecological model of health behaviour was developed to &#x02018;emphasize the environmental and policy concepts of behaviour, while incorporating social and psychological influences&#x02019;.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The social&#x02013;ecological model of physical activity (EMPA) was developed from this, and &#x02018;portrays physical activity behaviour as being influenced by interplay between environmental settings and biological and psychological factors&#x02019;,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> providing a framework for designing and evaluating physical activity and other health-related behavioural interventions. The model comprises four main domains: intrapersonal (individual beliefs, knowledge, skills, age), social environment (relationships, culture, society), physical environmental (natural or man-made environments) and policy (legislation). Barriers to sports participation may fall into any of these domains. A review of the relatively small amount of research in the area found that adolescents perceived social and intrapersonal factors to be the most prominent barriers to sports participation.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> However, these studies involved cross-sectional research designs, and there is no research into how perceived barriers to participation change over time in the same children, and data on children's barriers (rather than adolescents&#x02019;) is lacking.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Barriers would be expected to change as children develop both physically and socially; what they gain in motor skills and sports knowledge<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> may be tempered by a new awareness of social standing and peer influence.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>In our recent prospective study in an English birth cohort,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> continued participation in sports clubs between the ages of 9 and 12&#x02005;years was associated with decreased adiposity. This finding is particularly important given the high prevalence of obesity and associated negative outcomes among youth.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Additionally, this finding suggests that individuals with increased adiposity may be less likely to participate in sports, and body-related or social barriers may be particularly prominent in this group.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Similar barriers may be more evident among females,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> as girls and young women are less physically active and take part in less sport than their male peers.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>The novel aim of this study was to investigate how perceived barriers to participation in school and outside-school sports clubs change in the same cohort over 3&#x02005;years. This information would allow interventions to be tailored to the specific needs of children and adolescents at a time of high risk of dropout. Three main hypotheses were tested: (1) perceived barriers will change from 9 to 12&#x02005;years; (2) overweight children will perceive different barriers to children of healthy weight and (3) girls will perceive different barriers than boys.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Sample</title><p>The Gateshead Millennium Study is a birth cohort of adolescents born in northeast England between June 1999 and May 2000.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Briefly, all children born to Gateshead-resident mothers in 34 prespecified recruiting weeks were invited to participate with no exclusion criteria. In total, 1029 babies were recruited to the original cohort, 523 male (50.8%) 506 female (49.2%) predominantly from the white ethnic majority (98%). The metropolitan borough of Gateshead is a mix of urban and rural, and the northeast of England is more deprived than England in general.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The sample has remained socioeconomically representative of northern England and stable throughout the study; at birth, 15% of the sample was in the most affluent quintile, 20% in the second most affluent quintile, then 23%, 22% and finally 19% of the sample in the least affluent quintile.

The responses were analysed using content analysis using an inductive thematic approach: the answer was read and the &#x02018;theme&#x02019; or &#x02018;subdomain&#x02019; associated with it was created. For example, the answer &#x02018;I don't take part in any outside school clubs, because none of my friends do&#x02019;, was used to create a subdomain of &#x02018;friends don't go&#x02019;, other similar responses were then placed into this category. Subdomains were then grouped thematically according to a simplified version of EMPA<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> that consisted of three main domains: physical environmental, intrapersonal and social environment. A cumulative EMPA count was created for each domain of EMPA. A response could be placed into more than one category of EMPA if it included more than one factor.

By adolescence, the respondents showed a marked change in their responses, with answers predominantly intrapersonal and socially environmental, and displaying a general lack of interest: &#x02018;because &#x02026; I can't be bothered to stay after school&#x02019; (ID4, boy 12&#x02005;years), and having other interests and priorities, whether friends, family or homework: &#x02018;I always have a lot of things to do at break and lunch, and none of the after school clubs suit me&#x02019; (ID6, girl, 12&#x02005;years).</p><p>At both ages, there were children and adolescents describing themselves as &#x02018;not sporty&#x02019;, or disliking sports, and at 12&#x02005;years worrying about not fitting in: &#x02018;Sometimes I feel as if I won't fit in with others or maybe feel left out&#x02019; (ID7, boy, 12&#x02005;years), &#x02018;I don't feel comfortable and don't like doing things without my friends&#x02019; (ID8, girl, 12&#x02005;years), &#x02018;I am often very shy and rarely speak for myself. I am worried that I will get things mixed up so try to avoid things&#x02019; (ID9, girl, 12&#x02005;years).

The current work has also addressed an important gap in the literature by contributing to the knowledge of younger children's experiences.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Age-related changes</title><p>There was a clear difference with age; as children, the perceived barriers were predominantly of a physical environmental nature. This is in keeping with children of this age and stage of development; they are not yet overly concerned about their social standing,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and parental support is vital, as the children may be considered too young to travel home alone, do not have their own money (or parents cannot afford clubs/equipment), may forget to get permission forms completed, or are refused permission: &#x02018;[I would like to go] swimming&#x02014;Mum won't let me go back&#x02019; (ID 13, boy, 9&#x02005;years). Others have found that parental support, plus access to a variety of clubs, are motivators for young children's participation in sports.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> A lack of time was cited at both ages, and at 9&#x02005;years, this may have been due to homework or other clubs they enjoyed: &#x02018;[I would like to do] karate&#x02014;but clashes with piano lessons&#x02019; (ID 14, girl, 9&#x02005;years). Lack of time and competing demands were reported by Canadian parents of children this age,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> and children in Ireland who had never participated in sports clubs provided similar reasons; they struggled to find suitable clubs, with transport, and with feelings of incompetence.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Participants in the current study also reported that they &#x02018;weren't good at sport&#x02019;, or that it was &#x02018;too hard&#x02019;, and there were children with injuries, or who were scared of getting hurt. This could point to exposure to developmentally inappropriate sports,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> or that the children lacked the fundamental movement skills required to perform them. These could be difficult feelings to overcome, perhaps helped by improved teacher and coach training in understanding and assessing fundamental movement skills,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> and communicating their importance to parents.</p><p>The transition from primary to secondary school (and from childhood to adolescence), marked a clear distinction in barriers, with the most prominent subdomains capturing disinterest. Other researchers have emphasised the need for &#x02018;sampling&#x02019; at these ages, where children try different sports with an emphasis on fun and participation, rather than competition.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> In the current study, many children already participated in a sports club, perhaps explaining why many children did not perceive any barriers. However, several responses could be intervention targets, including providing transport home, making clubs free/cheaper, and making clubs available to children of all ages. The results of this study also suggest that interventions to increase sports participation should be age-specific. The 12-year-olds&#x02019; concerns relating to their social environment emphasise the importance of friendship groups at this age: &#x02018;I don't take part in any outside school clubs, because none of my friends do&#x02019; (ID15, girl, 12&#x02005;years). This emerges during early adolescence, as they become more aware of what their friends think of them, and the need to feel accepted and similar.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> This has been described in a dance intervention for girls<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>; the authors suggest emphasising enjoyment and socialisation in recruitment campaigns.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Peer acceptance and friendship quality are two important dimensions of peer influence that have been linked with increased commitment to sports, greater enjoyment, and improved psychosocial well-being among adolescents.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>

<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> highlighting a degree of generalisability of studies to this age group, enabling successful sports interventions developed in one setting to be applied more rapidly in others.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Weight-related and sex-related barriers</title><p>The analysis found no clear difference with overweight status, suggesting that children and young adolescents have similar concerns across the weight spectrum. This may help future intervention designs to be more inclusive and is consistent with the finding that there is no difference in participation in organised sports by weight status.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Similarly, sport participation has previously been shown to differ by SES,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> while other research has found that SES and cultural background, but not BMI, predict dropout from sport.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> There was also no clear association with sex, which is surprising, given that levels of physical activity and sports participation are lower in girls than boys. Allender <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> reviewed barriers reported by young women, however, few of them were replicated in the current study. This may reflect the younger age of the current participants, and that sports clubs at 9&#x02005;years may be available to both sexes. Further follow-up will show how perceived barriers change again.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Strengths include the relatively large sample size, with repeated assessment over 3&#x02005;years, across the key period of transitions from primary&#x02013;secondary school and childhood&#x02013;adolescence. The use of a simple tool to extract information could be perceived as a weakness, but the breadth of answers, and similarity with qualitative studies shows that a simple question could help to inform intervention design. Other limitations include a lack of representation from across the entire socioecological model; information on policy barriers was limited, but might have included &#x02018;lack of clubs&#x02019; or &#x02018;expense&#x02019;, however, more information would be required to decide that. An additional qualitative study with alternative methods, for example, interviews, might have revealed insights that were not possible from the current method. Additional information across the entire range of adolescence would also add value, therefore, it would be useful to follow the cohort further into adolescence and adulthood. Generalisability to other settings may be affected by the predominantly white ethnic background of the participants, and the low SES of the region; more affluent families or regions may have more clubs available to them.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Setting this research in context</title><p>The importance of sports participation throughout life is being recognised by individual governments and also internationally, by the WHO Europe network for health-enhancing physical activity (HEPA), The Association For International Sport for All (TAFISA) and the IOC. The recent report by the UK Government &#x02018;Sporting Future: A New Strategy for an Active Nation&#x02019;<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> promises a commitment to non-elite elite sport, and to increasing the funding and coaching available to children from 5&#x02005;years old, as well as encouraging sport for social and mental health benefits. The current study should feed into the knowledge base for those seeking to increase sports participation in children and adolescents, specifically by understanding the variety of barriers and pressures that children and young people face.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The transition from childhood to adolescence represents a marked change in perceived barriers to participation in sports clubs that may not differ substantially by sex or weight status. Interventions need to be tailored to the specific needs of the age group that is being targeted, and cover as many domains of the socioecological model as possible. Furthermore, interventions should address a narrow range of ages, because a universal intervention is unlikely to be applicable to both 9-year-olds and 12-year-olds. The views of children and adolescents should be sought prior to, and during, intervention design and implementation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors specially thank the Gateshead Millennium Study families and children for their participation in the study, and to the schools for their helpful cooperation.

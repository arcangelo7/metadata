ventricle aneurysms occur following ischemic heart diseases, particularly transmural
myocardial infarction. While they can occur immediately after acute myocardial
infarction, they can also arise weeks or months later and are frequently seen in the
anteroapical, apical and septal regions. Aneurysms occur in 3.5 to 38% of the cases
due to insufficient replacement of necrotic myocardial tissue after acute transmural
myocardial infarction with scar tissue in about six weeks<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. Aneurysm disrupts the
normal ellipsoid geometrical structure of the left ventricle (LV), leading to a
dilated spherical ventricle with limited contractility and filling
capacity<sup>[<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>. The clinical presentation is usually congestive
heart failure, <italic>angina pectoris</italic>, treatment-resistant ventricular
arrhythmias, and arterial embolization<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. The addition of coronary
revascularization to the surgical treatment of the LV aneurysms improves the
surgical outcome in these patients<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The main goal of surgery in the LV aneurysms is to remove the scar tissue to maintain
the normal filling volume and the geometric configuration of the ventricle, to
prevent excessive filling in the diastole, and to remove the contractile paradox
movement of the ventricle wall along the systole, thereby, fixing the function of
the LV<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The aim of this study was to compare surgical techniques in patients who underwent
ventricular aneurysm repair and/or myocardial revascularization, and to evaluate
early and late stage clinical outcomes of surgery with echocardiographic findings of
the LV.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>An approval was obtained from the local Ethics Committee for this study. A written
informed consent was obtained from each patient. The study was conducted in
accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>Surgical outcomes, pre- and postoperative clinical data and clinical outcomes at one
year after the procedure, and echocardiography results of 89 patients who underwent
post-infarction LV aneurysm repair and myocardial revascularization were
retrospectively analyzed based on the inpatient clinical follow-up results. Patients
underwent surgical techniques other than Dor procedure and linear repair were
excluded. All patients were evaluated in terms of age, sex, angina intensity,
functional capacity, LV ejection fraction (LVEF), number of coronary lesions,
aneurysm location, aneurysm repair technique, comorbidities and morbidity and
mortality rates. The outcomes of the applied ventricular aneurysm repair technique
were statistically analyzed.</p><p>Coronary artery stenosis and anatomy were evaluated using coronary angiography and a
coronary luminal stenosis &#x02265; 50% was considered significant, and bypass was
performed. Left ventricular reconstruction was performed with endoventricular
circular patch plasty (EVCPP) (Dor procedure) or linear repair technique. Pre- and
postoperative 1-, 2-, 6-, and 12-month clinical outcomes of the patients (mean:
12.9&#x000b1;3.8 months), echocardiographic LVEF measurements, end-systolic and
end-diastolic volumes and diameters were recorded. Based on the surgical technique
used, Dor procedure patients were assigned to group A (n = 48), while those who
underwent linear repair were assigned to group B (n = 41).</p><p>Angina intensity was based on the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS)
classification and functional capacity was based on the New York Heart Association
(NYHA) classification.</p><p>All patients were operated under general anesthesia (fentanyl, midazolam, sodium
thiopental, sevoflurane, lidocaine hydrochloride). In all patients, after induction
of anesthesia, a triple-lumen venous catheter was placed into the internal jugular
vein and electrocardiography (ECG) was performed; the patient was monitored for
systemic and central venous pressure. Routine median sternotomy was performed in all
patients. The left internal mammary artery (LIMA), the radial artery or saphenous
vein graft were used. In patients who did not required an additional surgical
procedure (<italic>i.e</italic>., valve replacement), aortocaval cannulation was
performed. Cardiopulmonary bypass was performed, and cross-clamp was placed. To
protect the myocardium, systemic and additional hypothermia was established with
cold crystalloid potassium cardioplegia. Reperfusions were performed with cold blood
cardioplegia every 20 min. Before opening the aortic clamp, reperfusion was
performed with low potassium warm blood cardioplegia. The patient's body temperature
was maintained between 28 and 32&#x000ba; C. Distal anastomoses of coronary lesions other
than LIMA to left anterior descending (LAD) artery anastomoses were completed.</p><p>The decision on which technique to use in the repair was based on the size of the
aneurysm during surgery and on the extent of the scar tissue. In the case of smaller
lesions without a marked aneurysmal sac, linear repair was preferred, whereas
endoaneurysmorrhaphy was performed in case of larger lesions with a marked neck and
fibrotic sac.</p><p>In patients who underwent surgery with the Dor technique, a vertical incision was
made in the anterior wall towards 2 to 3 cm lateral from the LAD artery to reach the
aneurysmal sac. Once the aneurysm was opened and the aneurysm wall and, if present,
the thrombus was removed, and a Dacron patch fitting to the alive and scar tissue
margins was prepared. After the diastolic volume was measured with a balloon, the
ventricular diastolic cavity was measured and the patch was implanted to the fibrous
tissue at the border using 3/0 propylene continuous suture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). The ventriculotomy margins on the ventricular wall
were closed using two Teflon felts 1 to 2 cm wide and 6 to 7 cm long and with 2/0
propylene to retrace all layers. In patients who underwent surgery with linear
repair technique, the aneurysmal sac was opened and the LAD artery was preserved
and, then the thrombus was removed, if present. While paying attention not to reduce
the ventricular cavity, the aneurysmal wall was resected to preserve the scar tissue
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). The aneurysmal tissue was
closed with 2/0 Ethicon U stitches reinforced by two long Teflon patches. Mannequin
balloon was used for measurement of the left ventricular volume in both groups. The
balloon was inserted into the left ventricular cavity and the left ventricular
balloon was inflated with normal saline as 40 cc/m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>

</p><p>Based on the hemodynamics of each patient, medical treatment was prescribed. An
intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was inserted in the patients with borderline
ventricular functions. Once the patients woke up after about 3 to 6 hours, they were
extubated on postoperative day 1 and were transferred to the ward on day 2. All
patients routinely received acetylsalicylic acid 300 mg and warfarin 5 mg. Dose
adjustment was made to maintain the International Normalized Ratio (INR) value
between 2 and 2.5. The patients discharged on days 7 to 10 were scheduled for
outpatient follow-up visits on day 10, at 1, 2, 6 and 12 months.</p><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 20.0 software (IBM Corp.,
Armonk, NY, USA). Descriptive data were expressed as arithmetic mean and
standard deviation. The independent Student's t-test was used to compare the
variables between groups. The echocardiographic results were compared using the
paired samples t-test. The Wilcoxon paired comparison test was used to compare
the pre- and postoperative angina intensity and functional capacity. A
<italic>P</italic> value of &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Of the patients in group A, eight (16.7%) were female and 40 (83.3%) male, while in

fibrillation usually developed within the first week of surgery. These patients were
referred for consultation to the cardiology department, and amiodarone infusion
followed by oral treatment was initiated. Cardioversion was performed in two
patients to restore normal sinus rhythm. Except one patient who underwent mitral
valve replacement with linear repair, all patients were in sinus rhythm during
follow-up, and amiodarone treatment was gradually discontinued. Hemodialysis was
also performed in two (5%) patients due to acute kidney failure with borderline
baseline creatinine values in the linear repair group. These patients did not
require dialysis during follow-up. The mean length of stay in the intensive care
unit was 2.7&#x000b1;1.7 (range: 1 to 13) days. In group A, 43 (90%) patients stayed

acute myocardial infarction<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>. These aneurysms involve all layers of the
ventricular wall, have well-defined borders without ability of contraction, contain
fibrotic and calcific tissues, are broad-based, contain 50% thrombus, and can be
rarely ruptured<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. The aneurysm can affect the neighboring normal
myocardium and cause irregularities in papillary muscles, thereby causing mitral
insufficiency. A mural thrombus is often found in the aneurysmal sac, however, the
frequency of clinically detected systemic embolisms is low
(2-5%)<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>. If aneurysmal tissue forms refractory, recurring,
and life-threatening arrhythmias in cooperation with the reentry currents at its
junction with the normal myocardium, surgical resection guided by
electrophysiological mapping should be preferred<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>. In patients with
symptomatic coronary artery disease, complete revascularization should be performed
to allow the recovery of the neighboring myocardium after restoration of ventricular
geometry<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Clinical outcomes of LV aneurysms vary depending on the amount of myocardium
affected, degree of ventricular distension, and accompanying coronary artery
disease<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>. While 5-year survival rate with medical treatment
is 8-12% in LV aneurysms, this rate can be increased from 75 to 90% with surgical
treatment<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Linear repair and Dor techniques, which are the two most frequently used techniques,
have advantages and disadvantages. It is reported that EVCPP technique (Dor
procedure) can be applied with low mortality (10%) in cases with akinetic myocardial
scar, significantly improves LV function, restores the shape and function of the LV,
and thus the outcomes of early and extended follow-up are
satisfactory<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. In the study by Shapira et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> in Dor procedure and linear repair technique, it
was reported that although both had similar effects on the LV geometry, the Dor
procedure caused a higher increase in the LVEF, improved long-term clinical recovery
and improved functional capacity.</p><p>In the present study, we evaluated the early clinical results and echocardiographic
measurements of the LV in patients who underwent LV aneurysm repair using two
different techniques along with myocardial revascularization. Both groups were
similar in terms of clinical characteristics, risk factors, indications for
operation and additional procedures.</p><p>In the study by Chen et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>, patient groups whose LV aneurysm repair was
performed using two different techniques were analyzed. There was a significant
improvement in the LVEF value in both groups. In the linear repair group, LVEF
increased from 26.3&#x000b1;9% to 28.3&#x000b1;7.5%, and in the Dor technique group,
the mean LVEF increased from 26.5&#x000b1;7.2% to 32.1&#x000b1;7.7%. Zheng et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>
also reported that the mean postoperative EF value increased more in patients who
underwent Dor procedure than patients who underwent linear repair. They suggested
that this was because Dor procedure preserved the conical shape of the LV and caused
a positive remodeling. In the study by Becit et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>, the mean preoperative
LVEF values in the Dor and linear repair groups were 0.30&#x000b1;0.06% and
0.31&#x000b1;0.07%, respectively, while during follow-up there was a significant
improvement to 0.44&#x000b1;0.04% and 0.41&#x000b1;0.04%, respectively. In our
patients, this value increased from 37.1&#x000b1;6.4% to 41.0&#x000b1;4.6% in the Dor
group (group A), and from 0.3&#x000b1;6.4% to 43.8&#x000b1;6.7% in the linear repair
group (group B). Echocardiographic studies also showed significant postoperative
improvement in LV functions in both groups. In particular, systolic functions of the
LV improved more in patients who underwent Dor procedure
(<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>The surgical indications for LV aneurysms are <italic>angina pectoris</italic>,
ventricular arrhythmias, dyspnea, and presence of systemic
embolism<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>. In our study, the primary indication for operation
was angina (CCS Class &#x0003e;II) in 88% of the patients, and dyspnea (NYHA functional
Class &#x02265;III) in 12% of the patients. Demirkilic et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> reported that the mean
functional capacity in the preoperative period was 2.2. In another study, Ismailoglu
et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>
reported that the mean postoperative NYHA regressed from 2.19&#x000b1;0.75 to
1.23&#x000b1;0.63, and the CCS value regressed from 3.05&#x000b1;1.05 to
1.07&#x000b1;0.27. In the study by Tavakoli et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>, the NYHA value
decreased from 2.9&#x000b1;1.0 to 1.9&#x000b1;0.4 in the Dor group, whereas it
decreased from 2.9&#x000b1;0.8 to 1.7&#x000b1;0.6 in the linear repair group.
Similarly, in our patients, the mean preoperative NYHA value was 2.5&#x000b1;0.6 and
regressed to 1.8&#x000b1;0.7 in group A and to 1.9&#x000b1;0.5 in group B
(<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). In addition, the CCS value of 3.0&#x000b1;0.8
regressed to 1.1&#x000b1;0.3 in group A and to 1.3&#x000b1;0.4 in group B
(<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). In all patients, a marked improvement in the
postoperative functional capacity and anginal symptoms was detected. However, in the
final visit, the NYHA functional capacity was improved in patients who underwent Dor
procedure (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). Kesler et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> evaluated these two
techniques in terms of the echocardiographic LV dimension and volume measurements
and reported that there were no statistical differences between the outcomes of
patch and linear aneurysm repair. In the study by Tavakoli et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>, both LVEDV and LVESV decreased at a similar rate
following surgery. In our study, the mean LVEDD decreased from 56.2&#x000b1;7.2 mm to
51&#x000b1;6.2 in group A and from 51.4&#x000b1;6.3 mm to 48.3&#x000b1;5.4 mm in group
B, and LVESD decreased from 41.4&#x000b1;6.4 mm to 37.7&#x000b1;5.9 mm in group A and
from 38.5&#x000b1;5.5 mm to 34.9&#x000b1;5.4 mm in group B. LVEDV regressed from
143&#x000b1;20.9 mL/m<sup>2</sup> to 86.6&#x000b1;21 mL/m<sup>2</sup> in group A, from
133.8&#x000b1;21.9 mL/m<sup>2</sup> to 78.3&#x000b1;14 mL/m<sup>2</sup> in group B,
while the end systolic volume regressed from 100.4&#x000b1;21 mL/m<sup>2</sup> to
58&#x000b1;1 mL/m<sup>2</sup> in group A, from 92.7&#x000b1;22.9 mL/m<sup>2</sup> to
53.4&#x000b1;8 mL/m<sup>2</sup> in group B, and no significant difference was
detected between the two groups.</p><p>Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is also an important component of the LV
aneurysm surgery, with a revascularization rate of 68 to 100% in the
literature<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>. Although myocardial revascularization is
controversial, many authors agree on the requirement of simultaneous CABG. With the
operation in which aneurysmectomy and CABG are performed simultaneously, mortality
decreased significantly and long-term survival increased. In the study by Mukaddirov
et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup>,
35% of patients underwent CABG and the mean bypass number was reported as 1.3 grafts
in each patient. In the study by Tavakoli et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>, CABG was performed in
addition to aneurysm repair in 84 patients (29 patients - 85% - in the Dor group and
55 patients - 90% - in the linear repair group). Erdil et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> also reported that the
multiple vascular coronary artery disease rate accompanying LV aneurysm was high at
75%. In our study, there were 57 (64%) patients with multiple vascular lesions. We
performed CABG in 94% of our patients with a mean graft number of 2.5&#x000b1;1.7. We
suggest that complete coronary revascularization with aneurysm surgery can
positively affect the long-term surgical outcomes and patients' quality of life.
Furthermore, in the early postoperative period, only three (3.3%) patients were lost
and only two (2.2%) died at one year of follow-up, and the absence of anginal pain
in 93% supports our hypothesis. Zheng et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> also showed that the IABP insertion
rate was 5.5% (n=8) in the Dor group and 4.8% (n=17) in the linear repair group,
indicating no significant difference between the groups. In our patients, the IABP
insertion rate was 12.5% (n=6) in group A and 5% (n=2) in group B.</p><p>Furthermore, independent determinant factors in the long-term survival were defined
as LV function, age, unstable angina, and previous history of cardiac surgery by
Carrel et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup>. Survival rates vary depending on parameters such
as sex, presence of diabetes, type and severity of symptoms, location of the
aneurysm, extent of coronary artery disease, and complete or incomplete
revascularization. It has been known that advanced age, history of ventricular
arrhythmia, triple vascular disease, weak LV formation and linear repair of the
aneurysm decrease long-term survival rates<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>. In the study by Silveira Filho et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup>,
the modified Dor procedure showed consistent LVEF improvements after long-term
follow-up. Survival was comparable for all ventricular types and for the modified
Dor and ventricular exclusion procedures. The EuroSCORE index is a useful index for
the late survival assessment of ventricular restoration techniques. In our study, in
the final visit, NYHA functional capacity was improved in patients who underwent Dor
procedure (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, the results of our study show that LV aneurysm repair can be performed
with low mortality and morbidity rates as an isolated CABG, yielding significant
improvement in hemodynamic functions compared to medical treatment. In addition,
post-infarction LV aneurysms can be repaired using both techniques with acceptable
surgical risk and satisfactory early and late stage outcomes, particularly in LV
systolic functions and functional capacity of the patient. These results also
indicate that if LV restoration is performed particularly with complete coronary
revascularization, regional afterload would reduce and ejection performance of the
non-infarcted myocardium and cardiac functions would be improved with a significant
recovery of the functional capacity.</p><table-wrap id="t7" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="10%" span="1"/><col width="90%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">UK</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Conception and design study; realization

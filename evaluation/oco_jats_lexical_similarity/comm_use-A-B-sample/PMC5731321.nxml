increase and may be responsible for 15% to 20% of all strokes in the elderly. In
this scenario, the left atrial appendage (LAA) thrombus would be associated with 90%
of cases, even considering the effective oral anticoagulants, they may be used only
in 40% to 50% of patients at stroke increased risk. Nowadays, the Watchman is the
only device approved in the United States. However, this approach includes at least
three unresolved issues: 1) Optimal patient selection criteria; 2) The devices role
in patients in whom anticoagulation is contraindicated; and 3) The novel oral
anticoagulants role <italic>versus</italic> the device not tested in randomized
trials<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. The left auricle
occlusion is adopted by all the current guidelines for the prevention of
thromboembolism and stroke, motivating the development of various percutaneous
devices occluders, and has been practiced since the 1930s<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>, even without evidence-based data in the form of
randomized controlled trials. Initially, LAA closure through excision or ligation
was performed in the context of open heart surgery or even during abdominal
surgeries. There are evidences that the LAA closure during routine cardiac surgery
is significantly associated with an increased risk of early postoperative AF.
However, remains uncertain whether the prophylactic exclusion is warranted for
stroke prevention during cardiac surgery. There are evidences that the LAA closure
during routine cardiac surgery is significantly associated with an increased risk of
early postoperative AF. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to focus basic
aspects for continuous medical education. In summary, the rationale of this text is
to emphasize anatomical and pharmacological aspects involved in the simple surgical
exclusion of LAA under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). There are several operative
techniques, but to conclude this revision it will present one of them based on the
discussed basic sciences, without considerer "stapling" devices which can be applied
from the outside surface of the heart.</p><p>For the review of the general aspects of the subject, the original text selected was
published by Holmes and Reddy<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>LEFT ATRIAL APPENDAGE ANATOMY</title><p>The publication chosen for the description of the LAA anatomy was signed by DeSimone
et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> from Mayo Clinic,
Rochester, MN, USA. The three-dimensional LAA morphology is, by itself, the
substrate for thrombus generation, and should be the subtract for embolism due to
its direct connection to the left-sided circulation. The LAA mesodermal justify its
exclusion from the atrial circulation and thereby can lead to a significant
reduction in stroke risk. This process also provides insight into the LAA as an
endocrine organ, its fluid homeostasis involvement, and its autonomic nervous system
connection. The surrounding LAA structural knowledge arrangement is critical to
identify the endocardial and epicardial landmarks perspective to improve devices
placement. Furthermore, correlation of the LAA body, neck, and ostium to the
surrounding anatomy can also improve both procedural safety and efficacy. Also, a
working knowledge of the regional anatomy adds a prudent degree of awareness for
procedural complications allowing for early identification and timely intervention.
A detailed understanding of the LAA morphology (embryology, histology, and gross
anatomy) is imperative to identify the individual approach for each
patient<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Cardiac structures are derived from the mesodermal layer during the third week of
embryonal development, when LAA originates and develops from the left side of the
primary left atrium. At around week six of embryologic life, further development of
the left atrium occurs around the six weeks, depending on the pulmonary system
growth and development, which connects to the heart via the pulmonary vein-left
sinus horn<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. The LAA is derived from the primary atrium left
the wall, during the fourth week of embryonic development, when has ultrastructural,
and physiological characteristics distinct from the left atrium<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The appendage is comprised of rigid pectinate muscles, in contrast to the rest of the
smooth left atrium, with thin-walled myocardium interdigitating these raised
regions. These pectinate structures are almost exclusively found in the LAA, in
comparison to the remainder of the left atrium, and these anatomical variations can
influence the exclusion procedures deserving to be reviewed: 1) The LAA pectinate
muscles; 2) The LAA variable morphology of its ostium shape and dimensions; and 3)
The LAA variable morphology and stroke risk<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>. All these factors
have been extensively studied resulting in great controversies.</p><p>Relevant LAA anatomic spatial relationships have to be emphasized since it is a
blind-ended pouch situated within the pericardium emerging from the left atria. The
anatomical relations are complex, and the critical structures surrounding the LAA
include: 1) The pulmonary artery superiorly directed; 2) The appendage tip pointing
inferomedialy oriented towards the left ventricle free wall; 3) The left phrenic
nerve running overtop of the appendage; 4) Fibers of Bachmann's bundle that approach
the LAA from the medial aspect of the atrial roof; 5) A posteriorly situated left
superior pulmonary vein; and 6) An inferiorly related mitral valve<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. However, of utmost importance to
note, when performing any LAA procedure, it is its critical relationship with the
area above the left atrioventricular groove, which houses both the left circumflex
artery and great cardiac vein (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="t1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Left atrial appendage anatomic relationships.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" style="background-color:#e6e7e8"><colgroup span="1"><col width="100%" span="1"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Relationship of the left circumflex artery to the LAA

heart. The endocardial endothelial cells (EECs) also constitute a very large contact
surface area that offers a very high ratio of cavity surface area to atrial volume,
a finding that suggests an important sensory role for the EE. These cells play the
role of a physic-chemical barrier between the cardiomyocytes and the circulating
blood<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>. Furthermore, just like other types of endothelial
cells, EECs release several factors such as nitric oxide (NO), angiotensin
II<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>, endothelin and
prostacyclin<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>To study the NO release from intact atrial endocardial endothelium, tube-shaped
sutures of canine atrial appendages were performed and effluents from these tubes
were bioassayed (isolated perfused organ chamber system) for detection of NO in the
canine coronary artery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). Effluent
from the right atrial appendage caused a relaxation of 58.4 &#x000b1; 10.1% and the
left atrial appendage 74.9 &#x000b1; 8.5% from the initial prostaglandin-F2&#x003b1;
contraction in the bioassayed coronary artery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure
2</xref>). This relaxation was abolished by treating the heart tubes with Triton
X-100 and reduced by treatment with L-NMMA, a competitive inhibitor of NO and with
indomethacin, an inhibitor of the cyclooxygenase pathway also indicating the release
of vasodilatory prostanoids from the endocardial endothelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). This study showed, for the first time, <italic>in
vitro</italic> luminal release of NO and prostacyclin from the canine heart
atrium. The ability of the EE to produce these factors could play an important role
in preventing thrombus formation in the cardiac chambers. In the present model, it
could not demonstrate a basal release of EDNO (<italic>i.e.</italic> release in the
absence of stimulation by an agonist from the intact atrium, as is typically present
in other vessels<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>

</p><p>Guazzi and Arena<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> focuses on the
evidence of an association of AF with endothelial dysfunction (ED) that increases
proinflammatory agents, oxidative stress and impairs NO-dependent vasorelaxation.
There are some evidences that AF is a risk factor for ED: 1) Reduced plasma
nitrite/nitrate levels impaired; 2) Increased blood flow acetylcholine-mediated; 3)
Impairment of flow-mediated dilatation by comorbidities; and 4) Efficacy of
cardioversion. Speculative mechanisms sustain the AF-ED association: 1) An impaired
rheology associated with AF induced by a non-pulsatile turbulent flow, which may
impair the NO synthase (eNOS) activation; 2) A disorganized atrial contraction
markedly reduces eNOS expression; 3) AF causes a proinflammatory activity with
elevation of C-reactive protein and cytokines; and 4) Systemic factors such as the
renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may be prominent in a kind of inflammation
reciprocally "cross-talk" and the RAS inhibition prevents AF<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>THE CONTROVERSY ABOUT LEFT ATRIUM APPENDAGE FUNCTION</title><p>The LAA role as an endocrine organ is greatly underappreciated<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. The LAA contain a variety of
cardiac progenitor cells that is fundamental to many of its underlying functions,
including its vital role in endocrine regulation<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup>. The LAA has critical importance to homeostasis
and cardiovascular physiology, containing almost 30% of the heart atrial natriuretic
factor, which is a potent endocrine modulator including a change in heart rate,
natriuresis, and urination, effects suggestive of the role in modulating body volume
status. Therefore, there was an old controversy about the LAA critical role in a
healthy physiological function that may be eliminated with occlusion procedures, for
example, to keep the critical pressure-induced, stretch receptor endocrine
response<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>. However, the
right atrial appendage can execute similar LAA endocrine effects overcoming this
dilemma. Otherwise, the endocrine regulation should need both LAA structures, and
the LAA exclusion may eventually lead to long-term adverse results, but no studies
to date have shown any adverse effects post-LAA exclusion<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>LEFT ATRIAL APPENDAGE AND STROKE</title><p>The observation that 90% of the thrombi found in nonvalvular AF patients and 57%
found in valvular AF are in the LAA triggered significant interest in the LAA as a
potential therapeutic target. Until recently, the results were inconsistent, and
high rates of incomplete occlusions precluded the medical community from confirming
a definite relationship between LAA and stroke. Anticoagulation is considered the
first-line for stroke risk reduction in AF, and the American College of
Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recommend LAA exclusion only with
surgical ablation of AF or in the context of concomitant mitral valve
surgery<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>. Nowadays,
considering the occlusion devices development Ramlawi et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> recommend LAA exclusion in all AF
patients undergoing cardiac surgery regardless of their suitability for
anticoagulation therapy. For lone AF patients with an embolic risk that necessitates
anticoagulation, it was recommended LAA exclusion in those who have failed or with
relative or absolute contraindications to anticoagulation. Characteristics of the
ideal LAA exclusion include: 1) The procedure is safe and minimally invasive; 2) The
procedure is complete and receives intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram
(TEE) confirmation; 3) The procedure is free of intracardiac foreign bodies; 4) The
procedure is applicable to all LAA morphologies; 5) The procedure allows the
immediate cessation of anticoagulation medications; and 6) The cost is lower
compared to other devices and long-term oral anticoagulation<sup>[<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>ROUTINE SURGICAL EXCLUSION OF THE LEFT APPENDAGE</title><p>Although the LAA occlusion is technically easy, its regular performance is still a
matter of open discussion. A recent study from Mayo Clinic presented in the
Scientific Bulletin of the Brazilian Society of Cardiovascular Surgery (number
01/2017) concluded that there was no need for LAA exclusion and, surprisingly,
associated this surgical maneuver with a higher incidence of postoperative
AF<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>. The study included
9,792 adults who underwent CABG or valve surgery between January 2000 and December
2005, matching a propensity-score analysis. Twenty-eight covariates pretreatment
were performed, 461 matching pairs were derived and analyzed to estimate the
association of LAA closure with early postoperative AF (AF &#x02264; 30 days of
surgery), ischemic stroke and mortality. The authors concluded that after adjustment
for treatment bias, LAA closure during routine cardiac surgery was significantly
associated with early preoperative AF (POAF) increased risk, but without any risk of
stroke or mortality. It remains uncertain whether prophylactic exclusion of LAA is
warranted for stroke prevention during non-AF-related cardiac surgery. Therefore,
the decision of "to close or not to close" the appendage is an open question and
therefore depends on the individual experience of the surgeon<sup>[<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>SURGICAL ASPECTS - "HOW TO CLOSE"</title><p>Some surgeons, including the authors of the present review, routinely close the LAA
in patients having mitral valve surgery, without any adverse results, in accordance
with the literature data. Studies suggest that the LAA has a minimal useful
function, and it is the source of most embolism causing hundreds of thousands of
strokes annually. It is clear that the LAA is the most human lethal appendage.
During cardiac surgery, the LAA removal is safe and has to be considered<sup>[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>. According to the 2017 Society of
Thoracic Surgeons Clinical Practice Guidelines, the surgical ablation for AF can be
carried out without major morbidity or additional risk of operative mortality, and
is recommended at the time of joint mitral operations, at the time of isolated
aortic valve replacement, isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and
concomitant aortic valve replacement plus coronary artery
revascularization<sup>[<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>.
There is an association between LAA decreasing velocity, measured by TEE, and the
development of postoperative AF<sup>[<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>. Also, the LAA reduction flow velocity is a risk factor for
thrombus formation and increases the risk of stroke in patients with AF.
Furthermore, in patients with AF, LAA orifice diameter and LAA volume, but not left
atrial dysfunction, were determinants of stroke and were useful for stratifying
noncardioembolic risk in patients with AF<sup>[<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>. Therefore, these two pieces of evidence (LAA decreasing
flow and volume) reinforce the surgical LAA exclusion.</p></sec><sec><title>TECHNIQUE</title><p>Assuming "to close" LAA to prevent thromboembolism, we will present, as illustration,
a technique based on the discussed basic concepts. The LAA should be damaged
seriously, which explains the historical reluctance to manipulate appendage based on
its fragility and proximity of surrounding structures. Unsuccessful results,
regardless of the technique employed, have been reported. An incomplete LAA
occlusion has been reported in 10% to 73% of patients, depending on simple running
or double suture. Although excision seemed more practical (success rate of 73%), it
was observed a residual stump in 27% of them<sup>[<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>. Our preference,
used since the last 20 years in the association of mitral valve surgery, is quite
similar to the technique described by Hernandez-Estefania et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup>. After entering the left atrium
(LA) by the atrioventricular groove, the LAA is completely invaginated, taking care
in avoiding lesion to the LAA apex. A 4-0 polypropylene purse-string suture is
placed along the base of the appendage including only atrial tissue (remember the
LAA anatomical individuality) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>). The
stitches should be enough for encircling the shape inlet orifice avoiding the LAA
(remember the LAA embryological individuality). To pass across the intimal and
medial tears, avoiding transfixing, is a critical maneuver. While LAA is pulled
outward with forceps, the two ends of the suture are pulled together gently, and the
purse-string suture is tied up. The purse string suture has not to be overtight
because the aim is to delineate the rims, not to obliterate the orifice completely
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>). Finally, a second "out-out"
running suture carried out and then tied up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figures
4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4D</xref>). It is expected that the
right atrial appendage will maintain the pharmacological functions of the excluded
LAA.</p><p>

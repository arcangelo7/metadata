metabolism, resulting from the restriction of blood supply to tissues. Timely blood
flow to ischemic tissue limits ischemia only to reversible cell damage. Blood
re-flow to the ischemic tissue is important for the prevention of irreversible
tissue damage; however, reperfusion may increase tissue damage caused by ischemia.
This is defined as "ischemia-reperfusion injury" and induces a wide pathologic
spectrum from reversible cell damage to multi-organ
dysfunction<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. Several studies are ongoing to halt or slow the
effects of ischemia-reperfusion injury with preconditioning or postconditioning,
while there are also molecular studies to reduce or halt the activity of oxygen
radicals<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup><sup>-</sup><sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. Many previous studies have reported the presence of
reactive oxygen radicals resulting from cross-clamping to abdominal aorta, and
myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury induced by inflammatory response in the
surgical treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm, which is a common disease in
cardiovascular surgery<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup><sup>-</sup><sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>.</p><p>Increase in cardiac morbidity and mortality and, in turn, cardioprotective
approaches, have been subject to many studies to date. Therapeutic studies
particularly aimed at the reduction and prevention of cardiac ischemia-reperfusion
injury still continue to be relevant<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup><sup>-</sup><sup><xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. Acetaminophen or N-acetyl-p-aminophenol (APAP),
which is included in the list of essential medicines for the primary health system,
published by the World Health Organization, is commonly used as an analgesic and
antipyretic<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. APAP has been used in some experimental studies as
a cardioprotective agent during myocardial
ischemia-reperfusion<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup><sup>-</sup><sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. There is no histopathological study in the
literature addressing the cardioprotective role of APAP in cardiac distant organ
ischemia-reperfusion injury induced by lower extremity ischemia. In this light, the
present study was aimed to make histopathological examination of whether
acetaminophen, which has well-defined analgesic and antipyretic effects and which is
currently addressed by laboratory and pre-clinical studies for its cardioprotective
effects, reduced the myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury induced by lower
extremity ischemia induced by cross-clamping to the abdominal aorta.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title></sec><sec><title>Animals and Experimental Groups</title><p>This study was conducted after receiving approval (Protocol No:
T&#x000dc;HDYEK-2011/70 and Decision No: 2011.09.04) of the Trakya University Animal
Experiments Local Ethics Committee. Experimental animals were obtained from the
Experimental Animals Unit of the Faculty of Medicine, Trakya University. Twenty-four
female Sprague-Dawley rats approximately 3-5 months old and weighing 190-250 grams
were randomized in equal numbers (n=8) into the control group, the
ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) group and the ischemia-reperfusion + acetaminophen
(I/R+A) group. Rats were kept in rooms automatically illuminated for 12 hours and
darkened for the subsequent 12 hours, heated at 20-22&#x000ba;C and moisturized by 40-45%
during the whole experiment. During this period, all rats were kept in transparent
cages and fed with standard rat food, and tap water.</p><p>The rats were randomized into three groups (n=8) as (i) control group (only
laparotomy), (ii) aortic ischemia-reperfusion group (60 min of ischemia and 120 min
of reperfusion), and (iii) ischemia-reperfusion + acetaminophen group (15 mg/kg/h
intravenous acetaminophen infusion starting 15 minutes before the end of the
ischemic period and lasting till the end of the reperfusion period). In a study,
Kiris et al.<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup><sup>]</sup> found that cardiac free oxygen radicals production,
lipid peroxidation, and neutrophil activation significantly increased after 30 min
ischemia and 60 min reperfusion in rats undergoing cross-clamping to the abdominal
aorta. Therefore, in our study, we aimed to perform a histopathological examination
after applying myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury through 60 min ischemia and
120 min reperfusion in a rat model.</p></sec><sec><title>Surgical Technique</title><p>All study rats were weighted before the procedures and their weights were recorded.
After eight hours of fasting, ketamine hydrochloride 40 mg/kg (Ketalar&#x000ae; 50
mg/ml flacon, Pfizer) + xylazine hydrochloride 5 mg/kg (Rompun&#x000ae; 23.32 mg/ml,
50 ml flacon, Bayer) were administered intramuscularly under anesthesia.</p><p>An additional dose of ketamine hydrochloride was planned to be administered if
required during the experiment. An additional dose of ketamine hydrochloride was
administered to ensure spontaneous respiration of rats during the whole procedure.
Rats were laid on the table in the supine position under a heating lamp. Samples
were cannulated in the tail vein, using a yellow cannula. After the skin of all rats
be prepared aseptically, laparotomy was performed through the midline just under the
xiphoid process up to 0.5 cm above the pubis. The intestines were shifted to the
right using a wet cloth after the laparotomy. The infrarenal abdominal aorta was
explored via blunt dissection. All rats were administered heparin (100 unit/kg)
(Nevparin&#x000ae; 25000 IU 5 ml flacon, Mustafa Nevzat) as an anticoagulant. 10
ml/kg 0.9% NaCl was administered from the tail vein for fluid resuscitation during
the whole experiment. Infusion was performed using the Braun&#x000ae; Perfusor.</p><sec><title>Ischemia-Reperfusion (I/R) Group</title><p>An atraumatic microvascular clamp (Novaclip&#x000ae; 12 mm Angle) was inserted in
the infrarenal abdominal aorta. After clamping, approximately 5 ml of warm
physiological saline solution was administered to the peritoneal cavity. The
abdomen was closed by three silk sutures to prevent fluid loss. Following 60 min
ischemia, the atraumatic microvascular clamp was removed from the infrarenal
abdominal aorta and a 120 min of reperfusion period was introduced. Aortic
ischemia was followed by pulsation loss after the clamping procedure and
reperfusion by aorta pulsation after clamp removal. After these procedures, the
rats were sacrificed and their hearts removed.</p></sec><sec><title>Ischemia-Reperfusion + Acetaminophen (I/R+A) Group</title><p>In addition to the procedures performed on the rats in the ischemia-reperfusion
group, rats in this group were started on infusion with 15 mg/kg/min
acetaminophen (Perfalgan 1000 mg/100 ml flacon, Bristol-Myers Squibb) 15 minutes
before the aortic clamp was removed, with the infusion lasting till the end of
the reperfusion period. Infusion was performed through the tail vein using
Braun&#x000ae; Perfusor. At the end of the procedures, the rats were sacrificed
and their hearts removed.</p></sec><sec><title>Control Group</title><p>No clamping was performed in the aorta. 5 ml of warm, 0.9% NaCl was injected in
the abdomen which was then closed by three silk sutures to prevent fluid loss.
The rats were kept under this condition for 180 minutes, the time equivalent to
60 min of ischemia plus 120 min of reperfusion performed in the other two
groups. The rats were then sacrificed and their hearts removed.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Histopathological Examination</title><p>Sternotomy was performed in all groups at the end of the reperfusion period, and the
heart was removed for histopathological examination. The tissues were fixed in 10%
neutral-buffered formalin (Carlo Erba Reagents) and embedded in paraffin wax.
Ten-micrometer - thick serial sections were obtained and stained with hematoxylin
and eosin (Sigma Aldrich Co.) for histological evaluation. The specimens of the test
and control groups were examined and photographed in the light microscope.</p><p>There is no standard histopathological scoring system in the literature to assess
distal end-organ injury for I/R related myocardium. Following aortic cross-clamping,
free oxygen radicals in the ischemic lower extremity during reperfusion, complement
activation, and neutrophil chemotaxis are the main components of distal end-organ
ischemia-reperfusion injury<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. The main target of all these components is the
endothelial barrier in the coronary microvascular region. An intraendothelial gap is
created due to endothelial injury and myocardial edema,
eventually<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. With endothelial injury, the chemotaxis of
polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMNL) infiltration occurs<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. In addition,
activation of the complement system enhances tissue edema, directly leading to
cardiomyocyte lysis<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. Complete injury of the endothelium in the coronary
microvascular region results in focal hemorrhages. Thus, the removed hearts were
histopathologically investigated for myocytolysis, polymorphonuclear leukocyte
infiltration, myofibrillar edema and focal hemorrhage.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using the PASW version 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago,
IL, USA) of the Department of Biostatistics, Faculty of Medicine of Trakya
University (License No=10240642). Data were expressed in median (min-max) values or

comparisons. The Bonferroni-corrected Mann-Whitney U test was used to detect groups
which recorded a difference. Statistical significance was set at
<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0167 for the Bonferroni-corrected Mann-Whitney U test. A

injury in rats, induced by the I/R which is caused by abdominal aortic
cross-clamping. Histopathological examinations showed that the acetaminophen
administered group suffered less from focal hemorrhage and myofibrillar edema
induced by I/R injury in rats, which supports the suggestion of this study. No
statistically significant difference was detected between the two groups in terms of
myofibrillar edema; however, myofibrillar edema was observed to be suffered less by
the acetaminophen + I/R group.</p><p>Aortic cross-clamping inserted during abdominal aortic aneurysm operation, induces
ischemia in the lower extremity. Reperfusion of the ischemic leg with oxygenized
blood results in the formation of toxic oxygen metabolites, leukocyte activation,
cytokine release and activation of the complement cascade<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. I/R injury is known
to develop in organs such as the lungs, liver and kidney due to oxidative stress and
inflammatory response caused by high amount of reactive oxygen products produced by
lower extremity reperfusion after the removal of
cross-clamping<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. Hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl and superoxide
radicals, the main reactive oxygen products, are shown to result in peroxidation in
membrane phospholipids of myocardial tissues cells<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. In addition, I/R injury
is suggested to increase by remote organ infiltration of activated neutrophils due
to aortic I/R and the myeloperoxidase enzyme released by them<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. Moreover, released
cytokines, particularly tumor necrosis factor-, induce leukocyte activation and also
damage capillary continuity<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. Formation of membrane attack complex, the
final product of the complement cascade due to activation of the complement cascade,
contributes to damage the integrity of the cell membrane. C3a and C5a, which are
products of this cascade and known as anaphylatoxins, increase leukocyte
chemotaxis<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. As understood, distant organ I/R injury is not a
single reaction, but rather a complex process with intracellular and extracellular
pathophysiologic changes. Histological changes in the heart, resulting from I/R, can
be seen via the light microscope<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. Variables such as myofibrillar edema and focal
hemorrhage detected under the light microscope were recorded in the I/R group, but
not in the control group, which is suggested to be an indicator of distant organ I/R
injury in the heart due to abdominal aorta operation.</p><p>When a radical catcher is used to decrease reperfusion injury, considering the fact
that free radicals rapidly develop within a few minutes after reperfusion, the
catcher should be used just before the ischemic period starts or 15 minutes before
reperfusion since it has no preventive effect if used after
reperfusion<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. As a result, in the scope of the present study,
APAP infusion started 15 minutes before aortic cross-clamping removal.</p><p>There are discussions on the mechanism of action of APAP, one of the most popular and
common drugs used in the treatment of pain and temperature. The drug continues to be
a mystery of pharmacology due to its unknown therapeutic
effects<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. There are experimental studies showing the
possible effects of APAP on reduction of ischemia-reperfusion
injury<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup><sup>-</sup><sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup><sup>-</sup><sup><xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. Different studies offer different mechanisms in
explaining the effect of APAP. An experimental study by Hadzimichalis et
al.<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>
showed that one of the main mechanisms of I/Rinjury is the opening of mitochondrial
permeability transition pore and the increase in mitochondrial cytochrome release,
and that APAP reduces I/R injury and induces myocyte apoptosis by preventing this
opening and increase. In a study by Baliga et al.<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>, acetaminophen was
shown to prevent mitochondrial dysfunction thanks to a similar affect it creates in
I/R in rat brains. In another experimental study, Merrill<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup><sup>]</sup> revealed that APAP,
some phenols of which have antioxidant characteristics, is a phenol compound, and in
turn prevents the release of hydroxyl radicals, which develop in high amounts in the
first minutes of reperfusion, and also reduces peroxide production. In an
experimental study by Rork et al.<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>, APAP was shown to have cardioprotective
effects by reducing I/R injury by preventing destruction of matrix
metalloproteinase-2-induced troponin-I activated by peroxynitrite. Many studies were
conducted according to different systems, showing the antioxidant characteristics of
APAP<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup><sup>-</sup><sup><xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. These studies also showed that APAP reduces
<italic>in-vivo</italic> and <italic>in-vitro</italic> mitochondria-induced
reactive oxygen amount and suggest that APAP does it by acting like
&#x003b1;-tocopherol and like a direct phenolic radical scavenger. In addition, Nam
et al.<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>
showed in their study that acetaminophen reacts with peroxyl radicals more than with
other phenol compounds used as antioxidant. In their study, Jaques-Robinson et
al.<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>
showed that APAP is a cardioprotective and antiarrhythmic agent against the
oxidative damage induced by hydrogen peroxide in canine heart.</p><p>Different studies offer different durations for I/R in the development of myocardial
damage after lower extremity I/R. In a study by Kiris et al.<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup><sup>]</sup> in which the rats were
induced with 30 min ischemia followed by 60 min reperfusion, malonyldialdehyde,
catalase, superoxide dismutase levels, and myeloperoxidase activity were found to be
statistically, significantly higher in the aortic I/R group compared to the control
group. In the aforementioned study, the authors found that the heart was
biochemically affected by elevated oxidative stress metabolism biomarkers with 30
min ischemia and 60 min reperfusion<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. In their study where 120 minutes of ischemia
were followed by 120 minutes of reperfusion, Narin et al.<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup><sup>]</sup> found statistically
significant higher malonyldialdehyde, catalase, and superoxide dismutase levels in
the aortic I/R group compared to the control group. In the histopathological
examination, myocardial disorganization, myocardial swelling, and myofiber
eosinophilia were examined and all these variables were found to be statistically,
significantly higher in the ischemia-reperfusion group. However, Ko&#x000e7;arslan et
al.<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>
performed 45 min ischemia and 60 min reperfusion and found no significant difference
in the I/R injury using cardiac biochemical or histopathological parameters. In an
experimental study, Aydin et al.<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup><sup>]</sup> performed 60 min ischemia and 120 min
reperfusion, as in our study. Similar to Ko&#x000e7;arslan et
al.<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>'s study, the authors examined interstitial edema,
inflammatory cellular infiltration, and coagulation necrosis, and they were able to
find a significant difference only in the myofibrillar swelling in the I/R group.
Ko&#x000e7;arslan et al.<sup>[</sup><sup><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup><sup>]</sup> showed that, although the biomarkers of the
oxidative stress metabolism increased during I/R, there was no histopathological
sign indicating that 45 min ischemia does not lead to cardiac injury as assessed by
light microscopy. These findings suggest that 60 min ischemia at least should be
applied for distal end-organ injury in the lower extremity I/R model in rats, as in
our study. Although PMNL is a component for I/R injury, it did not lead to a
statistically significant difference in cardiac infiltration in our study and
previous studies. Although we found a significant difference in myofibrillar
swelling and focal hemorrhage between the control and ischemia-reperfusion groups,
we observed no myocytolysis and PMNL infiltration, indicating no severe reaction to
achieve enhanced complement system activation and significant PMNL infiltration in
the I/R model (<xref rid="t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Therefore, we
suggest longer I/R duration to histopathologically examine these four parameters
under light microscopy.</p><p>The present study suggests that APAP reduced focal hemorrhage in the I/R group at a
statistically significant level but had no such effect on myofibrillar edema. The
statistical significance of our study was increased by lowering the statistical
significance down to <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0167. As a result of the Bonferroni
correction, the examination of median values shows that myofibrillar edema was
histopathologically higher in the I/R group, although acetaminophen was observed not
to reduce myofibrillar edema at a statistically significant level (<xref rid="t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Authors of the present study suggest
that despite having no statistically significant preventive effect on myofibrillar
edema, acetaminophen has a clinically protective effect.</p><p>There are two limitations of the present study. The first limitation is the small
sample size, while the second limitation is that cardiac injury resulting from
ischemia-reperfusion injury and reactive oxygen metabolite activity induced by I/R
were not analyzed using biochemical indicators.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, acetaminophen is considered to have cardioprotective effects by
reducing myocardial injury induced by abdominal aortic ischemia-reperfusion. Studies
continue to be made to reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury in times when cardiac
morbidity and mortality is on the increase. Future clinical studies should be made
concerning the effect of acetaminophen.</p><table-wrap id="t4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="5%" span="1"/><col width="95%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">OG</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Substantial contributions to the

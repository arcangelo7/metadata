The World Health Organization (WHO) affirms that injuries related to burns are a global public health problem mainly in low- and middle-income countries. The first step towards reducing any preventable injury is based on accurate information. In Colombia, the basic epidemiological characteristics of burn injuries are unknown. The objectives were establishing the causes, high-risk populations, mortality rate, and tendencies of burn deaths.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Observational, analytical, population-based study based on official death certificate occurred between 2000 and 2009. All codes of the International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision (ICD-10) related to burns were included. The mortality rates were standardized using the WHO world average age weights 2000&#x02013;2025. To determine the tendency, an average annual percent change (AACP) was calculated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 5448 deaths due to burns were identified; 78.4&#x000a0;% were men. The crude and adjusted burn mortality rate was 1.270 and 1.302 per 100,000, respectively. The AACP was &#x02212;5.25&#x000a0;%. Electrical injury caused the greatest number of deaths (49.5&#x000a0;%), followed by fire and lightning injuries. A total of 1197 (22.1&#x000a0;%) children were under 15&#x000a0;years old. The causes of deaths were different among age groups. 59.4 % deaths occurred outside health institutions. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study is a first step in identifying the main causes of death and groups with higher mortality rates. Electricity is the main cause of deaths due to burn injury. Further research is required in order to generate awareness among government and community for reducing the number of injuries and burn deaths in our country.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Traumatic injuries represent one of the most important public health problems that both developing and industrialized countries face.

Mortality rates are expressed as deaths per 100,000 people using official estimated population by DANE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The rates were age-standardized using the direct method with 5-year age categories and were calculated using the WHO world average age weights 2000&#x02013;2025.

The mortality rate in Colombia (1.28 per 100,000) is low compared to the global mortality rate and it is very similar to that of other countries such as Korea (1.3 per 100.000 in 2001) and the USA (1.09 per 100,000 in 2007) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] but far higher than that of Mexico (0.72 per 100,000 in 2007) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]; though, our mortality rate has also been declining from 1.400 to 0.978 (year 2000 to 2009, respectively) as in other countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>However, there is a difference with the data from international organizations. According to the WHO, Colombia has a burn mortality rate of 0.44 per 100,000 for 2008 similar to that of countries like Venezuela (0.43 per 100,000), Panama (0.29 per 100,000), Mexico (0.63 per 100,000), and Bolivia (0.38 per 100,000). According to this WHO data, 7752 deaths occurred in the Americas with a mortality rate of 0.85 deaths per 100,000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], which was well below that of Europe (2.3 per 100,000), Africa (4.9 per 100,000), and East and South Asia (4.8 per 100,000). Is our country and our region doing that well? This difference may have an explanation. Code U153 (GBD code) titled Unintentional injuries: Fires, used for the WHO reports, only includes the ICD-10 codes (X00&#x02013;X09). It does not include codes for hot liquids (X10&#x02013;X12), hot gases (X13, X14), hot solid (X15&#x02013;X19), or electrical injuries (W85&#x02013;W87) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. With electrical burns as our leading cause of death, the mortality rate in our study is 2.5-folds higher than that reported by the WHO. With the inclusion of other causes of burns, official mortality rates can be raised not only in our country but in countries with similar characteristics of development, showing that the problem is underestimated.</p><p>The results of this epidemiological study show male predominance of burns and compromise most productive ages. These results are consistent with several reports from other populations. It was observed that scalds are significantly more frequent in less than 5-year-old age group when compared with other causes of burns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Fire is a common cause of burns in children under 5&#x000a0;years old and men over 65&#x000a0;years old. Electricity affects mainly young workers so it is not surprising that there are populations with higher mortality rate than those under 5&#x000a0;years and over 65&#x000a0;years since the fatality rate in these populations is much higher.</p><p>In Colombia, in our experience, the higher frequency of electrical accidents is by accidental contact with power lines that pass very close to the houses, and they occurred usually, during local housing arrangement; in a few other cases, it is due to the illegal manipulation of electrical lines to obtain the wires and then sell the copper. Electricity can cause instant death even if the accident occurs at home with low voltage. Electricity generates cardiac arrhythmias, asystole, or prolonged respiratory arrest, which are fatal if resuscitation is not performed immediately. The vast majority die before being admitted to a medical institution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>It is interesting and surprising that lightning injuries are the third leading cause of death from burns. However, Colombia is reported as one of the countries with higher density of lightning in the world, probably because of its location relative to the equator in the inter-tropical confluence zone, the topographic variation, and its mountain ranges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This can be explained by the high agricultural activity our country has; a quarter of our population live in remote rural areas, and there is lack of information on risk assessment and prevention.</p><p>There are other distinctive features of our burn mortality such as death at the scene without medical attention. Nearly half of those, who died from burns, died without getting pre-hospital medical care by trained personnel, relatives, or the community. This can be explained by two findings from our own study. First, almost all the people who suffer accidents in townships, villages, and dispersed rural areas die without medical care. Colombia is a country in northern South America; it has been estimated that by 2013, about a quarter of the population will be living outside urban areas. Colombia has a vast territory of 1,141,748&#x000a0;km<sup>2</sup> which correspond to the mainland. It presents great topographic difficulty since there are three ridges which are the northern termination of the Andes. Secondly, of the accidents that occur in urban areas, a one third (32.0&#x000a0;%) is produced by electricity.</p><p>A limitation in our study is the difference between variables and categories during the years of the study, mainly after the implementation of electronic death certificates in 2008. At that time, new important information was added. It was impossible to determine variables, such as social security, education or marital status, or to identify whether the burn accident was related to the job. Only in the last 2&#x000a0;years of the study with the electronic format, the recording of deaths related to work, was included. Out of the 812 patients with the possibility of working, including children population, 144 had injuries related to the job (17.7&#x000a0;%). There is no such data for almost half of the cases (45.1&#x000a0;%). Another limitation is that there is very little availability of population-based studies to compare our findings with. Institution-based studies typically relate to the local population, the percentage of referrals from remote areas, the availability of hospital beds, the time from the accident to hospitalization, and pre-hospital fatality.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Recommendations</title><p>Thus, the recommendations based on our results are&#x000a0;as follow:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>To identify stakeholders and broader collaborative groups to work on prevention of burns;</p></list-item><list-item><p>To create a national burn repository for epidemiologic and clinical data;</p></list-item><list-item><p>To obtain data regarding the incidence of thermal injuries, the risk factors associated with burns in our community, and lethality;</p></list-item><list-item><p>To generate prevention policies mainly in populations and areas of greatest risk (children, elderly, electrical safety);</p></list-item><list-item><p>To implement multidisciplinary interventions for risk mitigation by community staff, primarily on the basic knowledge regarding first aid and resuscitation.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Burn trauma is preventable in many cases. The first step towards the development of interventions for injury prevention is surveillance and identification of the risk factors. This is the first population-based burn death study in Colombia. But deaths are only the tip of the iceberg and the number of non-fatal injuries per year, morbidity, and lethality in our country is unknown.</p><p>Our study identifies risk at all ages for different reasons. Population groups with higher risk are those under 5&#x000a0;years and over 65&#x000a0;years old. The mortality rate tended to decrease during the length of the study and was higher in rural area than the urban areas. Electricity is the principal cause of burn deaths in Colombia, followed by fire and lightning and the deaths occurred mainly outside health institutions. Children under 5&#x000a0;years are affected principally due to fire and scalds.</p><p>A few specific recommendations can be given based on these epidemiologic features that will allow for the design of prevention strategies for this type of injury, focused mainly on electrical injuries in young people, fire burn injuries in children, and also first aid measures mainly regarding cardiopulmonary resuscitation.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>NN participated in the design of the study and data collection.

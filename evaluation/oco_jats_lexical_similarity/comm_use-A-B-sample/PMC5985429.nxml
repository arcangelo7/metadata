This month WHO launched a new clinical handbook to help health-care workers provide such care.</p><p>The handbook, entitled <italic>Care of girls and women living with female genital mutilation</italic>, provides advice on how to care for and communicate with girls and women who have developed health complications due to FGM, as well as with their husbands, partners and relatives. </p><p>The handbook is designed to support a wide range of health-care providers, including obstetricians, gynaecologists, surgeons, general practitioners, midwives, nurses and mental health professionals. </p><p>It provides guidance on how health-care workers can provide quality health care to girls and women who have health problems due to FGM, including immediate and short-term urogynaecological and obstetric complications. </p><p>Advice and clinical information for health workers is included, so that they can help affected girls and women make informed decisions about whether to undergo deinfibulation, a surgical procedure that can reverse a form of FGM known as infibulation.</p><p>One section of the handbook provides advice on how to support women who have mental health and sexual health complications caused by FGM. </p><p>More than 200 million girls and women have undergone FGM in 30 countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, and the practice occurs in other countries as well.</p><p>bit.ly/2EAD7eU </p></sec><sec><title>Latent tuberculosis: guidelines </title><p>WHO released consolidated guidelines on testing and treatment for tuberculosis infection, especially among groups who are particularly at risk, such as children and people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). </p><p>In<italic> Latent tuberculosis infection: updated and consolidated guidelines for programmatic management,</italic> WHO recommends action in three areas: identifying population groups that are at risk for latent tuberculosis infection, as well as, expanding testing and treatment options for these latent infections. </p><p>WHO has also developed a mobile application to support programmatic management of latent tuberculosis infection. </p><p>You can access the mobile application here: bit.ly/2ICjy8k.</p></sec><sec><title>Fewer tuberculosis patients </title><p>The number of new tuberculosis patients decreased at an average rate of 4.3% every year between 2007 and 2016 in the 53-country WHO European Region, according to a report by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe.</p><p>Despite this rapid decline, countries in the WHO Region are not on track to achieve the targets to end the tuberculosis epidemic. </p><p>The Stop TB strategy sets the target of a 90% reduction in new cases by 2035. The target of sustainable development goal 3 is a reduction of 80% of cases by 2030, as compared with the baseline year of 2015. </p><p>Low detection rates and inadequate treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR&#x02013;TB) are the main drivers of the tuberculosis epidemic in Europe, the report said. </p><p>Data from the 2016 tuberculosis surveillance and monitoring report indicate that one in four people with MDR&#x02013;TB in the WHO European Region does not receive a diagnosis. </p><p>Diagnosis of MDR&#x02013;TB patients increased from 33% in 2011 to 73% in 2016, but it remains to be seen whether the regional target of 85% will be achieved, as defined in the <italic>Tuberculosis action plan for the WHO European Region 2016&#x02013;2020</italic>.</p><p>Treating patients with drug resistant forms of tuberculosis is another challenge: the observed increase in treatment success from 46% in 2013 to 55% in 2016 is still insufficient for countries in the European Region to reach the 75% target for 2020 they committed to in the action plan.</p><p>The spread of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) is an additional threat to ending tuberculosis in the WHO European Region. With the rapid rollout of drug-susceptibility testing and improved surveillance, countries in the WHO European Region detected 5000 XDR&#x02013;TB cases in 2016. On average only one in three patients with XDR&#x02013;TB is cured. </p><p>bit.ly/2EtZzGl</p><boxed-text id="Bb" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Cover photo</title></caption><p>A man with his baby daughter in Ain Issa Camp in Raqqa governorate in the Syrian Arab Republic, where WHO is providing health services for camp residents through a health centre and a mobile health team.</p><fig id="Fb" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><graphic xlink:href="BLT.18.010518-Fb"/><attrib>WHO/L.

cardiovascular surgery<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>. The
overall incidence of deep sternal wound infections (DSWI) ranges from 0.4% to 5%.
Despite the low incidence, damage to patients and hospital costs are
substantial<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Antibiotic prophylaxis is one of the main preventive measures. The importance of
prophylactic antibiotics for cardiac surgery has been widely studied in Brazil by
S&#x000e1; et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>, who evaluated
several studies carried out over the last 30 years. The use of different antibiotics
to the same end clearly indicates that there is no consensus on the efficacy and
safety of each one<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>. Therefore,
there is still no absolute certainty that the main antibiotics used effectively
reach the tissues where infection occurs.</p><p>The objective of this study is to measure the concentration of cefazolin in the
adipose tissue of the mediastinum in patients undergoing cardiac surgery in order to
determine variation in cefazolin concentrations at the beginning and at the end of
surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Location and Period of the Study</title><p>This study was conducted with 19 patients undergoing cardiac surgery at Dom

Sciences Center of Federal University of Pernambuco. This research follows the
principles of the Helsinki Declaration for research on humans.</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion Criteria</title><p>Patients over 18 years old who underwent cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary
bypass (CPB) [coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery, valve replacement,
aortic aneurysm or multiple cardiac surgery] in which the access to the heart
was through the sternum (sternotomy).</p></sec><sec><title>Exclusion Criteria</title><p>Patients requiring antibiotic prophylaxis other than cefazolin; patients with
impaired renal function (creatinine &#x0003e; 1.5 mg/dl); patients who had low
preoperative cardiac output with the use of vasoactive drugs.</p></sec><sec><title>Technical Procedures</title><p>All patients received an antibiotic regimen with cefazolin administered as
follows: a first dose of 2g diluted in 100 ml saline at anesthesia induction,
followed by a dose of 1g diluted in 100 mL saline, every four hours during
surgery. The cefazolin used in all surgical procedures had the same trademark.
The company which produces the antibiotic played no part in this study, so that
there was no conflict of interest.</p><p>Regarding the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), the following
recommendations were considered: for <italic>Staphylococcus aureus,</italic> 1
&#x000b5;g/mL, and for <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic>, 4
&#x000b5;g/mL<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample Preparation</title><p>Two samples of approximately 1 g of subcutaneous tissue were collected for
analysis: the first sample was collected right after sternotomy (time 1) and the
second, before sternal synthesis with steel wires, near the end of surgery (time
2). The tissue was collected from the anterior mediastinum. The samples were
shipped in a styrofoam box with ice, at a temperature of -80&#x000ba;C to
Laborat&#x000f3;rio de Imunopatologia Keizo Asami (LIKA) and were thawed only at
the time of analysis.</p><p>Samples were prepared according to the protocol described by Sings et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>, in 1984, and
more recently reproduced by Waltrip et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>.

&#x000b5;m filter.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>Sample Analysis</title><p>The measuring of the antibiotic dose in the samples was performed by HPLC reverse
phase with the &#x000c4;KTA Purifier 10 GE<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> system. The column
used was C18-300, 250 x 4.6 mm ID. A specialized biochemist carried out this
analysis.</p><p>The mobile phase consisted of 85% 0.01M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 15% of a
solution comprised of 96% acetonitrile and 4% methanol. A volume of 100
&#x000b5;l of the solution was injected through a C18-300, 250 x 4.6 mm, column
with a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min through an isocratic method.</p><p>Cefazolin absorbency was measured at a 254 nm wavelength using an ultraviolet
detector device. Chromatography was performed at room temperature. For each
sample, three analyses were performed separately. A standard curve for cefazolin
was established through the adipose tissue samples, which were initially free of
cefazolin and then received the antibiotic in increasing concentrations of 10,
20, 30, 40 and 50 &#x000b5;g/ml. The chromatograms of the samples and the areas
corresponding to the cefazolin curve were drawn by Unicorn
4.11<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> software, which received the data directly from the
&#x000c4;KTA purifier machine 10.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>To analyze the data, first a database with patient information was built using a
simple table in Microsoft Office Excel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. The data was then
exported to Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 18, whereby
the statistical analysis was performed. The qualitative variables were:
hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking, CABG surgery, valve surgery, or
correction of aortic aneurysm. They were described in absolute and relative
frequency (percentage). Quantitative variables, such as body mass index (BMI),
time of first and second collections, and first and second level of cefazolin,
were expressed as minimum, maximum, mean, median, and standard deviation. In
addition, the confidence interval for each variable was calculated.</p><p>Normal distribution was assessed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. To assess the
correlations "time 1 x cefazolin level 1", "time 2 x cefazolin level 2", and
"BMI x cefazolin level 2", the Pearson's correlation coefficient was used, where
a normal behavior for the distribution of variables was observed. Additionally,
a linear regression model adjustment (Spearman's test) was applied in order to
determine the degree of increase or decrease in cefazolin levels from the
variation in the time of data collection and the patient's BMI. All statistical
conclusions were drawn considering a significance level of 5%.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In total, 19 patients were analyzed. Average age of patients was 60.3 years and most
individuals were female (63.2%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).
The BMI analysis found 15 (79.8%) patients with BMI &#x0003c;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 3
(15.8%) patients had a BMI between 30-40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and only 1 (5.26%) was

</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>To validate the HPCL method in the analysis of cephalosporins, Sings et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> described the liquid
chromatography analysis of 10 different cephalosporins using an extraction procedure
with easily adjustable reagents for each cefazolin, in any of its three mobile
phases. All experiments were performed with human plasma collected from the Akron
City Hospital blood bank, which had antibiotics added to it. The chromatography was
performed at room temperature using ultraviolet detection at 254 nm and a C-18
column (300 x 4 mm). Antibiotics were quantified by measuring the peak heights of
each cephalosporin, which were determined by the characteristics of each
substance<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The statistical analysis of the chromatographic data for each plasma sample
supplemented with antibiotic was conducted in all therapeutic ranges of each
cephalosporin. These various therapeutic ranges were determined from clinical data
collected in previous studies, using the microbiological assay agar diffusion.
Following the aforementioned analysis, the study stated that the HPLC method was in
accordance with the clinical acceptability criteria, with excellent precision,
specificity, and sensitivity. In this sense, data from the study indicate that HPLC
is easily adaptable to the dosage of cephalosporins levels.</p><p>Thus, this study corroborates what is now recommended in the Brazilian and American
Pharmacopoeias regarding the quantification of cefazolin, which confirms the
reliability of the results found here, for very similar methods of diluents were
used and, with respect to the column (C-18300, 250 x 4.6 mm), we applied a more
advanced technique which provides more accurate results<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Toothaker et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> published a
review article on analytical methods for cephalosporins in biological fluids and
showed that, since 1980, chromatography has been the primary technique used for the
analysis of cephalosporins measurements. This technology provides selectivity,
accuracy, as well as ease of use. In the studied articles, it was also noted that
the proper selection of the method depends on the constraints imposed by the
objective of the study. The studies evaluated cephalosporins measured in the muscle
tissue, bone, and urine, and, in most of them, HPLC was the preferred technique
since it has the ability to distinguish between the drug and other
metabolites<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Pevzner et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> assayed cefazolin
in adipose tissue of 29 patients by agar diffusion in an attempt to assess its
distribution according to BMI. Two grams of this antibiotic were injected 30-60
minutes before incision. Their results showed that cefazolin concentrations were
inversely related to BMI and a considerable number of patients with a BMI above 40
did not reach minimum inhibitory concentrations for Gram negative cocci, suggesting
that the currently recommended dose may result in failure in obese patients. This
study indicates that, in patients with BMI below 40, a 2g dose of cefazolin is
sufficient to reach the minimum inhibitory concentration, which is consistent with
the results found in the sample of our study, even though we used a different
technique from that recommended by the Brazilian and American pharmacopoeias.</p><p>Waltrip et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> carried out a
study aiming to assess the safety of the prophylaxis with cefazolin schemes in
cardiac surgery. Adipose tissue samples of the subcutaneous tissue of 34 patients
were collected near the sternal wound, and then taken to the laboratory to establish
the cefazolin concentrations, which were determined by the HPLC method. The results
showed that, in group 1 (receiving 1 g of cefazolin preoperatively and 1 g at the
end of the procedure), the concentration of cefazolin ranged from 3 to 6
&#x000b5;g/mL and, in group 2 (given 2 g of cefazolin preoperatively and continuous
infusion of 20 mg/min throughout the surgery), it ranged from 5 to 16 &#x000b5;g/mL.
It was noted then that, in group 1, the safe concentration was not maintained
throughout the surgery whereas, in group 2 (which received a further similar scheme
to that used in the work herein), the minimum inhibitory concentration was achieved
throughout the whole surgical procedure.</p><p>Fellinger et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> analyzed the
serum concentration of cefazolin in patients who underwent cardiac surgery with CPB.
A group of 10 patients received 1 gram of cefazolin during anesthetic induction and
1 gram right before CPB. The cefazolin was extracted from blood samples and measured
by HPLC 5 times. Cefazolin levels remained consistently above MIC<sub>90</sub> for
<italic>S. aureus</italic> as well as for <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>
throughout the time of surgery. The highest seric levels of cefazolin, with an
average of 35.56 &#x000b5;g/mL, occurred after the second dose of cefazolin during
CPB. The lowest seric levels of cefazolin, averaging 6.34 &#x000b5;g/mL, were found
right after the start of CPB and before administration of the second dose of
cefazolin. It is noticeable that a satisfactory dose of cefazolin serum may be
correlated with effective doses in the adipose tissue of the mediastinum.</p><p>Caffarelli et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> sought to
assess the effects of CPB and profound hypothermic circulatory arrest on plasma
cefazolin levels administered for antimicrobial prophylaxis in cardiovascular
surgery. Four groups (10 patients per group) were prospectively studied: vascular
surgery without CPB (group A), cardiac surgery with a CPB time of less than 120
minutes (group B), cardiac surgery with a CPB time of greater than 120 minutes
(group C), and cardiac surgery with CPB and profound hypothermic circulatory arrest
(group D). Subjects received cefazolin at induction and before wound closure.
Arterial blood samples were obtained preceding cefazolin administration, at skin
incision, hourly during the operation, and before redosing. Cefazolin plasma
concentrations were determined by radial diffusion assay, with
<italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> as the indicator microorganism. Cefazolin
plasma concentrations were considered noninhibitory at 8 &#x000b5;g/mL or less,
intermediate at 16 &#x000b5;g/mL, and inhibitory at 32 &#x000b5;g/mL or greater. In
group A, cefazolin plasma concentrations remained greater than 16 &#x000b5;g/mL
during the complete surgical procedure. In group B, cefazolin plasma concentrations
diminished to 16 &#x000b5;g/mL or less in 30% of the patients, but remained above 8
&#x000b5;g/mL. In group C, cefazolin plasma concentrations decreased to less than 16
&#x000b5;g/mL in 60% of patients and were less than 8 &#x000b5;g/mL in 50% of
patients. In group D, cefazolin plasma concentrations reached 16 &#x000b5;g/mL in 66%
of the patients and decreased to 8 &#x000b5;g/mL in only 1 patient. The authors
concluded that for patients undergoing cardiac surgery with a CPB time of greater
than 120 minutes, a single dose of cefazolin before skin incision with redosing at
wound closure does not provide targeted antimicrobial cefazolin plasma levels during
the entire surgical procedure.</p><p>Considering that routine use of the internal mammary artery (IMA) as a bypass graft
increases the risk of DSWI, possibly by a surgically induced perfusion
deficit<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>, Andreas et
al.<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> hypothesized that
IMA preparation impairs antibiotic penetration into presternal tissue during CABG.
The authors carried out a study with eight patients undergoing skeletonized left IMA
harvesting for CABG. Standard antibiotic prophylaxis was administered: 4g of
cefazolin before skin incision and an additional 2g during skin closure.
Concentrations of cefazolin were measured in subcutaneous tissue on the presternal
right and left sides (surgically affected) after sternotomy and, additionally, in
subcutaneous tissue on the thigh (surgically unaffected) by microdialysis over a
10-hour period. In the results, mean peak tissue concentration and the area under
the curve (AUC) on the left sternal side were significantly reduced compared with
the right side and the thigh (mean peak concentration, 13.1&#x000b1;5.8
<italic>versus</italic> 24.1&#x000b1;4.7 and 27.8&#x000b1;9.7 &#x000b5;g/mL;
<italic>P</italic>=0.005 and <italic>P</italic>=0.013; AUC 74.2&#x000b1;31.0
<italic>versus</italic> 110.4&#x000b1;25.0 and 140.3&#x000b1;46.3 &#x000b5;g x
hours per milliliter; <italic>P</italic>=0.004 and <italic>P</italic>=0.002). Mean
subcutaneous concentrations of cefazolin on the left sternal side exceeded the
minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC<sub>90</sub>) of <italic>Staphylococcus
epidermidis</italic> of 4 g/mL in only 37.5% of the patients after 5 hours. The
authors concluded that IMA harvesting significantly impairs local antibiotic
penetration during CABG and common antibiotic dosing schemas should be reevaluated
in this cardiac surgical setting. Even with the protection failing in 3 patients,
the overall average of the antibiotic concentration was maintained throughout the
surgery at high levels (17.5 &#x000b5;g/ ml), well above those found in the study
carried out here. It must be considered that the prophylactic dose used (4g at the
start of surgery and 2g at the end) was twice that used in the sample presented
here. Moreover, even though Andreas et al.<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> collected the cefazolin through microdialysis, the
measurement was performed through the HPLC method.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>An appropriate concentration of cefazolin was found in the adipose tissue of the
mediastinum of the studied population, both at the beginning of the surgery and at

showed a negative and significant correlation between cefazolin level and the second

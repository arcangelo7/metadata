patients at high risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD)<sup>[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>.
Advancements in programming this device have been significantly decreased the
necessity for shocks and their quantity, otherwise, acute and chronic complications
related to the implantation of a transvenous ICD (TV-ICD) result in a significant
increase in peri-operative morbidity<sup>[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Currently, the insertion of leads into the central venous system and within cardiac
chambers is considered the most fragile portion of this pacing system since it could
cause vascular obstruction, thrombosis, cardiac perforation and cardiac tamponade;
leads are also associated with infectious complications, such as endocarditis, and
mechanical complications, such as pneumothorax<sup>[<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. Silicone breakage,
micro-fracture or even the fracture of the lead, which is estimated in 0.58% per
year and more than 20% in 10 years<sup>[<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> could lead to
inappropriate shocks or non-delivery of appropriate shocks.</p><p>The subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator (S-ICD) was developed to
mitigate the complications inherent to lead placement into cardiovascular system
aiming primarily patients with congenital heart disease, immunosuppressed patients,
patients with permanent intravascular access for hemodialysis, or those with severe
cardiovascular system problems in which lead passage would be almost impossible. The
result was the development of a device whose lead preserves the cardiovascular
system. The S-ICD was authorized in Europe in 2009, in the United States in 2012 and
recently this new technology has been authorized in Brazil as well.</p><p>The purpose of this study is to report the initial experience of 18 consecutive cases
of S-ICD implantation showing the indications and peri-operative complications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>Between September 2016 and March 2017, 18 patients with indication for primary and
secondary prevention of SCD, with no concomitant indication for artificial cardiac
pacing for the treatment of symptomatic bradycardia, cardiac resynchronization
therapy and/or antitachycardia therapy, were included. After S-ICD potential
benefits had been presented to the patients and accepted by them, the patients were
submitted to the screening phase by validating the QRS complexes through a specific
ruler designed for this purpose. The procedure was performed in the operating room
under general anesthesia. After antisepsis and surgical fields positioning, three
incisions were made in the first 15 patients and just two incisions in the last
three patients. The first one to create the pocket in which the pulse generator will
be placed was made with approximately 6 cm between the fifth and sixth intercostal
spaces, nearby the nipple, beginning next to the anterior axillary line towards the
middle axillary line; the second one with 3 cm in parasternal position nearby the
xiphoid process and the third one with 2 cm at the third intercostal space region
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2</xref>). The lead was tunneled through the first incision, made to
create the pocket, to the incision next to the xiphoid process and then to the third
incision, approximately 14 cm in straight line to sternal, at the third space
region. All these tunnelizations were performed between the muscle plan and the
subcutaneous tissue. Afterwards, the lead was connected to the pulse generator,
which was positioned in the pocket made between the fascia of the transverse muscle
and the great dorsal muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). The
last three patients had the lead tunneled from the second incision toward to the
Louis angle with a 11 French introducer avoiding the third incision. Then, the
defibrillation test (DFT) was performed in order to assess the system
efficiency.</p><p>

female and 15 male, with mean age 52&#x000b1;12 years, and mean EF 48&#x000b1;11.8%
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4</xref>). Four patients had indication for secondary prevention and 14
for primary prevention. Five out of 18 patients had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,
five with ischemic cardiomyopathy, four with Chagas disease cardiomyopathy, one with
non-compacted myocardium, one with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy,
one with primary ventricular fibrillation (VF) and one with congenital long QT
syndrome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>

</p><p>It was difficult to place the subcutaneous lead at the parasternal line in two
patients, one due to grade II obesity with body mass index (BMI) of 32 and the other
one due to <italic>pectus excavatum</italic> thoracic deformity. In all cases the
cut off heart rate was set up to 170 beats per minute. In 16 cases, VF was induced
and reverted to sinusal rhythm with a 65 Joules shock. In one case, even after the
repositioning of the electrode, a successfully defibrillation only occurred after
the second shock with 80 Joules and, in another patient, even with an appropriate
positioning, the sinus rhythm was only restored with the third shock, both patients
were considered to a late retest for at least 30 days after the procedure. The mean
time between sensing and shock was 18&#x000b1;3 seconds.</p><p>One patient returned a week after the procedure complaining about an increase in pain
intensity at pulse generator pocket site, which was associated with edema,
temperature rising and hyperemia. This clinical condition was solved providing
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and therapy with antibiotics over 7 days and
two patients demanded antialgic medication for five days after the procedure. A
reintervention was necessary in one patient to replace the lead in order to correct
inappropriate shocks caused by myopotential oversensing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The greatest advantage of the S-ICD is avoiding the implantation of leads within
cardiovascular system, thus preserving central venous circulation, with no risks of
mechanical traumas, such as vascular damages or pneumothorax, and with a very low
risk of systemic infection<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. An
important disadvantage is the impossibility of the system to provide heart pacing.
For this reason, it is contraindicated for patients with indication for bradycardia
pacing, cardiac resynchronization therapy or antitachycardia pacing (ATP) since
S-ICD cannot provide cardiac pacing other than for a short period post-shock, when
necessary<sup>[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>. Based on the
benefits and after pre-selecting the patients, this new technology was chosen to be
used.</p><p>After selecting the patients, they were submitted to the screening phase using a
customized plastic ruler supplied by the manufacturer with the purpose of evaluating
if the generated electric signal would be able to provide an appropriate functioning
of the S-ICD. Although it is estimated that 7% of the patients do not show
appropriate electric signals<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>,
all of our patients were approved to be implanted.</p><p>All the implants were successfully accomplished. We did not depend on cardiac anatomy
and venous system, but instead we depended on thorax morphology, size and structure.
We faced some difficulties to position the lead when tunneling it at the sternal
region between proximal and distal incisions; one case due to a great quantity of
subcutaneous tissue, patient with a high BMI, and unfortunately this is a condition
that has been increasing in our country and currently almost half of Brazilian
population are overweight<sup>[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>. The
other one due to a thoracic deformity. In this last one, even after repositioning
the lead, the highest defibrillation threshold was achieved. As well as described in
the literature<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>, our success
rate to convert the induced tachyarrhythmia during the implant defibrillator test
was quite satisfactory bearing in mind that two out of 18 presented a higher
defibrillation threshold than expected, less than 80 Joules. We sought the Technical
Consultant Boston Scientific Therapy Systems Support for some help. They informed us
that there are a few known causes of high DFTs for SICD devices. The first one would
be amiodarone, the second one would be a long time of anesthesia and the third one
would be a suboptimal system positioning, and thus if the shock impedance is in the
normal range, it is a medical decision whether to wait and try DFT on a different
day with medication changes or less anesthesia. As these two patients had been
taking amiodarone for a long time, the medicine was withdrawn and the threshold test
was redone after 30 days at least. But both patients didn&#x000b4;t return yet to do the new
threshold assessment.</p><p>Similar to the 3-year follow-up data of EFFORTLESS Registry<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>, which is the first great
international non-randomized, multicenter registry designed to follow-up and assess
the long term clinical and device outcomes from S-ICD, our data show 77.8% of the
patients submitted to the intervention for primary prevention (14 patients) and
22.2% for secondary prevention (4 patients). On the other hand, only 22.2% of our
patients (4 patients) treated for primary prevention showed EF less than 35%
compared with 30.6% of the EFFORTLESS Registry<sup>[<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. In comparison, our numbers for the disease etiology were
also different. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was responsible for 27.7% (5 patients)
of the indications and ischemic cardiomyopathy for 27.7% (5 patients) compared with
11.7% and 31.1%, respectively, of EFFORTLESS. These differences can be explained,
firstly, by the reduced number of our sample and, secondly, although the increasing
evidences of indications for primary prevention in ischemic patients with reduced EF
and also because this is an initial experience, the trend was choosing indications
in younger patients and without the necessity of using a great quantity of negative
chronotropic drugs. It is important to notice that four patients had Chagas disease
and it is also well known that approximately 60% of these cases, the sinus node is
injured, developing a more or less extensive sick sinus syndrome<sup>[<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> and for that reason we must take
care when recommending the S-ICD procedure for chagasic patients.</p><p>One patient showed inappropriate shocks a week after the discharge due to oversensing
caused by myopotentials and a reintervention to replace the lead was performed
because the programming optimization was unsuccessful (in this case, it is very
limited). One of the limitations inherent to the device is the presence of
inappropriate shocks occurring in up to 8.4% of the cases<sup>[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>: T-wave oversensing is responsible for 80% of the
cases and myopotential oversensing for 5-10%<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>There was a case of edema in pulse generator pocket with intense pain beginning five
days after discharge. The diagnostics of the ultrasound test performed was not
really clarifying. A treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
and oral therapy with antibiotics over 7 days was prescribed, even without an
evidence of infection, since this was the post-operative of a prosthesis
implantation and a more bloody surgery although less invasive. This clinical
condition was solved with this prescription. Pocket infections in this procedure as
well as in the conventional one may occur in 5-10% of the cases, but in such cases
the solution with antibiotics therapy without the necessity of withdrawing the
system seems to be more probable and can be tried with less risk of
endocarditis<sup>[<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. Two
patients demanded medication for pain relief that last five days after the surgery.
It is important to notice that it is more bloody procedure than the conventional, so
we should consider a special post-surgery care, mainly in those pain sensitive
patients.</p><p>Initially, the motivation to develop this device was the possibility of treating
special cases such as the pediatric population with congenital heart disease,
patients without venous access or any other contraindication for a transvenous
ICD<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. Many advantages
inherent to the S-ICD currently turn it into not only an alternative to the
conventional ICD, but the first therapeutical choice for patients at high risk for
infection, immunosuppressed patients, patients with prosthetic valves and patients
dependent on hemodialysis, since besides the absence of risk for mechanical traumas,
such as vascular damages or pneumothorax, the risk for systemic infection is too
low<sup>[<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. Due to its
potential benefits, the S-ICD can be considered a feasible alternative for patients
with channelopathies, usually young and with a long-life expectancy, as well as for
primary and secondary prevention in ischemic and non-ischemic patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In our initial experience, the S-ICD implantation showed an acute efficacy to revert
induced VF during the procedure performed in pre-selected patients, but it should
take into account that in two out of 18 patients demanded high energy delivered
shocks in order to achieve this goal. In addition, although it is a less-invasive,
simple-accomplishment procedure, it resulted in a more bloody surgery perhaps
requiring an operative care different from the conventional. Inappropriate shock by
oversensing is a reality in this system, which should be overcome in order not to
become a limiting issue for its indication.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col width="50%" span="1"/><col width="50%" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Authors' roles &#x00026; responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FSOS</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Substantial contributions to the conception or design

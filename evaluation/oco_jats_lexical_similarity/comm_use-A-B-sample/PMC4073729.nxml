Whether responders were asked to complete questions 15 and 17 was dependent on their answers to questions 12 and 15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). Responses to question 12 were categorised as Yes (&#x02018;Yes&#x02019; or &#x02018;Yes, but I had to call back closer to or on the day I wanted the appointment&#x02019;) or No (&#x02018;No&#x02019;); responses of &#x02018;Can&#x02019;t remember&#x02019; (3% of weighted total) were excluded from the calculation of the relative frequencies. Responses to question 15 were categorised as Convenient (&#x02018;Very convenient&#x02019; or &#x02018;Fairly convenient&#x02019;) or Inconvenient (&#x02018;Not very convenient&#x02019; or &#x02018;Not at all convenient&#x02019;).

A bootstrap procedure with 500 000 repetitions was used to obtain the standard error and 99.9% CIs for the second parameter.

The relevant ratio was calculated for each subsample and then averaged, across subsamples, to obtain the ratio for each bootstrap sample; the CIs were derived from the observed distribution of these averaged ratios. A sensitivity analysis was conducted varying the number of consultations by &#x000b1;12% (&#x02013;12% is equal to the number of consultations previously estimated for 2008&#x02013;2009) and the ratio parameter by &#x000b1;25%.

Although the percentage of attempts to obtain a general practice appointment that result in an A&#x00026;E attendance appears to be small, the absolute effect is estimated to be large due to the considerable number of attempts to obtain appointments each year. Notably, the point estimate of 5.77 million A&#x00026;E attendances corresponds to a substantially larger proportion of the unplanned A&#x00026;E attendance workload than the total general practice workload (26.5% and 1.7% respectively in 2012&#x02013;2013). Therefore, a change in utilisation patterns that may seem trivial in terms of demand for general practice services could have a considerable effect on A&#x00026;E departments.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>A national, validated patient survey was used to provide a novel estimate that is highly relevant to contemporary policy. However, the method does make several assumptions. First, it assumes that the linear trend in the annual number of general practice consultations observed between 2000&#x02013;2001 and 2008&#x02013;2009 continued through to 2012&#x02013;2013. The method also assumes that a patient&#x02019;s last attempt to obtain an appointment is representative of other attempts made in the year, and that patients&#x02019; propensities to subsequently visit an A&#x00026;E department are independent of how often they attempt to obtain a general practice appointment. Furthermore, it is not possible to determine whether those patients who report subsequently visiting an A&#x00026;E department had an objective clinical need to do so, or know the magnitude and direction of any possible bias in patients&#x02019; responses. This includes reporting bias, which could result from responders selecting answers they perceive to be of greater interest in the GP Patient Survey. Non-response bias could also be present if responding is influenced by factors unaccounted for by the weighting scheme used. Validation of the GPPS with data routinely recorded in general practices and A&#x00026;E departments would be useful, to ascertain whether patients&#x02019; reported activity is consistent with administrative records. Moreover, since the GPPS only samples adults, the method assumes that the relative frequencies of outcomes of consultation attempts for children are equal to those for adults. The narrow 99.9% CIs demonstrate that any random error in the results obtained is small. While this analysis is exploratory, the results of the sensitivity analysis provide a range of values that do not alter the study conclusion: a large number of A&#x00026;E attendances are likely to be preceded by unsuccessful attempts to obtain convenient general practice appointments in England each year.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with existing literature</title><p>The estimates presented seem plausible when compared to other figures, including those obtained from studies of type 3 A&#x00026;E departments (such as walk-in centres and urgent care centres<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). For example, in a survey of 1886 patients attending 20 walk-in centres throughout England, 22% of responders registered to a general practice elsewhere had tried but were unable to obtain a convenient general practice appointment.<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> At an urgent care centre co-located with an emergency department in London, England, 20% of surveyed patients attending with &#x02018;minor illness&#x02019; had been unable to obtain a timely general practice appointment;<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> 58% of patients had stated that one reason for their attendance was that it was &#x02018;quicker than getting a GP appointment&#x02019;,<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and the large majority of all attendees could have been managed by a GP or emergency nurse practitioner.<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> A GP panel review of a random sample of 629 clinical case notes from patients attending an emergency department in Oxford, England, concluded that approximately 43% of patients could have been managed by a GP.<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Nationally, patients were recorded as receiving no treatment or advice only in 47% of A&#x00026;E attendances and no investigation in 41% of attendances in 2012&#x02013;2013.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Implications for research and policy</title><p>Future research could include a survey of a nationally representative sample of patients attending A&#x00026;E departments of all types to provide a further estimate of the percentage that had tried but were unable to obtain a general practice appointment or a convenient appointment. Such research could also estimate the percentage of attendees that visited an A&#x00026;E department without first contacting their general practice because they anticipated difficulties in obtaining a timely appointment, which it was not possible to do within this analysis.</p><p>Although a significant number of A&#x00026;E attendances occurring in England each year are likely to be related to access to general practice, it does not necessarily follow that ensuring timely access will reduce the occurrence of A&#x00026;E attendances. Additional demand for general practice appointments, which may or may not align with the unmet clinical needs of a population, could also be induced by such policy. These hypotheses require testing in further research employing high-quality designs. The existing literature on the effect of primary care interventions on A&#x00026;E attendances is limited by low-quality study designs.<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> However, the UK government&#x02019;s pilot scheme of extended general practice opening hours provides an opportune natural experiment with which to examine this intervention&#x02019;s effect on the occurrence of A&#x00026;E attendances; it should be rigorously evaluated.</p></sec></sec></body><back><notes><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This report is independent research supported by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) (Doctoral Research Fellowship, Thomas Cowling, DRF-2013-06-142; Doctoral Research Fellowship, Daniel Gibbons, DRF-2011-04-054; Academic Clinical Lectureship, Matthew Harris, LDN-930-038-A).

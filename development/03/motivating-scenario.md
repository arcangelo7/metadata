## Name
Citation functions

## Description
Characterise the function(s) of a citation created by the inclusion of an in-text reference pointer (or multiple in-text reference pointers) denoting the same bibliographic reference in a document, and explore clusters of citation functions grouped by context (e.g. section).

## Example

Consider the following article:

```
Piwowar H, Priem J, Larivière V, Alperin JP, Matthias L, Norlander B, Farley A, West J, Haustein S. 2018. The state of OA: a large-scale analysis of the prevalence and impact of Open Access articles. PeerJ 6:e4375 doi:10.7717/peerj.4375
```

Consider the following in-text references that appear in the full-text of the article:

```
Section “Introduction”
“Third, Sci-Hub (a website offering pirate access to full text articles) has built an enormous user base, provoking newly intense conversation around the ethics and efficiency of paywall publishing (Bohannon, 2016; Greshake, 2017).”

Section “Methods”
“At the time of writing, oaDOI processes approximately 500,000 requests daily–roughly twice the daily uses of Sci-Hub (Bohannon, 2016).”
```

The in-text references denote the following bibliographic references, hereon called paper Y and paper Z

```
[paper Y] Bohannon J. 2016. Who’s downloading pirated papers? Everyone. Science 352(6285):508-512

[paper Z] Greshake B. 2017. Looking into Pandora’s Box: the content of Sci-Hub and its usage [version 1; referees: 2 approved, 2 approved with reservations] F1000Research 6 Article 541
```

 * In the first case Paper Y is cited as evidence for the statement.
 * In the second case paper Y is cited as source of data.
